        Beatrice Kneeland, who helped to establish the Hartford College for Women in 1939 and had served as a trustee since then, died on Sunday at the Cherry Brook Health Center in Canton, Conn. She was 99 and lived in Bloomfield.
        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said her niece, Annabelle Hall Noland of Oakton, Va.
        In 1939, when Mount Holyoke College announced the closing of its Hartford campus, Mrs. Kneeland was among a small group of people that raised money to establish an independent college. Begun as a two-year liberal arts college, it became part of the University of Hartford system in 1991.
        Her husband, Henry Tracy Kneeland, died in 1986.
