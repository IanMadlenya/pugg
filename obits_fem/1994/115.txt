        Ivy Clarke, a former general manager of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, died on Wednesday night at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, said Meg Gordean, a friend.
        Miss Clarke met Mr. Ailey in the mid-1950's when he danced on Broadway in "House of Flowers," a show in which her sister, Lou Camacho, also performed. An X-ray technician by profession, Miss Clarke assisted Mr. Ailey in many capacities, first as a volunteer seamstress in the early days of his company and as general manager from 1968 to 1975. She later set up her own dance management firm and was familiar at modern-dance concerts until she died.
        Miss Clarke is survived by two other sisters, Catherine Rald and Maria Erskine, both of New York City.
