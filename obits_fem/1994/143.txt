        Natalia Danesi Murray, a publishing executive and book editor in New York from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on Thursday at her son's home in Del Mar, Calif. She was 92.
        The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement by the Helen Brann Agency.
        Mrs. Murray was the head of the New York office of the Italian publishing house Mondadori in the 1950's. Later, she was the director of the New York office of Rizzoli, another Italian publisher, from the 1960's through the 1970's. She was instrumental in taking the works of American writers to Italian readers.
        In 1985, Random House published "Darlinghissima: Letters to a Friend," by Janet Flanner, who, under the pseudonym Genet, wrote the "Letter From Paris" column in The New Yorker. Mrs.Murray, a longtime friend of Miss Flanner, edited the book and added commentary.
        Mrs. Murray was born in Rome. In 1924 she married William Murray, the head of the William Morris Agency in New York, and moved to New York. They were divorced in 1936. Mrs. Murray acted on Broadway in the 1930's.
        In World War II she helped NBC broadcast a short-wave news program to Italy.
        She is survived by her son, William Murray, an author and foreign correspondent, and three grandchildren, all of Del Mar.
