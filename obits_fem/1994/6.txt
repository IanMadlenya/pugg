        Joan Avnet, an art collector, dealer and philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.
        The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter Rosalind Avnet Lazarus.
        Mrs. Avnet was the widow of Lester Avnet, founder of Avnet Inc., a distributor of electronics components. As collectors, the Avnets focused primarily on Old Master and Modern drawings, assembling major holdings in 20th-century drawings by European and American artists. Of the 900 works they acquired between 1960 and Mr. Avnet's death in 1970, 180 drawings were donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1978.
        Formed in consultation with the museum, the gift collection came to include theatrical drawings by Jim Dine, early drawings by Picasso and others by Jean Dubuffet, Lionel Feininger, Jackson Pollock, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele and Leon Bakst. They also gave the museum drawings by Balthus, Chagall, Matisse, Modigliani and Rouault.  Other Gifts
        The Avnets also made gifts to the Institute of Molecular Biology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Joan and Lester Avnet Division of Laboratories at the North Shore University Hospital and the Joan and Lester Avnet Chair in Ethics at the Jewish Theological Seminary.
        In the 1960's Mrs. Avnet owned a gallery in Great Neck, L.I., and later was a private art dealer in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mrs. Avnet was born in New York and attended Hunter College. Her second marriage, to Dr. Karl Fischbach, ended in divorce.
        In addition to Mrs. Lazarus, of New York and Washington, she is survived by another daughter, Carole Avnet Rocherolle of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Jonathan Avnet, a film director and producer of Topanga Canyon, outside Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.
