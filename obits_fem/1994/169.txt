        Jane Elizabeth Richmond, a writer with a special interest in films and television, died on Monday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 57 and had homes in Pawcatuck, Conn., and Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Ms. Richmond, a native of Westerly, R.I., was a graduate of Barnard College and worked in advertising before turning to editing and writing. As an editor for Partisan Review, she was associated with the Beat writers. She also served as a literary assistant to Mary McCarthy.
        Her fiction and nonfiction appeared in Partisan Review, The New Yorker and other publications. She also wrote for television and adapted several short plays from the repertory of the Grand Guignol Theater of Paris for presentation in the United States.
        Ms. Richmond is survived by her father, Richard, and a brother, Barry, both of Stonington, Conn.
