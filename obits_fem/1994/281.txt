        Elinor F. Poindexter, a Manhattan dealer in contemporary art, died on Sunday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 88.
        The cause was pneumonia, said her son, Joseph.
        Before she became a dealer, Mrs. Poindexter collected the works of both abstract and figurative painters with her husband, George, a commodities broker. He died in 1975.
        She founded the Poindexter Gallery in 1955 and showed the works of New York and California artists like Richard Diebenkorn, Al Held, Jules Olitski, Nell Blaine and Robert De Niro. The gallery closed in 1978.
        Mrs. Poindexter, originally Elinor Fuller, was born in Montreal, but grew up on Staten Island. She was graduated from Finch College in Manhattan.
        Earlier this year, she donated 36 acres in Easton to the Aspetuck Land Trust, the largest such gift ever to the Fairfield County Land Conservancy.
        In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie of Cincinnati and Christie Dennis of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Leslie Randall of Newton, Conn., and eight grandchildren.
