        Charlotte N. Montgomery, a pioneering consumer writer, died on Nov. 10 in Amherst Nursing Home in Amherst, Mass., where she had lived since April. She was 90 and had lived in Westfield, N.J., for most of her life.
        She died of pneumonia, said her daughter, Sarah Montgomery of South Hadley, Mass.
        A journalist whose career began as the country's production was shifting into new technologies and goods after World War II, she wrote about consumers' needs as well as manufacturers' responsibilities. A column she wrote, "Speaker for the House," appeared in Good Housekeeping magazine from 1955 to 1982.
        She graduated from Vassar in 1927.
        She is also survived by a son, Harry, of Belchertown, Mass., and four grandchildren.
