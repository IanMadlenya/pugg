        Sonia Raiziss, a New York literary figure for many years, died on March 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said Alfredo de Palchi, her collaborator and former husband.
        A poet, translator and critic, Ms. Raiziss was an editor of Chelsea, a semi-annual avant-garde literary magazine featuring poems and prose by promising new writers. She became an editor of the magazine in 1960, two years after its founding.
        Chelsea published early work by such authors as Sylvia Plath, Umberto Eco, Raymond Carver and Grace Paley. Many of its back numbers are collectors' items. Published as High School Student
        A native of Germany, Ms. Raiziss was brought to this country as a child and grew up in Philadelphia. Her earliest poems were published while she was in high school, and her subsequent work appeared widely in literary magazines.
        She earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of Philadelphia, where her father, the biochemist Dr. George W. Raiziss, was a professor. She also studied at Columbia University and published her first collection of poems, "Through a Glass Darkly," as a student at the Sorbonne.
        Her first book of criticism, "Metaphysical Passion: Seven Modern American Poets and the 17th-Century Tradition," was published in 1952 by the University of Philadelphia and reissued by Greenwood Press in 1970. "Bucks County Blues," a volume of her poetry that appeared in 1977, also remains in print.
        Most recently, she was the translator of "The Scorpion's Dark Dance" (1993), a volume of Italian poetry by Mr. de Palchi.
        She is survived by a son, Peter St. Mu Raiziss of Sacramento, Calif.
