        Dr. Margaret E. Courain, a retired information manager for the Federal Government and the pharmaceutical industry, died Jan. 13 at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 66.
        The cause was cancer, said Jacqueline Algon, a friend.
        Starting in 1949 Dr. Courain spent 32 years at Merck & Company in Rahway, N.J., where she developed research information systems and provided development and education programs for corporate management. From 1981 until her retirement in 1987 she served with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, where she was the deputy assistant administrator of its National Environmental Satellites, Data and Information Service.
        She is survived by two brothers, Edward and Gerald, and a sister, Helen Courain, all of Bayonne, N.J.
