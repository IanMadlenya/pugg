        Margaret Janus, who helped her brother, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, in assisted suicides, died today at Sinai Hospital here. She was 68 and lived in Troy, Mich.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her physician, Dr. Stanley Levy.
        Mrs. Janus, who was called Margo, kept all the patient records involving the assisted suicides, and videotaped sessions between her brother and the 20 patients he helped commit suicide since 1990. She was present at the first 15 of the suicides, and later helped organize meetings of the survivors of Dr. Kevorkian's patients. She also worked in Dr. Kevorkian's campaign for a statewide referendum on doctor-assisted suicide.
        "She was my record-keeper, my videographer and my chronicler," Dr. Kevorkian said. "She was also my supporter when I had no other supporters."
        She was born in Pontiac, Mich., and was an executive secretary for various companies, including the Chrysler Corporation.
        Mrs. Janus was divorced. In addition to her brother, she is survived by her daughter, Ava, of Troy, and a sister, Flora Holzheimer, of Schmalwasser, Germany.
