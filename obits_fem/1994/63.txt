        Aurelia Schober Plath, an educator and the editor of the correspondence of her daughter, the poet Sylvia Plath, died on Friday at the North Hill Health Center in Needham, Mass. She was 87, and lived in North Hill, Mass.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said her son, Warren J. Plath of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
        Ms. Plath was born in Boston and grew up in Winthrop, Mass. In 1942 she became an instructor at Boston University's College of Practical Arts and Letters, where she developed a program for training medical secretaries. She became an associate professor before retiring in 1971.
        After teaching for two years at Cape Cod Community College in Hyannis, Mass., she devoted herself to editing the personal correspondence of her daughter, who committed suicide in 1963. "Letters Home: Correspondence 1950-1963, by Sylvia Plath" was published in 1975 and formed the basis for the play of the same name by Rose Leiman Goldemberg.
        In addition to her son, she is survived by a brother, Frank Schober of West Chester, Pa., three granddaughters and a grandson.
