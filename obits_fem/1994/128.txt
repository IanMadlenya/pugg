        Muriel R. Cooper, a graphic designer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died on Thursday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. Professor Cooper, who lived in Brookline, Mass., was 68.
        She died of a heart attack, officials at M.I.T. said.
        Ms. Cooper joined the M.I.T. Press in 1967 as its first art director and helped produce more than 500 books. She began teaching at M.I.T. in 1974, concentrating on the relationship between graphics and technology. She became an assistant professor in 1977 and a full professor in 1988.
        Ms. Cooper was a graduate of Ohio State University and the Massachusetts College of Art. In 1992 she was the first recipient of the Robert P. Gersin Design Excellence Award, given to graduates of the Massachusetts College of Art.
        She is survived by two sisters, Helene Berger of Boston and Charlotte Lopoten of Philadelphia.
