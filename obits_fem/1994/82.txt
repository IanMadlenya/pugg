        Sarah Patton Boyle, an author who was active in civil rights matters, died on Feb. 20 at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 87.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said her son Roger.
        Mrs. Boyle described her experiences as a white Southern woman coming to understand the problems of many black Americans in her book "The Desegregated Heart" (1962). Her other books on human relations were "For Human Beings Only" (1964) and "The Back Together Heart" (1966). Her last book, "The Desert Blooms" (1985), described her personal experiences with aging.
        In addition to her son Roger, of Cos Cob, Conn., she is survived by another son, the Rev. Patton L. Boyle of Corvallis, Ore.
