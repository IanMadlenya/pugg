        Peggy Newcomer Pollack, the recently named associate publisher of Mademoiselle magazine, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 38 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was colon cancer, said Nancy Newcomer Vick, her sister.
        Ms. Pollack was previously the magazine's advertising director. Earlier she was advertising director of Mirabella magazine.
        She was born in Lancaster, Pa., and received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in French literature from New York University.
        In addition to her sister Nancy Vick, of Bedford, N.Y., she is survived by her companion, Paul Wigsten; her parents, Judge Clarence C. and Jane Newcomer, of Lancaster, Pa., and Philadelphia, and another sister, Judy Birkett of Lancaster.
        A scholarship fund has been established in Ms. Pollack's name at Cornell University.
