        Anita Zahn, a longtime teacher of the technique and dances of Isadora Duncan and her sister Elizabeth Duncan, died on Nov. 3 at her home in Grants Pass, Ore. She was 91.
        The Daily Courier in Grants Pass announced her death. It said Miss Zahn had moved to Oregon in 1986 from New York City, where she had begun teaching at the Isadora Duncan School of Dance in 1924.
        Ms. Zahn's legacy to her American pupils was somewhat different from that handed down by Isadora Duncan's adopted daughters, known as the Isadorables. Unlike them, Ms. Zahn was a direct disciple of Elizabeth Duncan, who directed her sister's school in Grunewald, Germany, before World War I. In 1911, Elizabeth opened her own school in Darmstadt. Ms. Zahn, who was born in Baden-Baden, studied there and later followed Elizabeth to the United States.
        She is survived by a son, Eddie Bauman; two granddaughters, and a great-granddaughter, all of Grants Pass.
