        Princess Lucie Jadot Shirazi, a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.
        The cause was cancer, said Roberto Mitrotti, co-executor of her estate.
        The princess was president of the Shirazi Wildlife Foundation, which supports sanctuaries in the United States, Belgium and France. She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and a chairwoman of the Polonaise Ball.
