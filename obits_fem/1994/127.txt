        Dorothy H. Davis, one of the elite group of female pilots who won their wings and the respect of their male colleagues flying military aircraft during World War II, died on Wednesday at her home in San Francisco. She was 77.
        Miss Davis suffered from Parkinson's disease and cancer, said a friend, Cliff Olson.
        Miss Davis was one of the women who volunteered for pilot training and flew missions testing searchlight defenses, towing targets for gunnery training and ferrying planes around the world during the war.
        In all, 1,074 women were members of what was known as the Women Air Service Pilots. The women flew virtually every type of aircraft: fighters, heavy bombers, transports and search planes. Regulations of the time barred women from flying in combat, but their service freed male pilots to fly missions in war zones.
        The Wasps, as the female pilots were widely called, were disbanded at the end of World War II and their contributions to the war effort were largely ignored. They were even denied the disability and health benefits available to male pilots.
        But in the late 1970's, Miss Davis led a campaign that began in San Francisco to have the Federal Government officially recognize the women as military veterans.
        To gain public attention and backing, she would often don her old Wasp uniform and take her campaign to moviegoers standing in line.
        Partly as a result of her efforts, Congress passed the G.I. Improvement Act in 1977, which led to official recognition of the Wasps as having been in active military service during World War II.
        Miss Davis was a retired claims adjudicator for the Veterans Administration.
