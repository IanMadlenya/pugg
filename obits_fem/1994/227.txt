        Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.
        The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.
        Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.
        Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.
        Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.
