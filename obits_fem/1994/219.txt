        Dr. Margaret Olds Strahl, a retired New York psychiatrist and analyst known for her research on the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, died on Monday at the William Hill Health Care Center in Easton, Md. She was 77.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.
        Dr. Strahl was born in New York City, received her medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine in 1943 and completed her training in psychoanalysis at Columbia University in 1948. She was an associate in psychiatry at Columbia until 1966.
        From 1968 to 1991, she worked at the New York Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center, while also keeping a private practice as a psychoanalyst, preparative psychotherapist and diagnostic consultant.
        In the 1980's, she also worked for the Veterans Administration, specializing in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders among Vietnam veterans.
        She was the author, co-author or editor of several volumes, including "Masked Schizophrenia: Diagnosis and a Unified Method of Treatment" (1980), "Differential Diagnosis in Clinical Psychiatry" (1972) and "The Complete Psychiatrist: The Achievements of Paul H. Hoch, M.D." (1968). An environmentalist, she donated a 400-acre family farm to the Chesapeake Audubon Society for an educational center in Easton.
        Her husband, William E., died in 1974.
        She is survived by two sons, Eric R., of Prescott, Ariz., and Dr. Stuart D., of Easton, and two granddaughters.
