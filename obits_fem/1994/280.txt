        Alice Miller, the director of the Brooklyn College Women's Center since 1985, died on Monday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 46 and lived in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.
        The cause was cancer, said Richard Coniglione, a spokesman for Brooklyn College.
        The Women's Center, which provides various services for students, teachers and others, acts as an advocate for women on issues like educational equity and sexual harassment. The center also co-sponsors lectures and conferences on topics like women's health, professions and the arts.
        In 1987, Ms. Miller founded the Eureka Teen Achievement Program, which the college describes as "a math and science enrichment program for minority and disadvantaged teen-age women." The program has been emulated elsewhere around the country.
        From 1986 to 1988, she was on the board of Women's Survival Space, a shelter for battered women.
        A native New Yorker, Ms. Miller, whose maiden name was Lokiec, graduated from Barnard College in 1968 and earned an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College and from New York University.
        She taught in junior and senior high schools, was an editor and a freelance writer and was director of the women's center and adult education at the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. before heading the college's women's center.
        Her survivors include her husband, Sandy Miller, and a daughter, Nell Miller, also of Carroll Gardens.
