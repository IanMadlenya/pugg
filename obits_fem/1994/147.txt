        Virginia Randolph Grace, an American archeologist who spent more than six decades studying the ancient civilizations of Greece, Cyprus and Egypt, died on May 22 at her home in Athens. She was 93.
        She had suffered a brief illness, said Nicholas Grace, a nephew and executor of her estate.
        Dr. Grace was a member of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens and the Agora Museum, which the school operates. Since her first trip to Greece in 1927 she had been known for her work in enhancing the accuracy of dating objects from archeological excavations.
        Her specialty was the study of amphoras. Using stamps preserved on many amphora handles that indicate the place and date of manufacture, she documented the thriving Mediterranean wine trade of ancient times. She used amphoras recovered from wrecks or dug up at ports as invaluable tools for tracing patterns of commerce.
        Dr. Grace was born in New York City and graduated from Bryn Mawr College, where she also earned her doctorate in classical archeology. In World War II she worked in Cyprus to preserve excavation records against war damage.
        Besides Mr. Grace, she is survived by 13 other nephews and nieces, and many grandnephews and grandnieces.
