        Patricia Miller King, director of the Radcliffe College library devoted to the history of women, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. Dr. King, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., was 56.
        The cause was lung cancer, a Radcliffe announcement said.
        In 1973 she became director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. In her 21-year tenure the library evolved into one of the nation's foremost centers for women's history. In 1993 the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation donated $2 million to endow the libarary's directorship.
        Dr. King was also an officer of the National Council for Research on Women, the American Antiquarian Society and the Massachusetts Historical Society.
        She graduated from Radcliffe in 1959 and received a doctorate in medieval history from Harvard University in 1970. As a graduate student she worked at the Women's Archives, a resource center that preceded the Schlesinger Library.
        She is survived by three daughters, Victoria King of Minneapolis, Ellen Stein-Samel of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Amy Stein of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Mark Stein of Hamilton, Mass.; her mother, Amy Miller, and a brother, Donald Miller, both of New Port Richey, Fla., and three grandchildren.
