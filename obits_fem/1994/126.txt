        Dr. Dorothy F. Berezin, a child psychologist who served as a municipal welfare official from 1969 to 1978, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.
        The cause was kidney disease, said her daughter, Judith A. Berezin.
        Dr. Berezin served as an assistant commissioner and director of child and adolescent services for the New York City Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services from 1971 to 1978. Previously she had been chief research scientist at that department involved in program planning.
        She was a graduate of Smith College and received a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University Teachers College.
        She is survived by two daughters, Judith, of Manhattan, and Joan Berezin of Berkeley, Calif.
