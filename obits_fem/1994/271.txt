        Janet Ahlberg, who created the illustrations for a series of memorable children's books written by her husband, Allan, died on Tuesday in Leicester, England. She was 50.
        The cause was cancer, said a statement from the Ahlbergs' publisher, Little, Brown & Company.
        Together, Mrs. Ahlberg and her husband produced more than 40 books for young readers. Their first effort, "The Brick Street Boys," appeared in 1975 and was followed by, among others, "Burglar Bill," "Each Peach Pear Plum," "Funnybones," "Peepo!" and "The Baby's Catalogue."
        "The Jolly Postman," published in 1986, was highly successful. The rhyming story featured a mailman on a bicycle who delivers letters to familiar fairy tale characters. Inside the book were envelopes with amusing surprises, including a letter of apology from Goldilocks to the Three Bears. "The Jolly Postman" sold more than a million copies and was followed in 1991 by "The Jolly Christmas Postman."
        In The New York Times Book Review, Daniel Menaker praised the sequel as "a mild, sweet, amusing book" and said "the authors have taken the secrets of the first book's popularity -- cleverness, detail, surprise and humor -- and amplified them."
        Mrs. Ahlberg had completed work on a third volume, "Jolly Pocket Postman," which is to be published next fall by Little, Brown.
        She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Jessica.
