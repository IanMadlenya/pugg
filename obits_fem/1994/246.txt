        Prof. Marion Wilson Starling, a scholar of African-American history and professor emeritus at Brooklyn College, died on Oct. 14 at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Richard Coniglione, a spokesman for Brooklyn College.
        Professor Starling drew national attention in 1981 with the publication of "The Slave Narrative: Its Place in American Literary History," which told the history of slavery in America in the words of its victims.
        Born in Zion City, Ill., Professor Starling graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1928 from Hunter College, where she majored in Latin and Greek. She was awarded a master's degree from Columbia University in 1929 and a Ph. D. from New York University in 1946.
        From 1930 to 1943 she taught at Spelman College in Atlanta as a professor of English and speech. She was also a visiting professor of African-American history and literature at Morris Brown College in Atlanta.
        She joined the English department at Brooklyn College in 1946. In 1954, she introduced the first courses in literature produced by black Americans at the college.
        She was a past treasurer of the Professional Staff Congress of the City University of New York. Hunter elected her to its College Hall of Fame in 1983.
        Professor Starling is survived by her daughter, Tiffany Starling, also of Manhattan.
