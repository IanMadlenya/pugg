        Edwina d'Erlanger, the widow of Baron Leo d'Erlanger, died Aug. 18 in a hospital in Geneva, where she had lived since 1975. She was 87.
        The cause of death was a stroke, according to her sister, Mary Whelan Prue Warburg.

        Later, she was chosen to model for the haute-couture house of Jean Patou in Paris. She stayed on in Europe to perform as a ballroom dancer under the name Edwina Saint Clair.
        On her return to New York, she was the understudy for June Walker in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," leaving to be married to Baron d'Erlanger in 1929. The couple divided their time between London and Tunis.
        She was married for more than 50 years to the Baron, who died 10 years ago.
        She is survived by a son, Rodolphe, of London; a daughter, Tess d'Erlanger, of Oxford, England; three grandsons, and her sister, of Wilton, Conn..
        She was buried in Geneva.
