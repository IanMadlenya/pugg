        Miriam K. Carliner, a Federal specialist on poverty and sexual bias in education, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 73.
        The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.
        A native of Bad Kreuznach, Germany, Mrs. Carliner migrated to the United States as a teen-ager and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1942 from George Washington University.
        She dealt with problems of disadvantaged students in the District of Columbia school system and directed a study by the League of Women Voters that examined the allocation of resources among the schools of neighborhoods in the District in 1965.
        In 1964 and 1965, she coordinated a conference for 27,000 people involved in Head Start, the early-education program for disadvantaged children.
        As a senior program officer in the United States Office of Education, she oversaw demonstration projects aimed at the disadvantaged.
        In 1980, Mrs. Carliner was appointed to direct the Woman's Action Program of the Department of Health and Human Services. She reported on sex discrimination in the department and assessed programs affecting women.
        After she left the Government in 1985, she became a mediator for the District of Columbia's Superior Court and sat on the District's Civilian Complaint Review Board.
        Mrs. Carliner is survived by her husband of 50 years, David; a son, Geoffrey, of West Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Deborah Carliner of Washington; a brother, Karl Kalter of Munich, and four grandchildren.
