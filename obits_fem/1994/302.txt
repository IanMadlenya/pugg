        Sylvia S. (Shethar) Everdell, a champion amateur sailor and equestrian, died on Monday in her home in Boston. She was 74.
        The cause was heart failure, said her husband, Romeyn.
        A native New Yorker who graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1943, Mrs. Everdell won the national women's sailing championships in 1939, 1940, 1947 and 1971. At age 17, she captured the Maclay Cup, the top horsemanship prize for junior riders.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Susan Clippinger and Rosalind Everdell, both of Jamaica Plain, Mass.; two sons, John of Jamaica Plain and Peter of Littleton, Mass., and four grandchildren.
