        Federica Montseny, the first woman to serve as a Cabinet minister in Spain, where she secured passage of a law in 1937 allowing women to have abortions, died on Jan. 14 in Toulouse, France, where she and other Spanish Republicans settled as exiles in the late 1930's. She was 88.
        Mrs. Montseny was born in Madrid to a couple from Catalonia. Her parents were both writers with an anarchist philosophy, and she became an anarchist herself. As a teen-ager, she began writing for union publications.
        During Spain's short-lived second Republic, she became Minister of Health in the coalition Government of Prime Minister Largo Caballero in 1936, at the outbreak of the Civil War, which pitted the Republicans against the Franco's forces. The abortion law was revoked when Franco came to power.
        In 1977, two years after Franco died, Mrs. Montseny returned to Spain for the first time. In later years she visited visit Spain now and then, but she continued to live in France, where she wrote about her past life, about women's rights and about union matters.
