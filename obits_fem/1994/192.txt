        Janis Carter, an actress in film and theater, and the co-host of the television quiz show "Feather Your Nest," died on Saturday in Durham, N.C. She was 80 and had homes in Longboat Key, Fla., Durham and Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Julius Stulman.
        Ms. Carter was born in Cleveland. She earned bachelor's degrees in English and music at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) and moved to New York to become an opera singer. For a time, she worked as a saleswoman at Bloomingdale's, wrote radio scripts for "Gangbusters" and sang in church choirs.
        She first gained critical notice in the Broadway musical "DuBarry Was a Lady," with Ethel Merman and Bert Lahr. Two years later, Darryl F. Zanuck spotted her in "Panama Hattie" and signed her to a contract at 20th Century-Fox, changing her last name from Dremann.
        In the 1940's and early 50's, she made a series of B films for Fox, Columbia and RKO, including "Cadet Girl" (1941) "The Girl in the Case" (1944), "Framed" (1947), "My Forbidden Past" (1951) and "Flying Leathernecks" (1952).
        In the mid-50's she appeared with Bud Collyer as a host on the television show "Feather Your Nest."
        She is survived by her husband.
