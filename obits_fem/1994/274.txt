        Norma Donaldson, whose sensuality and throaty voice entertained Broadway audiences, moviegoers and television viewers, died on Tuesday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Hollywood Hills.
        The cause was cancer, said her cousin, Lovely Hill Billups of Washington.
        Ms. Donaldson, born in Harlem, became a nightclub singer, touring with Harry Belafonte early in her career. On the concert stage she appeared with performers including Lena Horne, Billy Daniels and Lionel Hampton.
        Her most acclaimed appearance on Broadway came in 1976, when she took the girlishly nasal comedy lead of Miss Adelaide, the forever-unmarried show girl, in an all-black revival of Frank Loesser's "Guys and Dolls." Robert Guillaume played Nathan Detroit.
        On Broadway she also starred as Missy in "Purlie" and as Evie in "No Place to Be Somebody," both opposite Mr. Guillaume. She was Clara in "The Great White Hope" in Washington and, as a replacement, on Broadway with Yaphet Kotto. She also performed in "The Sunshine Boys," "Bubbling Brown Sugar" and "Kiss Me Kate," among others.
        In the movies, she was seen most recently in John Singleton's "Poetic Justice." Other appearances included roles in Robert Townsend's "Five Heart Beats," Sylvester Stallone's "Staying Alive" and Colin Higgins's "Nine to Five."
        At her death Ms. Donaldson had the recurring role of Lilliebelle Barber on the CBS daytime series "The Young and the Restless." She appeared in prime-time dramas, as well as in guest roles in the series "All in the Family," "Archie Bunker's Place," "The Jeffersons," "General Hospital" and "Farrell for the People."
        In addition to Ms. Billups, Ms. Donaldson is survived by her godmother, Longines Lewis of Mobile, Ala.; and two nieces, Jill B. Beltrans of Yorktown, N.Y., and Jina Billups of Manhattan.
