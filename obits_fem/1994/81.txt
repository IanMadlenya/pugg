        Dr. Edith Porada, a Columbia University art historian and archeologist, died on Thursday in Honolulu, where she was staying with her sister. She was 81 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        She suffered a brief illness, said Sidney Babcock, a family spokesman in New York.
        At her death, Dr. Porada was Arthur Lehman professor emeritus of art history and archeology at Columbia and honorary curator of seals and tablets at the Pierpoint Morgan Library. She joined the Columbia faculty in 1958 and was named a senior lecturer when she reached emeritus status 10 years ago.
        She also remained active at the Morgan Library where she held regular graduate seminars as recently as last December. Columbia University established an Edith Porada professorship of ancient Near Eastern art history and archeology in 1983 with a $1 million gift from an anonymous donor.
        A native of Vienna, Dr. Porada received a doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1935 and arrived in this country three years later. Before Columbia, she held positions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Queens College Art Department.
        One of the world's leading authorities on ancient cylinder seals, she organized and directed Columbia's excavations on the Phlamoudhi plain near the Mediterranean in northeastern Cyprus in the early 1970's. Digging on a remote hill, the explorers found a sanctuary of the Hellenistic period and evidence of close commercial ties between Cyprus and the Greek islands in the late Bronze Age, about 1500 B.C.
        Dr. Porada is survived by her sister, Hildegard Randolph.
