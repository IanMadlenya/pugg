        Mai Zetterling, the Swedish actress who went on to a career as one of Europe's busiest female film directors, died on Tuesday in London. She was 68 and had homes in London and in Banne, France.
        The cause was cancer, said her agent, Joyce Edwards.
        Ms. Zetterling was directing the film "The Woman Who Cleaned the World," which she had written, when she died.
        Mai Elisabeth Zetterling was born in Vasteras, Sweden, to a working-class family. She left school barely literate, according to her 1985 autobiography, "All Those Tomorrows."
        After working in a drug store and a mail-order company, she tried acting and was invited to join the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her stage and screen debuts when she was 17. Breakthrough in 'Torment'
        Her sensitive portrayal of a simple girl victimized by a sadistic professor in "Torment" (released in the United States in 1947), created a sensation and is now considered a landmark of the Swedish cinema. The film, directed by Alf Sjoberg and written by Ingmar Bergman, was released under the title "Frenzy" in England and made her an international star.
        She also appeared in "Frieda" (1947), "Desperate Moment" (1953), "Knock on Wood" with Danny Kaye (1954), "A Prize of Gold" with Richard Widmark (1955), "Abandon Ship!" with Tyrone Power (1957), "Only Two Can Play" with Peter Sellers (1961), "The Vine Bridge" (1965), "The Witches" (1990) and "Hidden Agenda" (1990).
        In the 1960's and 1970's she was one of the few women who found regular work as a director. Her first effort, "The War Game" (1963), a short documentary, won a first prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Many of her subsequent films dealt explicitly with female sexuality and focused on the role of women in society.
        Among her directorial credits are "Loving Couples" (1964), "Night Games" (1966), "Doctor Glas" (1968), "The Girls" (1969), "Vincent the Dutchman" (1975), "Lady Policeman" (1979), "Of Seals and Men" (1979) "Scrubbers" (1983) and "Amorosa" (1986).
        In later years she continued acting, co-starring with Anjelica Huston in Nicholas Roeg's 1990 film "The Witches."
        Ms. Zetterling also wrote children's books, short stories and novels, one of which, "Night Games," she adapted and directed for the screen.
        Her two marriages, to Tutte Lemkow, a Norwegian dancer, and the novelist David Hughes, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son and a daughter from her first marriage.
