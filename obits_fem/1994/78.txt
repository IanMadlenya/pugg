        Lynn Solotaroff, a translator from Russian and a teacher, died on Monday at the Jewish Home & Hospital in New York. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer and emphysema, her family said.
        Mrs. Solotaroff was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from the University of Michigan and studied Russian as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and Columbia University. At Columbia she became a visiting scholar at the Russian Institute -- now Harriman Institute -- and worked as its director of publications from 1977 to 1985.
        Among the books she translated was Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyitch" (1981). She also contributed to Avraham Yarmolinsky's translation of "Letters of Anton Chekhov" (1973), and most recently was working on her own edition and translation of Chekhov's stories.
        For the last several years she also taught English as a second language at City College and Touro College.
        Mrs. Solotaroff is survived by two sons, Paul, of Boston, and Ivan, of Manhattan; and two sisters, Bernice Silverstein of River Edge, N.J., and Sydelle Corwin of Potomac, Md. Her marriage to Ted Solotaroff ended in divorce.
