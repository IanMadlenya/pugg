        Lynne Murray Johnson, the wife of Belton Kleberg Johnson, an heir to the King Ranch in Kingsville, Tex., died on Sunday at her home in San Antonio. She was 50.
        The cause was cancer, said Janette Ganster, a spokeswoman for the Johnson family.
        Mrs. Johnson was born in Narromine, Australia, and moved to Mexico, where she was married to Ricardo Penafiel, an industrialist, who is deceased. She moved to San Antonio in the mid-1980's and married Mr. Johnson in 1990.
        She is survived by her husband; her mother, Sadie Murray, and her brother, Paul Murray, both of Newport Beach, Australia.
