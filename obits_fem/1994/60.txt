        Dorette Kruse Fleischmann, a civic leader and socialite in New York and Cincinnati, died yesterday at the Racquet Club in Chicago. She was 88.
        The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Joan Tobin.
        She and her husband, Julius Fleischmann, whose family made its fortune through yeast, were benefactors of many cultural and civic groups, including the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Opera and the Council on Foreign Affairs.
        Mrs. Fleischmann graduated from Smith College in 1927.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Charles Fleischmann 3d of Cincinnati; another daughter, Dorette Fleischmann of The Plains, Va.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
