        Raquel Adonaylo, a soprano who was on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, died on Tuesday at her home in Rosemont, Pa. She was 67.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Rony Rogoff, a family friend.
        An accomplished pianist, Miss Adonaylo gave recitals and appeared with orchestras in her native Uruguay before devoting herself to her singing career. She studied voice in France in the early 1950's and later performed in recitals, in chamber concerts and as a soloist with orchestras. She sang many major roles in operas produced by Uruguay's Symphony Orchestra.
        In 1960, she was invited to perform the premiere of Ginastera's "Cantata para America Magica" in Washington, a work she later recorded for Columbia Records. In 1963 she moved from Uruguay to Israel, where she sang with the Israel Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta and other conductors. She was also a regular participant at the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont and toured with Musicians From Marlboro. In 1975 she moved to the United States and joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute, where she taught until 1989.
        She is survived by her husband, Jacko Peniazek; a daughter, Ana, and two sons, Pablo and Eduard, all of Rosemont.
