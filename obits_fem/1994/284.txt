        Jeanne Sumner Newman, a public health specialist who worked to improve medical services in developing countries, died on Oct. 24 at West Virginia University Hospitals in Morgantown, W.Va. She was 65 and lived in Baltimore.
        She died from injuries suffered in a car accident on Oct. 7, said her daughter Katharine Newman Zohir. Dr. Newman had been traveling to an American Friends Service Committee Retreat in Charleston, W.Va., with her husband, John Brown Newman, who was also injured.
        As a consultant to the United States Agency for International Development, she evaluated health care in rural clinics and recommended revisions in supervision and training. In her work, she expanded the role of nursing technicians, who often were the only health workers in isolated places.
        She is also survived by another daughter, Pixie A. B. Newman of Chicago, a son, Jon of Glen Rock, Pa., and four grandchildren.
