        Joan Wolff, the director of the Allan Stone Gallery in Manhattan for 25 years, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 64.
        The cause was cancer, said Claudia Stone, a daughter of the owner of the art gallery.
        Mrs. Wolff went to work at the gallery, which is now on East 90th Street, east of Park Avenue, in 1968. She helped organize exhibitions of works by the gallery's artists Richard Estes and Wayne Thibaud, as well as shows of paintings by Arshile Gorki, Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning and John Graham.
        Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Margaret Joan Trott, was born in Akron, Ohio, and graduated from Oberlin College. She is survived by her husband, Raymond A. Wolff Jr., the leader of the Dutch Wolff Orchestra, a society band; two daughters, Margaret, of Seattle, and Melora, of Oneonta, N.Y., and a sister, Beverly Earle Knapp of New York City.
