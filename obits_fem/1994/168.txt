        Barbara Howell, a feminist novelist and short story writer, died on Tuesday in Lenox Hill Hospital. Ms. Howell, who lived in Manhattan, was 57.
        The cause was cancer, said her husband, Alan Woltz.
        Ms. Howell was the author of the novels "Joy Ride" (Viking, 1989) and "A Mere Formality" (M. Evans, 1984) and the nonfiction book "Don't Bother to Come in on Monday" (St. Martin's, 1973). She also wrote extensively for such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Vogue.
        She graduated from Barat College in Lake Forest, Ill., and was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Lille in 1957.
        She is survived by her husband and a son, William Leroy, both of Manhattan.

        An obituary headline on Thursday about Barbara Howell, a novelist and short-story writer, misstated her age. She was 57, not 59.
