        Nora Jaffe, a painter and sculptor, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Lee.
        A recurring theme in Mrs. Jaffe's work was the male nude, the subject of her first oil painting, when she was 12. Largely self-taught (although she studied briefly with Samuel Adler and David Hare), she began showing her art in 1960. Since then, she had been in group and solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum and galleries. Her last show was at the Virginia Lust Gallery in 1990.
        She did the covers for books by the poets Adrienne Rich and Clayton Eshelman.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Joseph, and a son, Kenneth A., all of New York City, and three brothers, Jeff Miller and Jack Miller of Delphos, Ohio, and Tom Miller of Arlington, Va.
