        Esther Sherman, a theatrical agent and a vice president of the William Morris Agency, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 56.
        The cause was cancer, the agency said.
        Ms. Sherman was a native of Newark. She joined William Morris in 1964 as a secretary in the Chicago office and was promoted to assistant in the personal appearance department in New York in 1962. She became an agent in 1973.
        One of her first clients was Howard Ashman, who went on to write "Little Shop of Horrors" and "The Little Mermaid." She also represented Edward Albee, Athol Fugard, John Patrick Shanley and Charles Fuller, among others.
        She is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, Allan and Susan Sherman, of Toms River, N.J.
