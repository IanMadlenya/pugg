        Dorothy Bernstein, a trustee and president of the auxiliary of the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn from 1972 to 1990, died yesterday at her home in Bellport, L.I. She was 80.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said her son, Herbert Bernstein.
        Mrs. Bernstein was active in community health programs in Brooklyn and in 1982 was given the Mayor's Volunteer Action Award for her work in health education and preventive medicine. She organized symposiums on nutrition, hypertension and nursing.
        For more than 40 years she also served as the office manager for her husband, Dr. David Bernstein, a surgeon who practiced medicine in Brooklyn until his death in 1988. Mrs. Bernstein graduated from Brooklyn College in 1935.
        She is survived by her son of Bellport; a daughter, Helen Young of Lawrenceville, N.J., and three grandchildren.
