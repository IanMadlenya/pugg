        Ann M. Sperber, whose biography of Edward R. Murrow was a best-seller in 1986, died on Friday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 58.
        The cause was an apparent heart attack, said her brother, Dr. Alan Sperber.
        Miss Sperber's book, "Murrow: His Life and Times" (Freundlich Books), was a well-received biography that was republished in paperback in 1987. She had spent over a decade writing the work and had first collected research material for it in Berlin while a Fulbright Scholar there in 1956-57.
        Before writing the book about Mr. Murrow, Miss Sperber was an editor of children's books for Putnam and McGraw-Hill. She graduated from Barnard College in 1956.
        She is survived by her mother, Lisa Sperber, and her brother, both of Manhattan.
