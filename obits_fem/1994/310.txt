        Mabel Julianelli, an innovator in couture shoe design, died on Friday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 85 and lived with her daughter, Jane, in Wainscott, L.I.
        The cause of death was complications from an infection, Jane Julianelli said.
        Mrs. Julianelli, whose career spanned 40 years, won the Coty American Fashion Critics Award in 1950 with her husband and partner, Charles Julianelli, for artistry and craftsmanship in shoe styles. Their company, Julianelli Shoes, became known in the 1960's for developing "the naked look," a light, airy style in footwear.
        In an article in The New York Times in 1964, Angela Taylor, a fashion writer, wrote that Mrs. Julianelli "ignored the rule that bare shoes come out only in spring and summer," designing several sandals for the fall, including "one that is virtually nothing but toe."
        She also broke the rule that said tailored shoes go with textured stockings, preferring a lightweight pump with a whimsical low round heel.
        Mrs. Julianelli, who was born in Brooklyn, is survived by her daughter, Jane.
