        Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn, the mother of Van Cliburn and his only piano teacher until he was 17, died yesterday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth. She was 97 and lived in Fort Worth.
        The cause was a stroke that occurred last Thursday, said Mary Lou Falcone, Mr. Cliburn's spokeswoman.
        Mrs. Cliburn's mother was an actress and her father was a judge and adviser to state officials. She studied music from an early age in Texas, then at the Cincinnati Conservatory and at the New York School of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.
        She returned to Texas in the 1920's to marry Harvey Levan Cliburn, an oil-company executive. She gave piano lessons, and discovered her son's ability when at the age of 3 he went to the piano after one of her students left and played by ear the piece that had just been taught.
        Mrs. Cliburn served as her son's adviser, manager and inspiration throughout his career. She was also active in the arts, and established a foundation to help young performers.
        Her husband died in 1974. She is survived by her son, of Fort Worth.
