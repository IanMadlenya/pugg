        Faith Cardwell Davis, who with her sisters Hope Cardwell Brock and Charity Cardwell Lawson had been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest complete set of triplets, died on Sunday at Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital in Sweetwater, Tex. She was 95.
        The cause of death was believed to be a heart attack, said Dan McCoy, director of McCoy Funeral Home in Sweetwater.
        The three sisters had lived together for more than a decade at a nursing home in Sweetwater, a small city on the plains of West Texas.
        Several experts on multiple births said that when the Cardwell sisters turned 95 last May, they were the first set of triplets on record to reach that age.
        Mrs. Davis had owned and operated the Silver Spur diner in Roby, Tex., for 25 years before moving to nearby Sweetwater in the early 1980's.
        Her husband, J. P. Davis, whom she married in 1920, died in 1980, and her son, James, died in 1986. She is survived by her sisters; two granddaughters, and three great-grandsons.
