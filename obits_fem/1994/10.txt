        Family members said she died of natural causes.
        An early champion of birth control, she helped establish the Greenwich Maternal Health Center in 1935.

        She also was a president of the Hortulus Garden Club and a chairwoman of the Red Cross Gray Ladies. She received many awards, including Nutmegger of the Decade and a distinguished alumna award from the Foxcroft School.
        Mrs. Rockefeller was the grandniece of Andrew Carnegie. Her husband, James Stillman Rockefeller, is a former president and chairman of Citibank and is a grandnephew of John D. Rockefeller.
        She is also survived by two sons, James S. Jr. of Camden, Me., and Andrew C. of Greenwich; two daughters, Nancy Coop of Germantown, Tenn., and Georgia Rose of Manhattan; 14 grandchildren, and 24 great-grandchildren.
