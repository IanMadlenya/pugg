        Natalie Hall Rowe, a musical-comedy star and opera singer in New York and London in the 1920's and 30's, died last Friday at her home in Edgecomb, Me. She was 89.
        The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Betty Gruendel of Edgecomb.
        As Natalie Hall, she made her Broadway debut in the chorus of "Iolanthe" in 1926. A lyric soprano, she then played a variety of roles with the American Opera Company from 1928 to 1930, including Marguerite in "Faust" and the leads in "Carmen" and "Yolanda in Cyprus."
        She appeared with her sister, Bettina, in "Three Little Girls" in 1931. The next year, she had roles in "Through the Years" and "Music in the Air."
        Miss Hall won critical acclaim for her performance as the lead in "The Merry Widow" in Central City, Colo., in 1933. Later that year, she went to London to star in the West End production of "Ball at the Savoy." Returning to New York, she played in "Music Hath Charms," "Otello" and "Nights of Song" and in a production of "Showboat" on Randalls Island in 1938.
        In the 1940's she lived in Hamilton, N.Y., where her husband, Edward C. Rowe, was a lawyer at Colgate University. In 1964 the couple moved to Maine, where Miss Hall appeared in many productions at the Brunswick Music Theater. Mr. Rowe died in 1974.
        Miss Hall was born in Warwick, R.I.
        She is survived by her daughter and a sister, Bettina Rubicam of Scottsdale, Ariz.
