        Peggy D. Pinn, an educator at Howard University and the founder of a television and film training program for minority students, died on April 6 at Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Md. She was 65 and lived in Rockville.
        The cause was a stroke, said Sigrid Sanders of Manhattan, a friend.
        Mrs. Pinn was born in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor's degree in education from City College and a master's degree in educational technology from Howard, in Washington. After writing columns for The Amsterdam News and The Queens Voice, she worked in the news and public-affairs department at CBS-TV and on the production staff of the PBS series "Black Journal."
        In 1971, she founded the National Educational Television Training School in New York, a program sponsored by WNET that was intended to prepare minority students for jobs in communications.
        From 1972 until her retirement in 1984, she lectured in the department of film and television at Howard, and served as the director of the university's department of continuing education and of its community-service programs.
        She is survived by a sister, Irma Kauderer of Fort Worth.
