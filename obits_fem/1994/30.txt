        Edith Weisbuch, a proponent of progressive education and benefactor of Brandeis University, died on Jan. 29 at her home in Kings Point, L.I. She was 89.
        The cause was cardiopulmonary complications, said her son Thomas B. Weisbuch.
        A graduate of Smith College, Mrs. Weisbuch worked for the creation of a department of child study at Tufts University. In later years she organized a Long Island chapter of the Brandeis Women's Committee, which provided support for the university.
        Mrs. Weisbuch is survived by three sons: Paul D. Berman of Manhattan, Jonathan B. Weisbuch of Los Angeles, and Thomas B. Weisbuch of Kings Point; two daughters, Betty W. Stone of Manchester, Mass., and Doris W. Soman of Pittsfield, Mass.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
