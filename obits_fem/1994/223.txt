        Ann Schreiber, a regional administrator in the Northeast United States and the Caribbean for the Department of Health and Human Services, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 58 and lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Sol Schreiber, a former Federal magistrate in Manhattan.
        As administrator for Region 2, consisting of New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Mrs. Schreiber headed a staff of 100 and was responsible for distributing $4 billion a year.
        An alumna of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Schreiber attended graduate school at Columbia University and was a midcareer fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University.
        Also surviving are her mother, Helen, and a sister, Carol Martini of Philadelphia.
