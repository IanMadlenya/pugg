        Camille Helene Block Lehman, a respected and innovative interior designer, died on Tuesday at her home in Atlanta. She was 84.
        A native of New York City, Mrs. Lehman began her career at 16, designing for a bathing-suit manufacturer. After graduating from the Parsons School of Design at 19, she was hired by the dress and jewelry designer Hattie Carnegie.
        Later, Mrs. Lehman thought of several applications in the home for Lucite, then a new product, and traveled the country marketing her ideas.
        Mrs. Lehman and her husband, Charles, founded Lehmans & Associates, which became a successful interior design firm. In 1966, she received a Burlington House award for outstanding interior design and space planning.
        She was a member of the Board of Governors of the American Institute of Interior Designers and a Fellow of the American Society of Interior designers.
        "No matter how ingenious her design solutions, she never forgot that real people were going to eat, sleep and live in the rooms she created," said Dorothy Kalins, editor of Garden Design magazine.
        The Lehmans continued to work in interior design until Mr. Lehman's death in 1990.
        She is survived by her sons, John and Jeffrey, and two granddaughters, Kristin and Heather.
