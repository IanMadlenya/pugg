         Gail Paradise Kelly, a professor of comparative education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, died on Friday at Buffalo General Hospital. She was 51 years old and lived in Buffalo.         She died of cancer, university officials said.         Dr. Kelly, who received a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was chairwoman of the Department of Educational Organization, Administration and Policy at the university's Graduate School of Education.         A professor of education at SUNY for 16 years, she was the author or editor of 13 books, including such standard texts as "New Approaches to Comparative Education," (University of Chicago Press, 1986) and "Comparative Education" (Macmillan Press, 1982). Her book "Vietnam to America" (Westview Press, 1977), was a serious look at the plight of Vietnamese refugees.         In the early 1960's, she was national secretary of the Student Peace Union, a group protesting the blockade of Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis.         She is survived by her husband, David Kelly, chairman of the history department at D'Youville College in Buffalo; two daughters, Jennifer, of Manhattan, and Elizabeth, of Buffalo; her father, Joseph Paradise of Rye, N.Y.; a sister, Judith Moskowitz of Manhattan, and a brother, Steven Paradise of Washington.       
         Muriel Stuart, an English-born ballerina who danced with Anna Pavlova and was a leading teacher at the School of American Ballet, died yesterday morning at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Stuart had been in poor health for years, said her son, Peter Warwick.         She came to Pavlova's attention when, at age 8, she answered an advertisement for a class for eight girls to be taught by the Russian ballerina in London. At the audition, Pavlova was fascinated by the way the child moved with the music at a sudden change of rhythm. Miss Stuart's musicality and lyricism were the hallmarks of her style as a dancer with Pavlova, whose company she joined at age 13, and as a teacher at the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet. A Gifted Trainer         Miss Stuart danced with Pavlova until 1926, when she left to marry a violinist, Julian Brodetsky. In 1927 she moved with him to Los Angeles, where she opened a dance school. Except for a brief stint as a first ballerina and choreographer with the Chicago Lyric Opera, she spent the rest of her career teaching, and she become known as a gifted trainer of female dancers.         She was invited to teach at the School of American Ballet in 1935. Since she had recently studied modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg, Martha Graham and Agnes de Mille, she was asked to teach classes in an ill-defined style that was less stringent than ballet but not quite modern dance. "My dear, if I'd sat them on the floor, they'd have died," she once said of her early students.         Though regal in manner, Miss Stuart was known for her waspish but understated wit. "It's either innate or it ain't," a student recalled her saying about rhythm. She could be transfixed by gifted students' dancing, as she was when Allegra Kent, a favorite, entered the school.         Born in a London suburb, South Norwood, Miss Stuart also studied with Enrico Cecchetti. She wrote, with Lincoln Kirstein, "The Classic Ballet: Basic Technique and Terminology," a 1952 book that has become a standard text.         Miss Stuart's first marriage ended in divorce, as did her second marriage, to James Warwick, a playwright. She is survived by her son, who lives in Middletown, N.J.       
         Barbara Dodge Borland, a writer and editor, died on Monday at Sharon (Conn.) Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Salisbury, Conn.         She died of an abdominal aneurysm, said her daughter, Diana Thompson of Cambridge, Mass.         Mrs. Borland wrote two books and collaborated for many years on short stories and novellas with her husband, the nature writer Hal Borland, who died in 1978. In 1962, her book "The Greater Hunger" was published by Appleton-Century Press, and in 1986 "This Is the Way My Garden Grows," was published by W. W. Norton.         She attended Oberlin College, and in the 1930's she ran writing workshops in Manhattan. For several years, she also wrote a gardening column for The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a stepson, Donal Borland of Lithonia, Ga., and two grandchildren.       
         Gwendolen M. Carter, a teacher and writer who was an authority on Africa and one of the founders of African studies in the United States, died yesterday at her home in Orange City, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Dr. Carter died of congestive heart failure, said Judith Bosford, her nurse.         Miss Carter was a professor of political science at Smith College from 1943 to 1964, where she held the Sophia Smith Chair from 1961 to 1964. She also taught at Northwestern University (1964-1974), where she held the title of Melville J. Herskovits Professor of African Affairs; Indiana University (1974-1984) and the University of Florida (1984-1987). She retired in 1987.         Born in Hamilton, Ontario, she became a naturalized American citizen in the early 1940's.         While teaching at Smith College, Dr. Carter decided to examine the major countries of the British Commonwealth.         She recalled later that in 1948 it was "when I first met South Africa." From then on she specialized in African affairs, particularly southern Africa.         Widely respected as an authoritative scholar, Dr. Carter wrote several books including a carefully documented analysis of apartheid, "The Politics of Equality" (1955, Frederick A. Praeger); "Independence for Africa" (1960, Praeger), and "Government and Politics in the Twentieth Century," with John H. Herz (1961, Praeger).         Dr. Carter did not believe that racial conflict was inevitable.         "I don't believe in inevitability," she said in an interview about the political struggle in South Africa. "I'm optimistic. I favor people who are fighting for things. They are going to have a very hard time. But there are magnificent people there, so much good will, so many whites and blacks who are determined to change the situation. It's a mammoth job."         Dr. Carter graduated from the University of Toronto in 1929. She also received a master's degree from Oxford and a doctorate from Radcliffe College.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  February 22, 1991, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Gwendolen Carter, a scholar on Africa, misidentified a book she wrote about apartheid. It was "The Politics of Inequality."       
         Dr. Ruth Landes, an anthropologist who won critical acclaim for her studies of black Brazilians, Indians in North Dakota and Hispanic-Americans in the American Southwest, died on Feb. 11 at her home in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 82 years old.         Dr. Landes's best-known book was "The City of Women," published in 1947 by Macmillan, in which she reported on life around the Brazilian seaport of Bahia, in which women played the dominant roles in a society of descendants of African slaves.         Dr. Landes was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Joseph Schlossberg, a co-founder of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. While attending New York University, where she earned a bachelor's degree, she began a four-year anthropological study of black Jews and of followers of Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement.         She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work and a doctorate from Columbia, under whose auspices she did research among North Dakota's Ojibwa Indians. Her nine published works include studies of other Indian tribes and a treatise on bilingualism and biculturalism in Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Canada and the United States.         Since 1965 Dr. Landes had taught at McMaster University in Hamilton.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Katinka Loeser, many of whose short stories were infused with what a critic described as "autobiographical sketches of warmth and charm," died Wednesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Westport.         She died of kidney failure, said her daughter, Jan DeVries.         Miss Loeser published three collections of stories, most of which first appeared in The New Yorker: "Tomorrow Will Be Monday: Stories of Parents and Children" (1964); "The Archers at Home" (1968), about a suburban couple afflicted with empty-nest syndrome, and "A Thousand Pardons" (1982), stories about a Westport couple who enjoy their lives and the changing seasons.         Miss Loeser was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on July 2, 1913, and grew up in Chicago. She started writing poetry when she was 14. In 1943 she won the Young Poet's Prize of Poetry magazine, and her poems later appeared in The New Yorker. She was notified of the Young Poet's Prize in a telegram from the editor of Poetry, the humorist Peter DeVries, whom she married later that year.         In an interview in 1982, Miss Loeser maintained that it is more difficult to write short stories and poetry than novels. With a poem, she said, "You're thinking in abstract terms and trying to get a rhythm." In a novel, she added, "There is more leeway." But to be a successful writer of any kind, she added, "you have to be a decent reader from the time you're small."         At the University of Chicago, from which she graduated in 1936, Miss Loeser studied under the playwright Thornton Wilder, one of her favorite teachers. When she taught a writing class at the Westport Division of Continuing Education in the 1970's, she adopted the Wilder method of reading his students' stories out loud, anonymously, and having the other students critique them.         Miss Loeser is survived by her husband and three children: Jan DeVries of Media, Pa.; Peter Jon, of New York City, and Derek, of Santa Monica, Calif. Another daughter, Emily, died of leukemia in childhood and is remembered in Miss Loeser's story "Whose Little Girl Are You?" and in Mr. DeVries's book "The Blood of the Lamb."       
         Eleanor King, a modern-dance choreographer and a member of the original Doris Humphrey-Charles Weidman company, died on Wednesday at the Actor's Home in Haddonfield, N.J. She was 85 years old.         Miss King had been in ill health since injuring her hip six weeks ago, a colleague, Mino Nicholas, said.         Miss King danced with Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman, two pioneers of American modern dance, from 1928 to 1935. She also appeared in Leonide Massine's "Sacre du Printemps" at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1930. She began to present programs of her own work during the 1930's, and in 1943 established a company in Seattle. She became known for choreography based on works of literature, from Petrarch to James Joyce.         Her dances were largely unknown to audiences of the 1980's until Annabelle Gamson staged highly praised revivals of her work in 1987 and 88 in New York. The solos were praised in The New York Times for their eloquence and for Miss King's careful shaping of ideas and feelings.  Studied in Japan         Miss King was born in Middletown, Pa. She trained in dance at the Theater Guild School and with Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman. She also studied mime with Etienne Decroux, and in the early 1960's studied dance in Japan. She taught at the University of Arkansas from 1951 to 1971, and then retired, making her home in Santa Fe, N.M.         The revival of her dances renewed interest in Miss King, as did her work with Mr. Nicholas on revivals of her own dances and those of Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman. At the time of her death she was a director of Mr. Nicholas's American Dance Repertory Theater. She wrote the book "Transformations," a memoir of the Humphrey-Weidman era, and was the subject of a 1989 collection of essays, "Eleanor King: 60 Years in American Dance."         Miss King is survived by a brother, John, of Sahuar Rita, Ariz., and a sister, Lucile C. King of Cherry Hill, N.J.       
         Juliette T. Benton, a lecturer on books and plays who headed the Wednesday Book Group in New York for more than half a century, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Mrs. Benton and several other women founded the weekly discussion group in 1932, and she became its head shortly afterward, continuing until it was disbanded in 1987.         She was a freelance lecturer for several decades, organizing reading and discussion groups throughout the New York metropolitan area. She wrote book reviews for The Litchfield County Times in Connecticut until shortly before her death.         Mrs. Benton was born in Darlington, S.C., and was a graduate of Hunter College. She was a founder and board member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.         She is survived by three sons, Dr. Louis J. Scheinman of Seattle, Walt Witcover of Manhattan and Tom Scheinman of Hewlett Bay Park, L.I.; five granddaughters and one great-granddaughter.       
         Nona Balakian, a literary critic, essayist and a former editor on the staff of The New York Times Sunday Book Review, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.         She apparently had a heart attack after a fall, her sister, Anna Nalbantian, said.         An authority on 20th-century European and American literature, Ms. Balakian encouraged such authors as Eudora Welty, Anais Nin, Joyce Carol Oates, Carson McCullers, Reynolds Price, Kurt Vonnegut and others to do work for The Times Sunday Book Review. She also wrote many reviews, review-essays and interviews herself for the Sunday and daily book-review sections of The Times and for literary publications, as well as lecturing on literary topics at a number of universities.         She was co-author, with Charles Simmons, of "The Creative Present" (Doubleday, 1969), a collection of essays on contemporary American fiction. "Critical Encounters" (Bobbs-Merrill), a gathering of her own essays, was published in 1978. A second edition of the book is now in preparation. At her death she was working on a critical study of William Saroyan, for which she had received a Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Award.  On Pulitzer Committees         Ms. Balakian was active in authors' organizations, among them P.E.N. and the Authors Guild. She was a founding member and first secretary of the National Book Critics Circle and she had served on the Pulitzer Prize committees for non-fiction and poetry.         Born in Constantinople, Ms. Balakian came to New York as a child. She graduated from Barnard College and received a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1943.         She joined the staff of The Times Book Review that year, and remained a staff member for 43 years, until she retired in 1987. After that, she continued her affiliation with The Times as a literary consultant.         Besides her sister, Ms. Balakian is survived by six nieces and nephews.         A funeral service will be held tomorrow at noon at St. Vartan's Armenian Cathedral, at 630 Second Avenue at 34th Street.       
         Frauke Petersen Haasemann, the assistant conductor of the Westminster Choir and professor of conducting at the Westminster Choir College, died last Friday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 68 years old.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the college said.         An authority on choral conducting, Miss Haasemann was recently awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Westminster, whose faculty she joined in 1977.         Miss Haasemann was born in Rendsburg, Germany, and studied church music and voice there. She was co-author, with Wilhelm Ehmann, of the book "Voice Building for Choirs," and a co-founder of the Westfaelische Kantorei, a professional choir.         She is survived by three brothers, Klaus, Hans-Jurgen and Jens, all of Germany.       
         Martha Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of this century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Miss Graham died of cardiac arrest after being treated for two months for pneumonia, said Ron Protas, general director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Miss Graham had become ill in December after a 55-day tour of the Far East with her troupe. She entered the hospital on Jan. 15 and returned home two weeks ago.         Frequently ranked with Picasso, Stravinsky and James Joyce for developing a form of expression that broke the traditional mold, Miss Graham was initially acclaimed as a great dancer. Masterworks and Invention         Yet ultimately her genius -- universally recognized as she became the most honored figure in American dance -- was embodied in her choreographic masterworks and her invention of a new and codified dance language.         The Graham technique, which is now used by dance companies throughout the world, became the first enduring alternative to the idiom of classical ballet. Powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension, this vocabulary combined with Miss Graham's distinctive system of training to set her above other dance innovators.         Although such achievements were part of Miss Graham's multi-faceted pioneering role in helping to establish modern dance outside the older ballet tradition after the 1920's, she continued to amaze her public for more than 60 years. She choreographed more than 180 works. The most recent was her self-mocking "Maple Leaf Rag," which had its premiere on Oct. 2 with the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.         Throughout her career, Miss Graham's fundamental tenet was that dance should reach audiences through a visceral response rather than an objective image that registered upon the intellect. "Out of emotion comes form," she said, and then proved that out of form she could re-create the same emotion onstage.         She never wavered in her belief that movement could express inner feeling. Miss Graham sought to give "visible substance to things felt" and to "chart the graph of the heart." These celebrated Graham phrases became the metaphors central to her art.         Miss Graham's dances spoke elo- quently against the crushing of the human spirit, and one of her frequent themes was the condemnation of intolerance, especially toward nonconformists.         Her own life as a creative artist epitomized the independent spirit with which she so frequently imbued her dramatic heroines. The figure conquering sexual fear in "Errand Into the Maze," the woman looking deep into herself while preparing for an unnamed fate in "Herodiade" and the American pioneer brimming with optimism in "Frontier" could also be Clytemnestra or Jocasta, antiquity's queens who -- in the Graham canon -- emerged from crisis through the sheer force of self-understanding. Miss Graham usually cast herself at the center of these works until 1969, when she gave her last performance and retired reluctantly from the stage at the age of 75.         Because she rarely met conventional expectations about dance, she was both misunderstood and acclaimed. She was surrounded by debate throughout her career; few remained indifferent to her. Acknowledgment of Miss Graham's role as a dominant force in all the arts at first came from painters, writers, musicians and the acting profession. Gregory Peck and Bette Davis were among the many drama students she taught over the years at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Graham to perform at the White House in 1937, and in 1976 Miss Graham became the first dance personality to receive, from President Gerald R. Ford, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.         Nonetheless, Miss Graham's highly intense dancing and choreography were not intended to soothe the spirit and did not find ready acceptance. Quest for Inner Reality, But Never for Realism         Like Picasso, she was concerned with an inner reality. "For me, dance is theater," she wrote. But she never resorted to a realistic theater. More often than not, her choreography presented a dancer's body as distorted or dislocated, an assemblage of forms aligned into maximum expressiveness.         Audiences throughout the world were often disturbed by Miss Graham's frank acknowledgment of human sexuality, especially in her famous cycle inspired by Greek myths. Miss Graham's Medea, Jocasta, Phaedra and Clytemnestra gave vent to their lust and hate, baring the passions that few humans liked to recognize in themselves but that Miss Graham exposed with the unflinching scrutiny of a 20th-century Jungian analyst.         For Miss Graham, dance became a collective memory that could communicate the emotions universal to all civilizations: mythology, she felt, was the psychology of the ancients.         Miss Graham's encyclopedic approach to dance -- a creative wellspring from sources as varied as American Indian rituals to the Bible -- often carried several levels of meaning and startled a public that defined dance in linear or pictorial terms. Miss Graham, for her part, said she wanted her dances to be "felt" rather than comprehended in the usual manner.         In 1944, John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote of the emotional effect that the Graham dance theater could have upon the viewer. He warned that "Deaths and Entrances," the choreographer's study of turbulent passions inspired by Anne, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, the 19th-century English writers, was "un-understandable through the usual organs of understanding" and "slips in through sensory perceptions." The Graham Technique Is Based on Breathing         In general, Miss Graham saw art as a reflection of its time inseparable from life. "My dancing," she said, "is not an attempt to interpret life in the literary sense. It is an affirmation of life through movement."         Even the dance technique that she hammered out on her own body and then transferred to her school and company derived from the most organic aspect of human life: the act of breathing. That act was formalized and dramatized in the idiom's most basic principle, called contraction and release -- intensified moments of exhalation and inhalation. Miss Graham said her aim was "to increase the emotional activity of the dancer's body so that you are teaching the body, not teaching the mind."         The contraction, originating in the dancer's pelvis, created the percussive angular movement and sexual tension that invariably startled a newcomer to the Graham repertory. But it is the Graham idiom as a whole that can look strange to those who expect more of a continuum in dancing. Being 'the Thing Itself' Instead of Portraying It         Above all, she said, "Dance is not representational." Miss Graham recalled in later years that as a young dancer about to embark upon an independent career in 1922, she had chanced upon a nonfigurative painting by Wassily Kandinsky -- a slash of red against a field of blue. "I will dance like that," she said.         Like other modernists, Miss Graham rejected literal imagery in favor of abstraction. Form for form's sake, however, held no interest for her. Instead she focused on abstraction in its strict sense, that of extracting the essence of a quality of emotion. A celebrated example was "Lamentation," the 1930 solo in which Miss Graham, encased in a tube of stretch jersey, created sharply angular shapes on a bench. She did not dance about grief, but sought to be what she called "the thing itself" or the embodiment of grief.         Miss Graham's gift for the distilled image ranged over her entire career. In "Cave of the Heart" (1946), her Medea was the personification of hate, consumed by the venom of jealousy as visualized in snakelike contours.         The quintessential Graham could be found in "Frontier" (1935), one of the choreographer's pieces on overt American themes. The solo initiated her 32-year collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.         The set for "Frontier" was a fragment of a fence seemingly anchored by a rope behind. It had the same spareness and economy of Miss Graham's solo and the score of her music director and mentor of that time, Louis Horst. Noguchi noted in general that he had found in Miss Graham "a drive that motivated her to strip the dance to its stark rudiment." Noguchi's Sets Sought 'A Limitless Illusion'         Both artists shared an affinity for forms that looked abstract and were resonant with multiple meanings. Writing in 1984, Noguchi said that for "Frontier" he had "thought to catch the essential sculpture of space -- a limitless illusion." He continued: "This is the path I continued to investigate whenever Martha would call on me to rise to the occasion. She is the one who always came to me with her requirements and the myth she wished to encompass. My role was to respond."         Miss Graham's work revealed an integrated vision. She began using contemporary scores for the company she formed in 1929. After 1934, she tended to use commissioned music and was guided here by Horst, a composer who insisted that dance had a life independent of music and did not derive from it. Miss Graham herself, sometimes accused of using dance as mere aural decor, often said that she did not seek to interpret another art form -- that is, music.         Among the composers who wrote scores for Miss Graham were Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Aaron Copland, whose score for her 1944 classic, "Appalachian Spring," won the Pulitzer Prize.         Martha Graham, the eldest of three daughters, was born on May 11, 1894, in Allegheny, Pa., to George Graham, a physician who specialized in mental disorders, and the former Jane (Jenny) Beers, a descendant of Miles Standish. In 1908, the family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif. Started Dance Training At 22, After Father Died         In 1916, after the death of her father and after graduation from a junior college, the Cumnock School, Miss Graham enrolled in the Denishawn school in Los Angeles and then joined the Denishawn Company. Denishawn, organized by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, was then the only major dance company that worked outside the classical ballet tradition, and it became the incubating ground for such pioneering talents as Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Miss Graham herself.         John Murray Anderson saw Miss Graham with Denishawn and hired her for his Greenwich Village Follies in 1923 and 1924. But in those two years Miss Graham realized that neither Denishawn, with its exotic pretexts for dances, nor the commercial theater was right for her. At the invitation of Rouben Mamoulian, she joined the dance division of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she taught dance.         On April 18, 1926, she made her concert debut at the 48th Street Theater in New York with works that still showed the influence of Denishawn. "The idiom," the critic Robert Sabin recalled in 1953, "was still prevalently romantic and eclectic, but the spirit was new and as bracing as a salty sea wind."         Miss Graham taught in the early years in her studio at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 13th Street, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She assembled a company of women. Because the members had to support themselves, they would work on new works for nine months, then give a few recitals in New York and go on tour.         From her group, augmented by men in 1938 to 1939, came the next generation of modern dancers, choreographers and teachers: Anna Sokolow, Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, May O'Donnell, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham and later Paul Taylor and John Butler. Miss Graham, who had a long-term relationship with Horst, was married in 1948 to Mr. Hawkins. They separated in the early 1950's and were later divorced. Received Financial Help From Many Individuals         Before World War II, Miss Graham took on outside assignments. In 1930, she was the Chosen One in Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski and choreographed by Leonide Massine. A few years later she collaborated on dramatic productions with Blanche Yurka, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, and Archibald MacLeish.         Troubled by the recurring financial problems that were endemic to an art form struggling for acceptance, Miss Graham was helped over the years by individual patrons. Among them were Frances Steloff, founder of the Gotham Book Mart, whose $1,000 loan made the initial 1926 concert possible, Miss Cornell, Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace and, most recently, Halston. Mrs. Wallace made it possible for the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance to acquire the building at 316 East 63d Street, where the Graham school is situated.         In the early years, Miss Graham costumed herself and the women in her troupe in stretch jersey. She later referred to this time as her "long woolens" period. Her dances were spare and stark, testimony to her deep interest in ritual, and she was strongly influenced by the ceremonial Indian dances she had witnessed in the Southwest. These experiences were reflected in such works as "Primitive Mysteries" and "El Penitente," which remain in her company's repertory. From American Themes To Ancient Mythology         In the 1930's, Miss Graham was known for her American themes. "We must look to America to bring forth an art as powerful as America itself," she said, and produced such works as "American Document," "American Provincials," "Appalachian Spring," "Letter to the World" and "Salem Shore."         After 1946, she immersed herself in Hebrew and Greek mythology with "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey," "Errand Into the Maze," "Judith," "The Witch of Endor," "Phaedra" and, most powerfully, the full-evening "Clytemnestra" of 1958. She picked up historical personages with legendary qualities, the Bronte sisters for "Deaths and Entrances" and Joan of Arc for "Seraphic Dialogue."         As the years progressed, Miss Graham was loath to leave the stage. Since she was the central figure on that stage, she eventually began to create roles for herself that were less physically demanding. After her retirement from dancing, her new works rarely focused on a protagonist.         Repeatedly acclaimed as a choreographer, she always considered herself a dancer first. After relinquishing her roles to younger dancers, she continued to direct her company. She made triumphant tours to the Far East and Europe under Government auspices and, in her 80's and 90's, increasingly traveled abroad with her company. Her tour last fall took in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Congressional Propriety Offended by 'Phaedra'         It was on a European trip in 1962 that she ran afoul of two United States Representatives, Edna Kelly of Brooklyn and Peter Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. They saw "Phaedra" in Bonn and, apparently not knowing the Greek legend of a queen's passion for her stepson, protested that the work was too explicit to be a proper cultural export for the United States.         Although Miss Graham was identified with a new art form that initially rejected classical ballet as being inadequate for contemporary expression, she collaborated with ballet's leading personalities.         In 1959, the New York City Ballet presented "Episodes," consisting of two sections to Webern's music. George Balanchine choreographed one half and Miss Graham the other. In 1975, just before Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev appeared as guests in her company, she declared, "The war has ended," alluding to the perceived conflict between modern dance and ballet. Further proof came when Mikhail Baryshnikov appeared as a guest with her troupe from 1987 to 1989.         Among Miss Graham's awards were the first Guggenheim Fellowship given to a dancer; the Kennedy Center Honors; the Aspen Award in the Humanities; the Capezio Dance Award; the first Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award to honor achievement in modern dance; the Meadows Award in the performing arts; the Handel Medallion of New York City; the Henry Hadley medal for contribution to American music, and the first National Medal of Arts.         In 1987, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave Miss Graham the Ingenio et Arti medal, a rarely awarded honor and her country's highest distinction for contributions to the arts and sciences. Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, personally decorated her in 1984 with the Legion of Honor at the Paris Opera. She received a number of honorary degrees, from Yale, Harvard and other universities.         Miss Graham liked to emphasize that her work and private life were separate. "I have always fought against any dramatization of my peculiarities or my personality," she said. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Lask noted it was through her work "that she had, in William Faulkner's apt phrase, put a scratch on the face of eternity."         Martha Graham was living proof of her own adage: "No artist is ahead of his time. He         is         his time; it is just that others are behind the time."         Miss Graham leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Coral Lansbury, an author, Victorian scholar and dean of the Graduate School of English at Rutgers University's Camden campus, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 61 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lansbury, who had written a number of scholarly literary works, began writing fiction late in her career when her cousin, the actress Angela Lansbury, said to her seven years ago, "Darling, are you going to go on all your life writing those dreary academic books that nobody reads?"         The result was "Sweet Alice," which E. P. Dutton brought out in 1986 and which Publishers Weekly praised as a "slightly naughty tale of greed, goodness and British breeding." Her second novel, "Ringarra," a Gothic tale, reached readers in 1985, even before "Sweet Alice" appeared. 'Mythic Quality' to Writing         In quick succession there followed "Felicity" (1987) a farce, and "The Grotto" (1989), whose writing was praised by John Mortimer in The New York Times Book Review for its "energy, good humor and mythic quality." Alfred A. Knopf will publish her fifth novel, "Opium!," next year.         Ms. Lansbury was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1929 to British parents who were touring in a production of the musical "Showboat." The family was stranded by the Great Depression and Ms. Lansbury graduated from North Sydney Girls High School, a selective institution, and entered the University of Sydney at age 15.         A year later her father, who had become a sound-effects man in the country's fledgling radio industry, got her a part in a drama on the air. She worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation into the 1960's but as television supplanted radio drama she turned more to academic interests, publishing articles and lecturing widely.         Ms. Lansbury came to the United States and joined the Rutgers faculty at Camden in 1974. She wrote four books on Anthony Trollope and other Victorian literary figures between 1975 and 1984. She served as president of the Victorian Studies Association and of the Victorian executive committee of the Modern Language Association.         She is survived by a son, Malcolm Turnbull of Sydney, and two grandchildren.       
         Marie Jastrow, who wrote two critically praised books describing immigrant life in turn-of-the-century New York, died at her home in Tucson, Ariz., on March 30. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Jastrow was 82 when her first book, "A Time to Remember: Growing Up in New York Before the Great War," was published in 1979 by W. W. Norton. It was followed in 1986 by a sequel, also published by Norton, "Looking Back: The American Dream Through Immigrant Eyes 1907-1918."         Reviewing "A Time to Remember" in The New York Times Book Review, Caroline Seebohm wrote: "This kind of document grows more and more precious with the years. Her vivid descriptions evoke more than just a lost age -- they evoke a certain feeling for America that cannot quite be duplicated."         Mrs. Jastrow was born in the Prussian city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. She lived in Yugoslavia before moving to the United States with her family in 1907, at the age of 10. They settled in the Yorkville area of Manhattan.         In a 1979 interview Mrs. Jastrow recalled: "We enjoyed Yorkville when it was a melting pot for immigrants from all over Europe. It was a wonderful time. People were poor in money, but no one felt poor otherwise.         "We lived on East 81st Street. Fleischmann's Vienna Bakery was next door. It was managed by Raoul Fleischmann, who later became the publisher of The New Yorker. P.S. 96 was across the street."         Mrs. Jastrow said she had been writing since she was a young girl, but had always received rejection slips. "I concentrated on short stories, which I must say are very good," she said.         She is survived by her son, Robert, an astonomer, author and professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College; a daughter, Dorothy Heller of Creston, N.C., and a sister, Yolanda Pesce, of Tucson.       
         Jane Cooper Bland, a teacher of art and art appreciation to young children, died on Friday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had an apartment in Greenwich Village.         Mrs. Bland died of heart failure after suffering complications following heart surgery, her family said.         In 1951, while she was with the Museum of Modern Art, Mrs. Bland wrote in The New York Times that it was important "for us art teachers to provide the opportunity for children to express their ideas and feelings with confidence that they will be accepted and respected."         Her work at the museum included holding classes for children and also providing instruction for other teachers.         The other institutions where she taught in New York over the years included the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools. She also held workshops around the country.         Mrs. Bland was born in Boston, grew up in New York, studied at Pratt Institute and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University Teachers College.         Her writings included the book "The Art of Young Children."         Mrs. Bland was the widow of Harry McNeil Bland, an art dealer who died in 1960.         She is survived by a son, John Cooper Bland of Conshohocken, Pa.; five grandchidren and five great-grandchildren.

         Ilse Koehn, a writer and graphic artist, died on May 8 at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 61 years old.         Ms. Koehn died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.         She moved to New York City from West Berlin in 1958 and worked as an art director for the J. Walter Thompson and Campbell-Downe advertising agencies. After she moved to Greenwich in 1970, she and her husband, John Van Zwienen, worked together as writers, illustrators and graphic designers. The couple later divorced.         Ms. Koehn's first book, "Mischling, Second Degree," described her experiences as a child of part-Jewish parentage growing up in Berlin under the Nazis and in evacuation camps during World War II.  The book was published in six countries outside the United States, including Britain, France and West Germany. It received the Boston Globe Hornbook Award, the Jane Addams Peace Foundation Award for nonfiction and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award as a book recommended for young readers.         Ms. Koehn was a member of the Graphic Artists Guild and the Authors Guild.         She is survived by a stepdaughter, Kyle Van Zwienen of Webster, Mass.       
         Edwina Booth, an actress who made headlines in the 1930's when a mysterious illness ended her film career, died Saturday. She was 86 years old.         Miss Booth, whose death had been erroneously reported several times since she contracted an illness while filming "Trader Horn" in Africa, died in the Medallion Convalescent Hospital in Long Beach, her brother, Booth Woodruff, said.         "Her death has been wrongly reported so many times, including recently in the book 'The Making of the African Queen' by Katharine Hepburn," Mr. Woodruff said. "But this time she really did die."         Miss Booth appeared in the films "Manhattan Cocktail" in 1928, "Our Modern Maidens" in 1929, and serials like "The Vanishing Legion" and "The Last of the Mohicans." But it was her role in "Trader Horn" and her subsequent illness that made headlines. Silent Became a Talkie         The film, a melodrama about the so-called "white goddess" of an African tribe, began as a silent picture but ended as one of Hollywood's new "talkies." The cast and film crew had to mark time in Africa for several weeks waiting for the new sound equipment to arrive.         After release of the film in 1931, Miss Booth became ill and was confined to bed for more than five years. She sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for more than $1 million, claiming that the studio had failed to safeguard her health in Africa while the movie was being made. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Miss Booth never made another movie.         Miss Booth's husband, Reinhold Fehlberg, died in 1984.         In addition to her brother, Miss Booth is survived by a sister, Betty Benson, and two stepdaughters, Judy Larson and Dixie Nelson.       
         Letitia Grierson, an educator and freelance editor, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said her son, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the Bronx.         Mrs. Grierson, who was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, came to the United States in the early 1930's and taught English at colleges and private schools in the metropolitan area. After her retirement in 1965, she became a free-lance editor and reviewed books for newspapers.         Her marriage to Helmut Lehmann-Haupt ended in divorce in 1947.         In addition to her son Christopher, book critic for The New York Times, she is survived by two other sons, Carl, a graphic artist and painter, and Alexander, a sound engineer, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Pam Martin Sarnoff, an author and a volunteer in charitable causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of colon cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Sarnoff wrote "The Ultimate Spa Book" (Warner Books, 1990), as well as articles for travel magazines.         She was a co-chairwoman of the Winter Antiques Show, held at the Seventh Regiment Armory at Park Avenue and 67th Street, from the mid-1970's until her death. She was a board member of the East Side Settlement House and the New York City Opera Guild and chairwoman of the benefit for the American Foundation for AIDS Research. She was also a literacy volunteer.         She is survived by her husband, William, chairman of Time Warner Trade Publishing; two sons, Jeffrey and Richard, both of Manhattan, and a daughter, Nancy, also of Manhattan.       
         Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.         For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.         In 1946, she became a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald, now defunct. She wrote a sociey column, "Under My Hat," and later wrote a syndicated column, "From the Capital." She was also a commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System.         She and William Randolph Hearst Jr., chairman of the Hearst Corporation, were married in 1948. Her first marriage, to Igor Cassini, the designer, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Hearst, who left the newspaper business in 1956, wrote "The Horses of San Simeon," (San Simeon Press, 1985), a book about breeding and raising horses.         She was a graduate of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in Baltimore.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, William Randolph Hearst 3d, publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, and Austin, of Manhattan, vice president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, a division of the Hearst Corporation, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Correction:  June 25, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter whose husband is the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, misstated the occupation of her first husband, Igor Cassini. He was a newspaper columnist. (Oleg Cassini, the designer, is Igor Cassini's brother.)       
         Margot Tomes, an artist and illustrator of children's books, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pancreatic cancer, a family friend said.         Miss Tomes was an award-winning illustrator of fairy tales, historical stories in verse for children, songbooks and cookbooks. She illustrated works by Alison Lurie, Jean Fritz, Wanda Gag, Ruth Kraus and Charlotte Zolotow, among others.         The American Library Association listed her work among notable books for children, and the American Institute of Graphic Arts included her work in a 1978-79 exhibition entitled "Communicating With Children." In 1977, "Jack and the Wonder Beans," a book she illustrated, was cited by The New York Times as one of the 10 best children's books of the year. A similar citation was given in 1984 for "If There Were Dreams to Sell."         Miss Tomes began illustrating children's books in 1963 with Barbera Wersba's book "The Brave Balloon of Benjamin Buckley." Most recently she had been illustrating fairy tales like "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," "The Six Swans" and "The Fisherman and His Wife."         She is survived by a sister, Jacqueline Allison of Amagansett, L.I.       
         Eva Le Gallienne, who as an actress, producer, director, translator, writer and teacher was for many decades one of the grand figures of the American stage, died late Monday night at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 92 years old.         The cause of death was heart failure, said a friend, Anne Kaufman Schneider.         A commanding presence on the stage and a strong-minded director, Miss Le Gallienne was actually a slight and, according to her friends, a shy and private person, her affections being concentrated on her dogs and other pets. In a memoir, she expressed surprise at being called beautiful by critics; she said she thought beauty might be a burden.         She was dedicated to the theater from early childhood, two aunts and an uncle having been successful English actors. She was born in London on Jan. 11, 1899, the daughter of Richard Le Gallienne, a then-famous poet and journalist, and the former Julie Norregard, a Danish journalist. Her parents were divorced when Eva was 4 years old, and she and her mother moved to Paris. Saw Bernhardt Act         There, as a young girl, she saw Sarah Bernhardt act, and was taken backstage to meet the star. The experience was to determine the course of Miss Le Gallienne's own life.         "It made such an enormous impression on me that I thought, 'That's what I'd like to do,' " she said.         Eva was 15 when Constance Collier, a family friend, got her a walk-on role in Maeterlinck's "Monna Vanna" in London. She attended a drama school for a few months, but left for a part as a cockney servant girl in a minor comedy -- and brought down the house.         On the strength of rave reviews and encouragement from theater folk, Miss Le Gallienne and her mother left wartime London in 1915 for New York. Her bright expectations were not immediately realized. The first two plays in which she found work were failures, and she was dismissed from the cast of another play during its out-of-town tryouts. She spent a season on the road and in summer stock.  First Success         Finally, at the age of 20, she enjoyed her first big success, opposite Sidney Blackmer in Arthur Richman's "Not So Long Ago." This was followed by a still greater hit in 1921 with Joseph Schildkraut in the Theater Guild's production of Molnar's "Liliom."         In 1923, she had another hit in the star role in "The Swan" by Molnar. During its long run in 1923 and again in 1924-25, she became obsessed with the need for a repertory theater.         "Miss Le G.," as generations of theater people called her, came closer than any other person to endowing the United States with a permanent company performing repertory in the manner of the Old Vic, the Comedie Francaise and the Moscow Art Theater.         Without any government subsidy, she very nearly realized her dream. Willingly abandoning a career as a Broadway star in 1926, she founded the Civic Repertory Theater and staged classics at popular prices that filled the old 14th Street Theater for six seasons.         The Civic Rep's production of "Peter Pan," with the actress sailing to the balcony on an invisible wire, enchanted masses of children, and Josephine Hutchinson as "Alice in Wonderland" with Miss Le Gallienne as the White Queen enchanted grownups as well.         Among the company's apprentices were such hopeful novices as Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, J. Edward Bromberg and Howard Da Silva.         But although the Civic Repertory played in the main to full houses, the box office, with a top ticket price of $1.50, never quite met its budget. The company's wealthy patrons were hit by the Depression, donations dwindled and the theater closed in 1933. By then it had given 1,581 performances of 34 plays -- 32 of which Miss Le Gallienne had directed. She also acted in a majority of the plays.         At the end of the 1930-31 season, Miss Le Gallienne was severely burned in the explosion of a gasoline stove at her country home in Weston. The use of her hands was only partly restored in a series of operations, but she so mastered the handicap that few in her audiences perceived it.         After a series of operations on her crippled hands, she directed and starred on Broadway in Rostand's "L'Aiglon" with Ethel Barrymore.  'Rather Play Ibsen Than Eat'         After its long run, Miss Le Gallienne performed the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" in vaudeville, and translated, staged and acted in Ibsen's "Rosmersholm." It failed, using up her financial reserves. Long afterward, she wrote, "I would rather play Ibsen than eat -- and that's often just what it amounts to."         With her longtime companion, the late actress Marion Evensen, she moved to the estate at Weston, which she had bought at a prosperous time in 1926. There, with barnyard and forest creatures, cats and a kennel of cairn terriers, she busily gardened, wove, wrote and studied for the rest of her life -- but never abandoned the theater.         She lectured at colleges, toured frequently in plays and realized a youthful ambition by playing "Hamlet," in a summer production that she staged with the young Uta Hagen as Ophelia. For the Theater Guild, she directed a series of revivals at popular prices.         During the war years, the actress also toured for the Guild as Mrs. Malaprop in "The Rivals" and returned to Broadway as a star opposite Joseph Schildkraut in two successes: "Uncle Harry" by Thomas Job and a new "Cherry Orchard." She had also produced the play and helped to translate it.         With Margaret Webster and Cheryl Crawford, Miss Le Gallienne helped organize the American Repertory Theater in 1946, but the reviews were mixed, the costs were high and the three leaders did not always agree. The first season was the last.         In 1958, her television production of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey" was described by Jack Gould, the New York Times critic, as "unforgettable" and her part as "acting at its supreme best." Played Queen Elizabeth         Another memorable role was her performance as Queen Elizabeth in Schiller's "Mary Stuart," which she did on stage across the country periodically from 1957 through 1962, and also on television.         As translator, director and a star of Chekhov's "Seagull" in 1964, Miss Le Gallienne received from Adlai E. Stevenson the award of the American National Theater and Academy. She got another ANTA award on her 78th birthday in 1977.         She was then on tour, in "The Royal Family." The revival of the Edna Ferber-George S. Kaufman comedy based on the Barrymore family was a hit of the 1976 Broadway season and a triumph for Miss Le Gallienne, who played the mother of the tribe, skipping girlishly upstairs in Act I and descending like an elderly queen in Act III.         As a result of her work in "The Royal Family," she received New York City's cultural award, the Handel Medallion, and the observation by the actress Rosemary Harris:         "If you listen to Miss Le G., you can hear 15 shades of meaning in 15 syllables."         In 1981 Miss Le Gallienne returned to Broadway in "To Grandmother's House We Go," which ran for only 61 performances. Returned as White Queen         But her enthusiasm for her next Broadway project was boundless, since it involved her co-directing a late 1982 revival of her beloved "Alice in Wonderland" and again assuming the role of the White Queen. It, too, however, was a flop, closing after 21 regular performances.         In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Arts.         Miss Le Gallienne traveled everywhere for many years with a two-pound Yorkshire terrier, Nana, in a little basket.         After observing two barnyard hens, she wrote a children's book, "Flossie and Bossie: A Moral Tale." She also translated "Seven Tales by Hans Christian Andersen" and wrote a bio graphy, "The Mystic in the Theater: Eleonora Duse" (1966).         Stagestruck to the end, she once recalled a young woman complaining that she had never seen Sarah Bernhardt, Sacha Guitry, Isadora Duncan or Duse. "I thought to myself," Miss Le Gallienne said, " 'I wouldn't change places with you for anything; not even to be 20 again!' "         There are no survivors.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Margaret L. Suckley, an aide and confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and an archivist at the nation's first Presidential Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., died on Saturday at Wilderstein, her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 99 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Miss Suckley, who was known as Daisy, was a distant cousin and close neighbor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and lived her entire life in the landmark house overlooking the Hudson River near Hyde Park built by her grandfather in 1852.         In 1940, Miss Suckley, who raised Scottish terriers, gave the President a puppy he named Fala. The dog soon became the country's most photographed animal. Miss Suckley was the co-author of a children's book about Fala and took part in producing two short films depicting the dog's life in the limelight. Center of Political Uproar         Fala became the center of a political uproar in the 1944 Presidential campaign, when Republicans charged that the Navy had sent a warship to rescue the dog after he had been left behind during a visit by President Roosevelt to the Aleutian Islands. The President turned the story to his advantage by expressing mock indignation that his Republican adversaries would attack "even my little dog Fala."         Miss Suckley was largely invisible to the general public although she traveled with the President on wartime inspection trips and to meetings with heads of state and allied military leaders. She was at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga., when President Roosevelt suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945.         She continued on the staff of the Roosevelt Library until she retired in 1963. She often spoke about the Roosevelt Presidency from her privileged station close to the family but was unassuming and meticulously factual and circumspect in her recollections. Nurse's Aide During War         Miss Suckley was born at Wilderstein and was a descendant of several prominent American families of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Livingstons and Beekmans. She attended Bryn Mawr and during World War I served as a nurse's aide at a military hospital on Ellis Island.         In 1980, she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation, dedicated to the maintenance and public enjoyment of her 45-acre riverfront property whose grounds were designed by Calvert Vaux, the noted 19th century park architect, and whose Queen Anne interiors were the work of J. B. Tiffany. Last year Wilderstein received National Historic Landmark status.         Miss Suckley, the last of seven brothers and sisters, is survived by two nieces, Margaret Hendrick of Annapolis, Md., and Catherine Hambley of Rhinebeck.       
         Patricia Robbins Beatty, an award-winning author of 50 children's books, died on Tuesday at the Riverside (Calif.) Community Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in Riverside.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Beatty's books were generally admired for their evocation of both the humor and the harsh realities of the American West in the 19th century. Her more recent novels, including "Charley Skedaddle" (1987), which won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, dealt with the Civil War.         She was born in Portland, Ore., and spent much of her childhood in the Northwest, sometimes living on Indian reservations. She graduated from Reed College in Portland and became a children's librarian and a high school teacher of English and history.         She began to write when her children were small and drew on her knowledge of the Quileute Indians for her first book, "The Indian Canoe Maker," published in 1960 by Caxton Press. Eleven books that followed were written in collaboration with her first husband, Dr. John L. Beatty, a professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, who died in 1975.         In 1974, she received an award for a distinguished body of work from the Southern California Council on Children's Literature. In 1988, she established the John and Patricia Beatty Award through the California Library Association to encourage the writing of children's books about the culture and heritage of California.         A forthcoming book, "Jayhawker," the story of a young abolitionist during the Civil War, is to be published by Morrow Junior Books in October.         She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Carl Uhr, a professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside; a daughter, Alexandra Beatty, and two grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Regis Sullivan, the editor in chief of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine since 1982, died on Friday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her brother George Sullivan of Belmont, Mass., said.         She was the managing editor of the monthly mystery magazine from 1970 to 1982 while also serving as editor in chief of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine from 1975 to 1981.         She edited many anthologies of mysteries and wrote articles for newspapers, magazines and books, at times under such pen names as Lika Van Ness, Julia DeHahn and Ruth Graviros. She wrote a 1984 book, "Whodunit: a Biblio-Bio-Anecdotal Memoir of Federic Dannay," profiling the writer who, with a cousin, collaborated under the pseudonym Ellery Queen.         She was also the secretary and a board member of the Mystery Writers of America, and won the group's 1987 Ellery Queen Award for Excellence.         She was a native of Cambridge, Mass., and a graduate of Salem State College. She taught for a decade in elementary schools in Clinton, Conn., Cambridge and White Plains. For five years, she helped veterans of the Vietnam War at St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by another brother, James, of Darien, Conn., and three sisters, Mary Ford, Catherine Collins and Anne Powers, all of the Boston area.       
         Sylvia Scribner, a psychologist on the faculty of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Scribner died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Dr. Scribner's research centered on cultural influences on learning and development. One of her best-known projects involved studying the literacy of the Vai people of western Liberia, who invented an original writing system. She detailed her research in a book, "The Psychology of Literacy," for which she received the Melville J. Herskovitz Award from the African Studies Association in 1982.         Before joining the faculty of the CUNY Graduate School in 1981, Dr. Scribner was a research scientist at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington and, from 1978 to 1979, was associate director of the National Institute of Education. From 1970 to 1978 she was senior research associate at Rockefeller University.         She graduated from Smith College in 1944 and earned a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in 1970. She began her career as research director for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America in Newark.         Her husband, David Scribner, a lawyer, died in April.         She is survived by a son, Oliver, of Vancouver, B.C.; a daughter, Aggie Kapelman of Manhattan; three step-daughters, Toni Scribner of St. James, N.Y., Wendy Scribner of Manhattan and Nancy Jaslow of Abington, Pa., and two grandsons.       
         Edythe Lutzker, a historian and author who went to college at age 46, died on Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from lung congestion, her son Michael said.         Mrs. Lutzker wrote a book on the first group of women to get M.D. degrees in England in the 19th century, "Women Gain a Place in Medicine," in 1969. She also wrote a biography of one of them, "Edith Pechey-Phipson, M.D.: The Story of England and India's Foremost Pioneering Woman Doctor."         More recently, Mrs. Lutzker, with Carol Jochnowitz, wrote a biography of Waldemar M. Haffkine, a bacteriologist who discovered vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague.         In 1950, when Mrs. Lutzker was 46, she enrolled in City College. "All my life I've had to postpone going to college," she said. "The problems that arise when a working woman brings up children forced me to put it off." She graduated in 1954 in the college's first arts and science class that included women.         She received her master's degree from Columbia University in 1959.         Mrs. Lutzker is survived by three sons, Michael, of New York City; Arthur, of Oakhurst, N.J., and Paul, of Washington; two brothers, David Levine of Margate, Fla., and Robert Levine of New York City; a sister, Miriam Gindin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Miss Southern's recordings include "You Better Go Now," "When I Fall in Love," "An Occasional Man" and "Fire Down Below," which she sang in the Rita Hayworth film of the same name in 1957. That song made it to the top-10 spot on the pop-music charts.         Miss Southern, whose name was originally Genevieve Hering, was born in Royal, Neb. She began playing the piano as a child, and she trained as a classical pianist. She moved to Chicago in the mid-1940's. To support herself, she worked as a cocktail pianist, and built a reputation as a pop singer. She was signed by Decca Records, which released her first single in 1951.         In the late 1960's, Miss Southern stopped performing publicly and began teaching vocal and piano technique to others in the profession. She continued to write and arrange songs, and published a book, "Interpreting Popular Music at the Keyboard."         Miss Southern had been divorced for more than 10 years from the jazz musician Bill Holman, but she continued to use that last name privately. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Anne Marie Jauss, an author of books for children and an illustrator, died on Friday at a nursing home in Milford, N.J. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes, said a friend, Florence Stephens.         Ms. Jauss was born in Munich, Germany, and studied at the state art school in Berlin. She left Germany in 1942 and moved to Lisbon, making a living as a painter, an illustrator and a pottery-maker. In 1946, she moved to the United States and began a career as a writer of children's books.         Her best-known book is "Under a Green Roof" which was published in 1960 by J.B. Lippincott of Philadelphia and New York in 1960.         She is survived by one nephew.       
         Julie Bovasso, an actress and playwright in the avant-garde theater Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway, died Saturday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Bovasso died of cancer, said her literary agent, Helen Harvey.         In the mid-1950's, Ms. Bovasso established the experimental Tempo Playhouse on St. Marks Place in Manhattan and introduced works of the Theater of the Absurd, including those of the playwrights Jean Genet, Eugene Ionesco and Michel de Ghelderode, to the professional theater in the United States. In the New York premiere of "The Maids" by Genet, she won an Obie Award as best Off Broadway actress in 1956.         Ms. Bovasso also won Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards in 1972 as best actress for her performance in "The Screens" by Genet. 3 Obies in the Same Year         In 1970, she won three Obies, as best playwright, director and actress, for "Gloria and Esperanza," which opened at Cafe La Mama. When the work moved to the ANTA Theater on Broadway, Clive Barnes wrote in The New York Times that "it represents La Mama both at its most adventurous and at its most self-indulgent."         The writer Arthur Sainer, in the book "Contemporary Dramatists," described Ms. Bovasso as "a kind of mad mathematician, marshalling people and events into lunatic propositions and hallucinatory equations." Her other plays include "The Moon Dreamers," "Schubert's Last Serenade," "Monday on the Way to Mercury Island," "The Nothing Kid" and "Angelo's Wedding." Turbulent Productions         In 1973, Ms. Bovasso was hired to direct "In the Boom Boom Room" by David Rabe, the first production of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. But she was replaced a few days before the play opened, and Mr. Papp became the director.         When "Angelo's Wedding" was presented by the Circle Repertory Company in 1985, several weeks of difficult relations among the playwright, the director and several cast members culminated in an altercation at the theater during a performance.         Marshall W. Mason, the theater's artistic director, said at the time that Ms. Bovasso attacked an intern and a house manager who had tried to evict her from the theater for disturbing the cast. At the beginning of Act III, Mr. Mason said, Ms. Bovasso went onstage to tell the audience to go home.         Ms. Bovasso was born in Brooklyn. She attended the High School of Music and Art and City College.         She is survived by her mother, Angela Bovasso of Staten Island, and a brother, Bernard X. Bovasso of Saugerties, N.Y.         Correction:  September 20, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress and playwright Julie Bovasso omitted the films in which she appeared. They include "Willie and Phil" (1980), "The Verdict" (1982), "Moonstruck" (1987) and "Betsy's Wedding" (1990).       
         Catherine M. Prelinger, a Yale lecturer, author and historian, died on Saturday at the Yale Health Plan Care Center in New Haven. She was 66 years old and lived in Killingsworth, Conn.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Prelinger was an associate editor of Yale's Papers of Benjamin Franklin project, which she joined in 1970. She also was a member of the advisory committee on women's programs at the Harvard Divinity School.         Long a prominent figure in the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, Mrs. Prelinger served as its president from 1975 to 1977 and last year was a member of its nominating committee.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Prelinger was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar College who earned her Ph.D. in history at Yale University in 1954.         She also contributed to scholarly journals both in this country and in Germany and had just completed the editing of a book, "Episcopal Woman," to be published next year by the Oxford University Press in New York.         Mrs. Prelinger is survived by her husband, Dr. Ernst Prelinger, a Yale University psychologist; two daughters, Dr. Katherine Holden of Sharon, Conn., and Edith Holden Roth of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; a stepson, Richard Prelinger of New York City; three stepdaughters, Elizabeth A. Prelinger of Washington, Polly Prelinger of San Francisco, and Jane Rothkopf of New York City; and six grandchildren.       
         Lydia Cabrera, a scholar and chronicler of Afro-Cuban culture, died at her home in Miami last Thursday of heart failure, according to her companion, Teresa de la Parra. Ms. Cabrera was 91 years old.         An ethnologist, artist, oral historian and writer of folk tales, Ms. Cabrera devoted most of her life to the study of Cuba's African-based culture and religions. Ms. Cabrera's Miami home, up to the time of her death, was a mecca for writers, academics, artists and students of Afro-Cuban culture and intellectual exiles from Cuba.         She produced 23 books about Cuba, including scholarly works and collections of folk tales rooted in Africa and passed down through generations of black Cuban slaves. Her best-known book was El Monte, published in 1954. It is considered the seminal book on santeria, the melange of Roman Catholic and African religious practices that developed in the Caribbean countries and that remains current. The Castro Government last year published El Monte without her permission.         Ms. Cabrera was born in Havana, but developed her interest in Afro-Cuban culture in Paris, where she had gone in 1927 to study Asian religion and art. She moved back to Cuba in 1938 and then fled, first to Madrid and then to Miami, in 1960, after the Cuban revolution. She lived in Spain again in the mid-1970's.         Ms. Cabrera held honorary doctorates from Denison University in Ohio, Redlands University in California and Manhattan College in New York City.         There were no immediate survivors.       
         Grace Zaring Stone, a novelist who also wrote under the pen name Ethel Vance, died on Sunday at the Mary Elizabeth Nursing Center in Mystic, Conn. She was 100 years old and had lived in Stonington, Conn.         Three of Mrs. Stone's novels were made into films: "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," in 1933, which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther; "Escape" (1940,) with Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor and Conrad Veidt, and "Winter Meeting" (1948,) with Bette Davis.         "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," about a New England woman who arrives in China to marry a missionary but becomes a captive of a Chinese warlord, was the first movie to be shown at Radio City Music Hall.         "Escape," an anti-Nazi thriller, was written in 1939 under the pseudonym Ethel Vance. In 1942 the author said the pen name had been used to protect her daughter, Eleanor Perenyi, who was living in occupied Europe, and because Mrs. Stone's husband, Ellis, was the United States naval attache in Paris, where they were living.         The book became a best seller, and Mrs. Stone used the Vance name for some of her later books, including "Reprisal" (1942) and "Winter Meeting," (1946).         Mrs. Stone was the great-great-granddaughter of Robert Owen, the British social reformer and socialist who founded the cooperative colony of New Harmony in Indiana. Her mother died when she was born, and she spent most of her childhood "visiting around," she said.         "In all the houses of the Owen descendants there were many books being very thoroughly read and almost everyone kept diaries," she said. "Diary keeping, writing in general, was just something one did. Then I married into the Navy and of course that was very, very different. But when my husband was stationed at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, the place seemed to get me started."         She wrote an account of a hurricane, and the Atlantic Monthly bought it, and later bought a short story as well. Then "Bobbs-Merrill wrote to ask me if I had a novel in mind, by any chance," Mrs. Stone said, "and of course that was a most amazing question to me, because I'd had a novel in mind practically forever."         Mrs. Stone's first novel was "The Heaven and Earth of Dona Elena," published in 1929. Her other works included "The Cold Journey" (1934,) "The Secret Thread" (1949) and "Althea" (1962).         Surviving besides her daughter, a writer, of Stonington, are a grandson and a great-graddaughter.       
         Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells.         Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,         A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate. Calculated Past G.N.P.         After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.         In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.         In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.         Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.  Work in Restaurants         When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.         The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.         She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.         She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.       
         Sylvia Fine Kaye, a producer, lyricist and composer, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Dena Kaye of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaye, the widow of the actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man" (1945), "The Kid from Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman and Danny Kaye. There she began writing specialty material, including a Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Mr. Kaye. In 1940, the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue."         That year, she married Mr. Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for her husband and accompanied him on piano. Wit and Patter         Mrs. Kaye was known for her complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines. Most frequently cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization. "I wrote many songs for Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect love song."         For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely for her husband. She once estimated that she wrote more than 100 songs for him during their 40-year collaboration. She was also involved in the production of almost all his films. She was twice nominated fpr Academy Awards for her work on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953). Musical Comedy on Television         In the 1970's, she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. In 1979, she produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program, "Musical Comedy Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975 she was executive producer for a television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and edited "Assignment Children," a Unicef film that starred her husband.         In the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book about her life with Mr. Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She was also writing a catalogue of show-business material that she and her husband had donated to the Library of Congress.         Brooklyn College awarded her an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.         Mr. Kaye died in 1987 at age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.         Correction:  October 30, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the songwriter Sylvia Fine Kaye omitted a survivor. He is Robert Fine Forrest, of Manhattan, her brother.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht, an author of 18 books of history and biography who frequently espoused liberal social and political causes, died yesterday of congestive heart failure, her husband said. She was 59 years old.         Mrs. Feuerlicht was born in 1931 in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1952, and after working as an editor of The Glen Oaks News and This Month magazine, began writing books. She published biographies of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gandhi, Marie Curie, Theodore Roosevelt and Martin Luther King.         Among her most discussed works was her 1972 study, "McCarthy and McCarthyism," which argued that the late Wisconsin Senator was "an enemy of America's basic institutions" who "came closer to destroying America than any Communist, foreign or domestic."         Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Fred J. Cook described "McCarthy and McCarthyism" as "excellent, solidly researched."         Mrs. Feuerlicht's 1977 book on the trial and executions of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti was praised in The New York Times by John Leonard as "the most comprehensive and persuasive account of the case we have," although he faulted the author for her tendency to "pontificate."         She is survived by her husband, Herbert Alan Feuerlicht of Manhattan, and a son, Ira, of Brooklyn.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Doris Lilly, the author of "How to Marry a Millionaire" and a former newspaper society columnist, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Kurt von Schuschnigg, a friend and the executor of her estate.         Ms. Lilly was a witty participant in the social whirl of charity balls and nightclubs she featured in her books and as a gossip columnist for The New York Post, the McNaught Syndicate and WPIX television in New York. An Inspiration to Capote         "If it were true that money grew on trees, all my friends would be married to apes," she said. She once conceded that her columns were sometimes "silly" and that the people she wrote about were sometimes "shallow." But, she said, "they're pleasant and they smell good and they eat well and drink good wines, and that's all right."         Friends said she was the inspiration for the Holly Golightly character in Truman Capote's book "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         Her own first book, "How to Marry a Millionaire" (Putnam, 1951), became a hit movie starring Marilyn Monroe. Later, doing the updated "How to Marry a Billionaire" (Delacorte, 1984), she said: "A million dollars isn't much money these days. You can't even get a decent house for that."         Ms. Lilly's often provocatively titled books included "How to Make Love in Five Languages" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), "Glamor Girl" (Woodhill, 1977, with Robin Moore as co-author) and "Those Fabulous Greeks: Onassis, Niarchos and Livanos (Cowles, 1970). 'Never Fond of Poverty'         "She was never fond of poverty," wrote Cindy Adams, the New York Post columnist. Remarking on Ms. Lilly's skills in meeting rich people, Ms. Adams wrote that "when the rest of us were in camel's hair," Ms. Lilly received a prized sable coat from a male admirer "who was a little bit married."         Ms. Lilly herself never married anyone, millionaire or otherwise. But she did socialize with the famous and powerful. Even in her youth as a contract actress for Cecil B. DeMille, she had an eye for up and coming people. She dated Ronald Reagan when he was between marriages to Jane Wyman and Nancy Davis.         Three years ago, two letters that Mr. Reagan sent Ms. Lilly were auctioned at Sotheby's to Malcolm Forbes, the publisher, for $4,400. She said that "these letters were written during the period we saw each other, which went on for three years."         Ms. Lilly, who was born in South Pasadena, Calif., attended public schools in Santa Monica. She had a continuing magazine career, working variously as beauty editor of Town and Country and a contributor to McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and, at the time of her death, Avenue.         She was a columnist for The Post from 1968 to 1978, and a commentator for WPIX from 1974 to 1977. She was also a frequent guest on the Merv Griffin Show and television panel shows.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Simone Beck, a passionate cook, author and teacher who collaborated with Julia Child on the influential cookbook "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," died yesterday at her home in Placassier, a small village in southern France. She was 87 years old.         Miss Beck, who preferred to be called Simca, had been having heart problems for several months and had stopped eating, said Harold Earle, a cousin. "The doctor said that because she wouldn't eat, she died," he said.         Miss Beck, a champion of regional French cooking, also wrote two cookbooks of her own, "Simca's Cuisine,"' and "New Menus from Simca's Cuisine," both now out of print. Her latest book, "Food and Friends: A Memoir With Recipes," was written with Suzy Patterson and published in August by Viking. 'Changed People's Attitudes'         "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," a two-volume set published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1961 and 1970, was a seminal work in the development of cooking in the United States. "The book changed people's attitudes totally, toward cooking as a real worthwhile pursuit," said Nach Waxman, owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters, a culinary bookshop in New York. Miss Beck, he said, was "an incredibly good home cook" who was never trendy, but never dull.         Miss Beck was born on July 7, 1904, in Tocqueville-en-Caux, near Dieppe in Normandy, into a wealthy family that had made its fortune from the production of Benedictine liqueur. As a child, she learned about cooking from the family cook. She studied cooking in Paris at Cordon Bleu, where she met Julia Child at a cocktail party in 1949.         "We were like sisters," said Mrs. Child, after learning of Miss Beck's death. "We were a pair of cooking nuts. She was a wonderful and generous friend. We called her La Super Francaise, because she was so French: a wonderful teacher, wonderful enthusiasm." In addition to working on books together, the two along with Louisette Bertholle, the third collaborator on the first volume of "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," ran L'Ecole de Trois Gourmandes in Paris.         In 1937, several years after a first marriage ended, Miss Beck married Jean Fischbacher, a chemical engineer who died in 1986.         She is survived by her brother, Bernard Beck, of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence, and five nephews.       
         Berenice Abbott, a pioneer of modern American photography, died yesterday at her home in Monson, Me. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Hank O'Neal, her biographer.         Miss Abbott is best known for her powerful black-and-white photographs of New York City in the 1930's. In these pictures, she used the tools of modernist photographic style -- including dynamically framed compositions, flattened pictorial space, high angles, and great detail -- to capture the enormous energy and variety of the city.         Perhaps her most famous picture, a view of New York at night taken from the top of the Empire State Building, presents the city as a glittering tapestry of light, with massive buildings thrusting up from the criss-crossed streets. In her New York photographs, many of which were collected in the book "Changing New York" (1939), Miss Abbott also provided an invaluable historical record of the physical appearance of the city at a time when it was undergoing rapid transformation.         Miss Abbott first achieved fame as a photographer in Paris in the 1920's with her penetrating portraits of such artists and writers as James Joyce, Janet Flanner and Jean Cocteau. She is also known for a series of photographs illustrating laws and processes of physics. Documentary Advocate         As a participant in the photographic controversies of her day, Miss Abbott was an eloquent and contentious advocate of the documentary approach. In books and articles she argued that photography was uniquely a descriptive medium, and should not be used to simulate effects that could better be achieved in other arts. "Photography can never grow up if it imitates some other medium," she wrote in 1951. "It has to walk alone; it has to be itself."         Miss Abbott was also known as the person primarily responsible for the present-day fame of the French photographer Eugene Atget, whom she met in Paris two years before his death in 1927. For almost four decades Atget had earned a modest living photographing the artistic monuments of Paris and its environs, selling prints to artists, publishers and archivists. In the course of this work he had built up a large file of photographs documenting Parisian life and culture.         Upon his death Miss Abbott bought the almost 1,500 glass-plate negatives and some 8,000 prints remaining in his studio. When she returned to New York in 1929, she brought the materials with her, and in following years arranged exhibitions, print sales and the publication of several books of Atget's work.  The collection remained in Miss Abbott's possession until 1968, when it was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art; it later became the basis for a series of four exhibitions and books that was completed in 1984. Assistant to Man Ray         Atget's photographs, which combine straightforward description with great formal beauty, have exerted a great influence on the development of American photography. Most notably they served as a model for the work of Walker Evans, who first saw them in New York shortly after Miss Abbott's return from Paris. In the years since, Atget has provided an important example of purpose and style to a host of other photographers.         Born in Springfield, Ohio, on July 17, 1898, Berenice Abbott studied briefly at Ohio State University before going first to New York and then, in 1921, to Europe to study sculpture and drawing. She went into photography by accident, going to work in Paris in 1923 as a darkroom assistant for the American Surrealist Man Ray. In 1925 she took up portrait photography as a means of earning a living, but quickly discovered her love and aptitude for the work. In 1926 she opened her own studio, and soon built up a successful career as a portrait photographer.         On a short visit to the United States in 1929 she was excited by the speed and energy of New York, and decided to undertake a project to record the changing face of the city. She moved back to the United States and began to photograph, working first with a small, hand-held camera. By 1932, though, she had switched to a large-format camera that produced 8-by-10-inch negatives capable of recording great detail. 'Changing New York'         For several years she financed the project herself. In 1935, though, she was able to obtain support from the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration and began to produce the pictures that were published four years later as "Changing New York." She focused on architectural details and important historical buildings, as well as bridges and skyscrapers, often aiming her camera up or down to achieve dizzying perspectives. Occasionally she included people in the pictures, but her primary emphasis was on the physical structure of the city. Her pictures of row houses and tenements, elevated trains and automats, warehouses and store fronts, provide a remarkably thorough record of the city in all its diversity.         After completing her documentation of New York, Miss Abbott turned to scientific photography and invention, and in 1958 she joined the physical science study committee of Education Services Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., to take photographs for a new high-school physics text. Many of her pictures from this time have a remarkable geometric beauty while at the same time providing clear illustrations of such physical phenomena as the interference patterns produced by two sets of waves or the refraction of a beam of light through a prism.         Her scientific photographs won her new acclaim both before and after the textbook "Health" was published in 1960. In the opinion of her principal biographer, Mr. O'Neal, her scientific work "may well be viewed in future years as her outstanding contribution to photography." A Major Retrospective         During her years in New York, Miss Abbott was an active freelance photographer. She established the photography program at the New School for Social Research, and published several other books. In 1966 she moved to Maine, where she lived until her death, although she retained a connection to the city through a continuing association with the New York Public Library, which sponsored a major retrospective exhibition of her work in 1989.         The New York exhibition, organized by Julia van Haaften, later traveled to Dallas, Atlanta, Toledo, Ohio, and Tokyo. Over the years Miss Abbott's work was the subject of many other exhibitions at major museums, including the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology in Washington (1969) and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1970). In 1982 her life and work were summed up in a book, "Berenice Abbott: American Photographer," by Mr. O'Neal.         There are no survivors. A spokesman for the New York Public Library said a memorial service would be held in the library's Celeste Bartos Forum at a date to be announced.         Correction:  December 20, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Dec. 11 about the photographer Berenice Abbott misstated the title of the 1960 textbook in which photographs by Miss Abbott appeared. It was "Physics."
