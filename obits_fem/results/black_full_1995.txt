         Willette Craine Murray, a founder of La Famille restaurant in Harlem, a fixture for Southern food and Sunday-night jazz, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 82.         Her husband, Earle, said she died of a heart attack.         From the time Mrs. Murray and her sister, the late Viola James, opened their restaurant with their husbands, Oswald Craine and Ben James, in 1958, the fresh corn bread, fried chicken, braised short ribs, black-eyed peas and string beans drew crowds to the restaurant, on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street.         When the restaurant was sold in 1989, La Famille, which opened with seating for 40, had spread into three dining rooms, where 300 people could dine while listening to jazz bands that Mrs. Murray helped make a Sunday night fixture.         For Mrs. Murray, a native of Charlotte, N.C., who came to New York in 1933, owning and operating a business on 125th Street was a triumph. One of the first black women to work on 125th Street, she had to march on picket lines in the 1930's to win her first job, washing glasses at a dime-store lunch counter.         She later worked as dining room hostess and assistant banquet manager at the old Theresa Hotel.         Mrs. Murray, whose sister and first husband died many years ago, is survived by Mr. Murray.       
         Elizabeth Montgomery, the pert actress who enchanted television audiences as the star of the long-running comedy series "Bewitched," died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 57.         Last month, Ms. Montgomery underwent surgery for the removal of what was characterized at the time as a small malignant tumor. Her family would not disclose the type of cancer.         "Bewitched," a top-rated ABC situation comedy set in suburbia, ran from 1964 to 1972. Its green-eyed star played Samantha, a witch and the wife of an advertising executive who tried to suppress her supernatural talents yet often resorted to sorcery to solve problems.         The comedic twist was that her efforts to shun witchcraft were strongly resented by her kin. They included Samantha's mother, Endora, played by Agnes Moorehead, and the trouble-making Serena, a look-alike cousin also played by Ms. Montgomery. The clue to Samantha's impending sorcery was a twitch of her nose. The witch's perplexed husband, Darrin, was played first by Dick York and then by Dick Sargent.         "Bewitched" was Ms. Montgomery's first and only television series. After the series ended, she had a successful career as a star in made-for-television movies. One of them, "Deadline for Murder," was broadcast by CBS last week. In it, the actress portrayed the reporter Edna Buchanan, whom she had played in "The Corpse Had a Familiar Face" in 1994.         Ms. Montgomery was born on April 15, 1938, her publicity agent said. Her father was the actor and director Robert Montgomery. Her mother, Elizabeth Allen Montgomery, was an actress.         A native of Los Angeles, she graduated from the Spence School in New York City and attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. After three years of intensive training, she made her television debut in the 1950's television playhouse series "Robert Montgomery Presents," of which her father was the producer and host.         In the 1950's and 60's, she also appeared in films, including "The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell" (1955), with Gary Cooper, and "Johnny Cool" (1963). She was narrator of "The Panama Deception," a documentary about the American invasion of Panama, which won an Academy Award in 1993.         Her television movies often won critical praise. Among them were "A Case of Rape" (1974), "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" (1975) and "Black Widow Murders: The Blanche Taylor Moore Story" (1993).         She is survived by her husband, the actor Robert Foxworth, and three children from an earlier marriage to William Asher, the producer of "Bewitched." Her first husband was the actor Gig Young.       
         Jean Muir, the British fashion classicist whose design career spanned more than 30 years, died on Sunday in London at the London Clinic. She was 66.         She died of breast cancer, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.         Often referred to as the doyenne of British fashion, Miss Muir, as she insisted everyone call her, designed starkly simple clothes that were timeless and elegant. A perfectionist who tried on everything she designed, she was best known for matte jersey dresses, supple suedes, featherlight punched leathers and cashmere sweaters.         She considered herself a dressmaker first and foremost, yet employed tailoring techniques to achieve the controlled flow of fabric that gave her jersey dresses their signature fit. The shoulders were small, the waist slightly raised and the skirt fluid. It was a shape that particularly suited her petite figure. The dresses were nearly always in the somber black and navy blue she preferred and wore almost exclusively.         Miss Muir developed a personal style that changed very little. For most of her life, her reddish brown hair was cut into a straight bob, her face was chalky white and her lipstick the color of black currants. Her London apartment was entirely white, down to the white rubber flooring. She was frequently quoted as saying, "When you find something that suits you and never lets you down, why not stick with it?" It was a statement that applied equally well to herself and to the clothes she designed, which were instantly identifiable as Jean Muirs and never followed the vagaries of fashion.         "Jean was unique and original and irreplaceable," said Geraldine Stutz, the former president and owner of Henri Bendel in New York, which carried Miss Muir's clothing from the early 60's until the late 80's. The clothes can now be found at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Linda Dresner.         "You can say unique and irreplaceable," Ms. Stutz added, "but in Jean's case it is literally and historically true. For years, other designers tried to copy the Jean Muir look and failed. The only ones who didn't try were the French, who called her 'la reine de la robe,' the dress queen."         Yet, Miss Muir never had formal design training. Born in London and of Scottish descent, she attended boarding school in Bedfordshire, where she was taught sewing and knitting. At 11 she started to make clothes for herself and at 19 went to work in the stockroom at Liberty, the London store. She eventually became a sketcher in the store's made-to-measure department, and she went to Jaeger as a designer in 1956.         In 1962, she became the designer for Jane & Jane, a company of young Londoners who, along with designers like Mary Quant, helped to shake up the staid British fashion world. That was when she caught the eye of Jean Rosenberg, the foresighted buyer who brought her to Bendel's.         In 1966, she formed Jean Muir Ltd. in partnership with her husband, Harry Lueckert, a former German actor she had married in 1955. In her own business she was able to develop the style of clothing that appealed to women as diverse as Princess Alexandra, Lady Antonia Fraser, Glenda Jackson, Lauren Bacall and Joanna Lumley, the co-star of the British comedy "Absolutely Fabulous," who once worked as a Jean Muir model.         She won many fashion awards, including election to the British Fashion Awards Hall of Fame last year, and was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1984. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1973. She served on the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1979 to 1983 and became a trustee the next year.         Miss Muir, who had no children, is survived by her husband. She will be buried at Lorbottle, her estate in Northumberland, 15 miles from the Scottish border. A memorial service will be held at a later date.       
         Roberta Church, an official in the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations who was the first black woman to be elected to the Tennessee Republican State Executive Committee, died on Saturday at Baptist Memorial Hospital East in Memphis. She was 81 and lived in Memphis.         She had suffered a brief illness, said Ronald A. Walter, the co-author of one of her books.         Miss Church was the last survivor of a family of black Tennesseans who were prominent in business and Republican politics when few Southern blacks were active in either business or the party.         With her aunt, Annette E. Church, she wrote a biography of her grandfather and father, "The Robert R. Churches of Memphis: A Father and Son Who Achieved in Spite of Race" (Burke's, 1974). She also wrote, with Mr. Walter, "Nineteenth-Century Memphis Families of Color, 1850-1900" (Burke's; 2d ed., 1989).         Miss Church, whose full name was Sara Roberta Church, was born in Memphis and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Northwestern University. Her grandfather, Robert R. Sr., founded Memphis's first black bank and was believed to be the first black millionaire in the South.         Her father was an early civil rights leader; in 1916 he formed the Lincoln League to register and organize voters, and in 1917 he founded Tennessee's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         He died in 1952 while campaigning for a seat on the Republican State Executive Committee. Miss Church took over the campaign and was elected in his stead to represent Memphis and surrounding Shelby County.         In 1953 she was named by the Eisenhower Administration to promote equal employment opportunities as a Labor Department consultant. In 1961 she started a Civil Service career as an administrator of Federal-state programs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, later the Department of Health and Human Services. She retired in 1982.         Miss Cook also served two terms under President Richard M. Nixon as a member of his Advisory Council on Adult Education.       
         Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala. By her own reckoning she was about 85.         When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.         Mrs. Logan, the 14th of 16 children, was born on a farm in Marengo County, outside Sweet Water, about 120 miles north of Mobile.         On the surface, her life was little different from those of other black women of her era in southern Alabama. As a child she picked cotton, sewed and ironed to make money for her family. And for all her infectious optimism and perpetual good cheer, even as a "granny," as midwives were known in the South, Mrs. Logan, the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, was hardly unique.         In 1910, about half of the births in the United States were assisted by midwives, and the percentage was far higher in the rural south. Their clients were generally so poor that even Mrs. Logan, who delivered virtually every child born in the predominantly black Mobile suburb of Prichard from 1931 to 1984, had to supplement her income by working as a maid.         What ultimately set Mrs. Logan apart was not her work, but her compelling sense that hers was a story that had to be told. Or, as she put it, "I just got so much experience in here that I just want to explode."         Although she was barely literate, Mrs. Logan said she was so determined to tell it she would be prepared to "scratch it out" herself.         That proved unnecessary when a family she worked for introduced her to Katherine Clark, a young Harvard graduate who came to Mobile in 1984 to teach English at the University of South Alabama and is now a professor of English at the University of New Orleans.         "As soon as I met her, I knew there was a book in her," Professor Clark said yesterday, recalling that she had taped 100 hours of Mrs. Logan's recollections before editing them into what became "Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story" (Dutton, 1989).         The book, still in print as a Plume paperback, was widely praised both for its vivid accounts of Mrs. Logan's life told in her distinctive vernacular and for her unflinchingly optimistic spirit in the face of pervasive adversity.         "Motherwit" made Mrs. Logan something of a folk hero, and two years ago she was represented along with Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Frank, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Joan Didion and other feminist luminaries in "The Norton Book of Women's Lives" (Norton, 1993).         Although lay midwives were outlawed by the state of Alabama in 1976, Mrs. Logan had attained such stature in Mobile that she was allowed to continue her practice under a permit from local authorities until 1984, when she received an abrupt notice telling her there was no longer a need for her services.         Mrs. Logan, who had delivered babies for almost two decades before receiving a state license in 1949, retired from her profession, but refused to abandon her calling. Despite all the advances in medical services to the poor, she knew that midwives were too often not the alternative to hospitals, but to husbands.         "They're not going to stop me from doing the gift that God give me to do," she said. "I don't be going there on no license. I be going there as a friend to help that husband deliver his baby."         Mrs. Logan, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Roosevelt Logan; a son, Johnnine Watkins of Moss Point, Miss; a sister, Louise Blackman of Pensacola, Fla.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Before she made her Metropolitan Opera debut last Saturday in the title role  of Bizet's "Carmen," Denyce Graves kept telling herself that the Met was simply  another opera house. After all, she had already sung the role at the Vienna State Opera, at the Bastille Opera in Paris and at Covent Garden, 21 productions in the last two years alone.         "I tried to think of this as just another engagement," she said recently, "but nobody would let me do that."         She was referring not only to managers and the news media, but also to her family, friends and former teachers from the tough southwest Washington neighborhood where she grew up, a gritty area near a sewage treatment center and an automobile impoundment lot. More than 50 of her relatives and former neighbors traveled to New York by chartered bus for her Met debut; some 50 more  came by train and car.         For years, most people at home saw Ms. Graves as "some sort of space alien,"  she said, what with her exotic notions of becoming an opera singer. But "a Met debut was something they understood," she said, and the tumultuous standing ovation she got on Saturday night "really clinched it for them." She sings the role again this afternoon and on Wednesday and next Saturday.         Ms. Graves knows that her personal story is the kind of inspirational saga Americans love: a television crew from "60 Minutes" covered her Met debut. "This was not just a move for myself, but for my people, my family," the 30-year-old mezzo-soprano said. "I realize now that what I say affects my family, so I've become more protective of their feelings, my mother's in particular. It's not just my story; it's hers."         Ms. Graves was the second of three children. Her father, an alcoholic, abusive man, left the family when her mother was pregnant with their third child. The children did not see him for again for 18 years, when he turned up, unannounced, at the high school graduation of Ms. Graves's younger sister. By then he had become a minister. They have not heard from him since.         Left alone with three children to raise, Ms. Graves's mother found work as a  clerk-typist at the University of the District of Columbia. (Today, Mrs. Dorothy Graves Kenner, her name from a second marriage, is registrar.) She was out of the house before the children were up, and gone most of the day. "When she got home, we had to have dinner ready," Ms. Graves said. "We did the cooking, dishwashing and cleaning in rotating one-week shifts."         Yet her mother provided a rich, if regimented, family life. Participation in  their fundamentalist Baptist church was mandatory. Ms. Graves sang in the choir  and helped out at Sunday school. At home, her mother dedicated each night of the week to some educational project: one night the children would present oral book reports or speak on assigned topics (like birds, flowers or geography). Thursday was music night, when the family performed gospel as an impromptu vocal group at churches and meeting halls. Popular music of any kind was banned in the house, though Ms. Graves listened to some illicit Michael Jackson on the radio when she was alone. "My mother worked so hard," Ms. Graves said. "She didn't want her babies to be lost to the streets, like so many."         At school, Ms. Graves's singing was encouraged by a strong-willed music teacher, Judith Grove. "I adored her," Ms. Graves said. "I thought she hung the  moon." Ms. Grove directed her to the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, a public high school in Washington. She was accepted immediately. There, she received private voice lessons and attended her first opera: a dress rehearsal for Beethoven's "Fidelio," on a school expedition to the Kennedy Center.         After high school, Ms. Graves made great progress under Helen Hodam, a renowned voice teacher, first at Oberlin Conservatory, and then at the New England Conservatory. In Boston, she took side jobs to support herself: cleaning dormitories, working as an all-night hotel desk clerk. When she decided to enter the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions, she had all the makings of a finalist: a lustrous mezzo-soprano voice and a striking stage presence. But her  performance was charged with a special determination. "I had to win," she said.  "I was four months behind in my rent. I couldn't pay for the rented dress I was wearing." Ms. Graves won.         The pressure took its toll. After the competition, her voice failed her. The  problem later turned out to be a treatable thyroid condition. But her performance at the finals in New York City was "a disaster," Ms. Graves said. Demoralized, she quit singing and took a secretarial job.         Yet the word of her promise had spread. The Houston Grand Opera called to invite her to participate in its program for young artists. She declined. When they called twice more, her friends prevailed on her to accept. ("It was a sign, like something meant to be," she said.)         Since then, her success has come steadily. One of her big supporters is Placido Domingo, who sang Don Jose to her Carmen at Covent Garden. They first met in Houston when Ms. Graves sang Emilia in a production of Verdi's "Otello."  "What impressed me immediately about her, aside from her obvious vocal and physical beauty, was an aura of the dramatic about her," Mr. Domingo said recently.         "As Carmen," he continued, "she is so good that the world might want her exclusively for this role. That would be a shame, because she has very much to offer in other parts." In his capacity as future artistic director of the Washington Opera, Mr. Domingo has invited her to sing two other leading roles, which have not yet been announced.         In developing her approach to this signature role, Ms. Graves avoided listening to recordings of celebrated Carmens from the past. Moreover, she counts herself lucky to have done her first Carmen in a modern-dress production  at the Minnesota Opera.         "I didn't want to do a traditional Carmen," she said. "Carmen is an unapologetic modern woman, a woman of the 90's. She speaks constantly about her  freedom, but she is no whore. Her spirit is free. She is attracted to Don Jose precisely because he isn't interested. When she realizes she truly loves him, she becomes afraid and treats him badly. Love means losing your freedom. I think she is essentially a very sad person."         Vocally, she finds the role gratifying, but frustrating. Unlike the other characters, Carmen has no defining "stand-and-deliver aria," as Ms. Graves put it, which makes portraying her true character a challenge. "Carmen sings songs,  but these are set pieces involving other people," she said. Carmen's most famous song, the "Habanera," is a "dramatic miscalculation," according to Ms. Graves, wrongly inserted by Bizet into the score after the premiere at the insistence of the first Carmen, Celestine Galli-Marie. "It's an awkward introduction to Carmen," Ms. Graves said. "In the original version, she enters, sings her few insinuating lines, then leaves, like a black cat crossing the stage. That's much more in character."         Her recent performances include Adalgisa in "Norma" at Zurich, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" at La Scala, and Dalila in a concert performance of "Samson et Dalila" with the Chicago Symphony under James Levine. She is looking  forward to performing Marguerite in Berlioz's "Damnation of Faust" in Houston and Bonn ("I adore that music"), and hopes someday to sing Blanche in one of her favorites, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites."         The sudden attention has left Ms. Graves excited but unaffected. Greeting a visitor in her hotel suite, she curled up on the couch in an oversize sweatshirt and casually stirred gobs of honey into her tea with a dinner knife when no teaspoon was handy. As she relaxed next to her husband, David Perry, an importer of fine classical guitars, she seemed content with the way her life has turned out.         "Perhaps this should be the last interview about the past," Mr. Perry suggested. "From now on, the future will be the story." Ms. Graves nodded quietly.       
         Helen Vlachos, a publisher who closed her newspapers and fled Greece rather than submit to censorship under the military junta that ruled from 1967 to 1974, died on Saturday, Reuters reported yesterday from Athens, quoting officials at the press ministry. She was 85.         Ms. Vlachos was a legend in Greek journalism whose popularity rose in the late 1940's when she began writing a column in her father's respected daily paper, Kathimerini, in which she regularly criticized the Government.         In 1951, she took over Kathimerini and Messimvrini, another daily newspaper, as well as the weekly picture magazine Eikones, but closed them all in 1967 when a group of army colonels seized power, instituted censorship and mandated Government-friendly daily reports.         Because she was a cheerfully outspoken member of the right, anti-Communist rebels counted on her to back their coup and were shocked when she closed the high-circulation dailies.         They were even more disturbed when she openly mocked them in the Italian press, calling them "a circus," and commenting, "They can't tell me how to run newspapers anymore than I can tell them how to run their tanks."         Such wisecracks resulted in charges of "insulting authorities," and she was placed under house arrest in 1967. Although she faced several years in jail had she been brought to trial, she often made light of the situation in the press, and once said that were she ever imprisoned, she hoped it would be noted that her favorite dish was meatballs.         The same year, she made a daring escape from Athens to London that involved dying her hair black to match a fake passport and hiding out in a cramped bordello while her husband, Costas Loundras, tapped around their Athens flat in her high-heeled shoes to trick the guards into believing that she was still under their arrest.         From London she continued to aggressively pressure the government to lift restrictive policies against the press.         She returned home shortly after the junta fell in 1974, reopened her newspapers and was elected to Parliament as a member of the conservative New Democracy party. She published Kathimerini until 1987, when she sold her media holdings.         Ms. Vlachos was born in Athens on Dec. 18, 1911, and was sent abroad to be educated. When she returned to Greece, she went to work for her father as a bookkeeper, and became a reporter in 1935. During her career, she covered everything from Greek earthquakes to the Far East to Mussolini in Libya.         Her father, George, had already set a precedent for political opposition through the press -- he was jailed by a series of Greek Governments for his discourse, and refused to cooperate with Nazis when they took over one of his papers in 1941.         Ms. Vlachos chronicled her career and the adventure of her escape in her book "The House Arrest" (Gambit, 1970). In it she wrote: "The most thrilling aspect of this decision was that it was taken by the most conservative of men, by Costa, who with undue haste had drifted into middle age, silently condemning any kind of youthful flutter, choosing severe clothes, discouraging any tendency toward eccentricity, avoiding noisy parties, disliking on me anything conspicuous, insisting on my keeping my hair white."         Information about survivors was not available.       
         Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, the black honors graduate who needed a backhanded assist from the Supreme Court in 1948 to win admission to the University of Oklahoma law school, died on Wednesday at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 71  and had served for three years on the university's board of regents, the very body that had denied her admission on the basis of her race.         The cause of death was cancer, her daughter, Charlene Factory, said.         By the time Mrs. Fisher applied to the University of Oklahoma law school on  Jan. 14, 1946, the Supreme Court had long held that under the separate-but-equal doctrine, states that sponsored law schools for white students were required to  supply similar training for qualified black students.         Since Oklahoma had no law school for black students, it seemed obvious that the white law school would be required to admit the eminently qualified Mrs. Fisher. An honors graduate of Langston, a state-run black college, she had been  recruited by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to test the state's harsh segregation laws, which, among other things, imposed a fine on any teacher who taught a mixed-race class.         But Oklahoma argued that the state planned to open a black law school someday and kept Mrs. Fisher at bay for more than two years, until January 1948, when the Supreme Court rejected the state's arguments and ordered it to provide her with a legal education.         The court did not specifically order her admission to the university law school, and when Oklahoma tried to satisfy the court by instantly creating a black law school exclusively for Mrs. Fisher, the court turned down her follow-up appeal in February 1948. The court said her original petition had not  addressed the issue of whether the creation of a separate law school for black students would fulfill the state's obligations under the 14th Amendment.         Mrs. Fisher may not have won her immediate point before the Supreme Court, but the arguments raised by her lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, who had denounced the state action as a sham, had a powerful impact on the court as it picked its way  toward the landmark 1954 decision overturning the separate-but-equal doctrine.         And Mrs. Fisher's campaign, which had won wide backing from the state's college teachers and students, had changed the political climate in Oklahoma. With dozens of other black college graduates pressing for admission to Oklahoma  graduate schools, the state swiftly backed down.         Mrs. Fisher was admitted to the law school in June 1949, but under such harsh conditions that any of her fellow students who had not already rallied to her cause were soon won over. She was forced to sit in a raised chair apart from the other students, behind a sign reading "Colored." And she had to use a side door  to the cafeteria and sit at a table separated by a chain from the rest of the room; a uniformed guard was posted to prevent interracial mingling.         But when the guard was not there, Mrs. Fisher later recalled, white students  would climb under the chain to encourage her. "They said, 'Come on, Ada, we've been waiting for you.' "         After Mrs. Fisher graduated in 1951, she worked for a while as a lawyer. She  returned to the university to earn a master's degree in history in 1968, and she joined the faculty at Langston University.         When she was appointed to the seven-member board of regents in April 1992, Mrs. Fisher said she had come full circle.         Mrs. Fisher's survivors all live in Oklahoma City; her husband, Warren, died  several years ago. In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, Bruce; a sister, Helen Huggins; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rosalind Cash, an original member of the Negro Ensemble Company and one of its most vibrant and versatile actresses, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 56.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, John Sekura.         Although she was best known for her acting in naturalistic dramas like Lonne Elder 3d's "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men," Ms. Cash was equally at home in musicals and in classics, portraying Goneril to James Earl Jones's King Lear for the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1973.         Before joining the Negro Ensemble Company in 1968, Ms. Cash had a widely diverse career, singing in nightclubs and performing Off Broadway (in "Junebug Graduates Tonight!" at the Chelsea Theater Center) and on Broadway (in "The Wayward Stork"). Cast in "The Great White Hope" at the Arena Stage in Washington, she decided to forgo that play, and paid the Arena the equivalent of two weeks' salary so she could return to New York to join the new black theater  company.         In the first season of the Negro Ensemble Company, she was featured in "The Song of the Lusitanian Bogey" by Peter Weiss, Wole Soyinka's "Kongi's Harvest" and Richard Wright's "Sweet Daddy Goodness." In "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men" the next year, Douglas Turner Ward played a barber facing economic hardship. Ms. Cash was his strong-minded daughter, the family's principal wage-earner. The role remained a hallmark of her career, and in 1975 she repeated it in the ABC television version.         After her initial success, she moved back and forth between theater and films. In 1980 she returned to the Negro Ensemble Company to appear in "The 16th Round" by Samm-Art Williams.         In Hollywood, she repeatedly battled stereotype. Calling herself "a one-lady  movement," she was not afraid to speak her mind, realizing that as an actress, "if you yell loud enough, someone will listen." Her movies included "Klute," "The Omega Man," "Hickey and Boggs," "The New Centurions," "Uptown Saturday Night" and "Wrong Is Right" (in which she played the first black woman to become Vice President of the United States). In 1995, she was in "Tales From the 'Hood."         On television she appeared in Melvin van Peebles's "Sophisticated Gents," Maya Angelou's "Sister, Sister," "A Killing Affair" and the American Playhouse adaptation of James Baldwin's "Go Tell It on the Mountain." She was Mary Mae Ward on the soap opera "General Hospital."         Ms. Cash was born in Atlantic City and attended City College of New York.         She is survived by a sister, Helen Cash Jackson, and two brothers, Jack and Robert.       
         Florence Greenberg, a one-time New Jersey housewife who parlayed an unlikely  hit record by a teen-age group known as the Shirelles into an improbable career  as the proprietor of a leading independent label of the 1960's, died on Thursday at the Hackensack University Medical Center. She was 82, and lived in Teaneck, N.J.         As a pioneering woman in the male-dominated world of rhythm-and-blues, Mrs. Greenberg was, by her own later account, a triple anomaly: "a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune."         Maybe so, but she had a finely tuned ear for popular music, a keen eye for talent and a driving ambition, all of which became increasingly apparent in the  1960's.         In addition to a series of hits by the Shirelles, among them "Dedicated to the One I Love," "Tonight's the Night," and Mrs. Greenberg's own composition, "Soldier Boy," her Scepter label produced such 1960's standards as "Louie, Louie," by the Kingsmen; "Twist and Shout," by the Isley Brothers, and "Walk on  By," by Dionne Warwick, not to mention "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," the  Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, sung by B. J. Thomas on the soundtrack of "Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which won an Academy Award in 1969.         Mrs. Greenberg traced her success to a day in 1957 when her 16-year-old daughter, Mary Jane, came home raving about the performance of four classmates at a Passaic High School assembly.         Their names were Shirley Alston, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner and Beverly Lee,  but they called themselves the Shirelles, and as soon as Mrs. Greenberg persuaded them to sing for her, she knew that their song, "I Met Him on a Sunday," had the makings of a hit.         A former Republican campaign worker who had translated her political skills into a job peddling songs for a local songwriters, Mrs. Greenberg, who had been  married to an accountant, had already become a familiar figure on Tin Pan Alley, hobnobbing with music-industry hopefuls at the old Turf restaurant on Broadway at 51st Street. She had also joined with two partners to form a label, Tiara Records.         The Tiara release of "I Met Him on a Sunday" was such an immediate success. Within months, Mrs.  Greenberg climbed so many radio-station stairs, sold so many records from the trunk of her car and created such demand that her company  could not handle the orders. So she sold the Shirelles' contract to Decca, an industry giant.         That might have been the end of her career, but, Decca, convinced that the Shirelles would be a one-hit phenomenon, returned the group to Mrs. Greenberg, who formed Scepter to replace Tiara.         Over the next decade, Scepter became an industry sensation as Mrs. Greenberg, whose company eventually occupied an entire floor of 1650 Broadway, repeatedly demonstrated her sure sense of talent.         This was never more evident than the day in 1962 when Mr. Bacharach played a  demonstration record of one of his songs for Mrs. Greenberg, and she told him that while she did not like the song she loved the singer.         The next day, Mr. Bacharach returned, saying he had a signed contract with the singer, a young woman named Dionne Warwick.         Partly because of the long line of hit Warwick releases that followed, Gulf & Western offered $6 million for Scepter in 1965, but Mrs. Greenberg declined to sell.         It was, she later said, a major mistake. Within a decade, as major labels came to dominate the distribution network, Scepter's success had faded, and by the time the company folded in 1977 Mrs. Greenberg had lost everything.         In recent years, Mrs. Greenberg had been cheered by Bette Midler's plans to make a movie of her life, but because Ms. Midler has been unable to secure the required rights from two of the three surviving Shirelles (Ms. Harris died in 1982), the project is dormant.         She is survived by her daughter, Mary Jane Goff of Upper Saddle River, N.J.;  a son, Stanley, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Minnie Lee Langley, an early and persistent leader in the effort to have the  State of Florida compensate survivors of a white mob's rampage in the black settlement of Rosewood, Fla., in 1923, died on Saturday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 83 and lived in Jacksonville.         She had cancer surgery earlier in the week, her family said.         Mrs. Langley was one of the few remaining witnesses to one of the worst episodes of racial violence in Florida history. A white mob, looking for a black man accused of assaulting a white woman, was responsible for a week of burning and shooting that left at least six Rosewood residents dead and the hamlet in ruins. Two white men were also killed.         Mrs. Langley and eight other survivors received some satisfaction last year when Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, signed a bill recognizing the depravity of  the event and authorizing $150,000 in compensation for each of them. She was the lead witness in the legislative hearings, providing vivid testimony about the destruction of Rosewood. In the end, the state acknowledged that the authorities, from Gov. Cary Hardee on down, had failed to protect the hamlet's residents.         Mrs. Langley was one of several children staying in an uncle's home when the  mob closed in on a January night. They escaped through a rear door and hid shivering in the woods for several days. The mob never found the man it was looking for, and doubt remains whether any white woman had been attacked.         After moving to Jacksonville in 1926, Mrs. Langley made a living making brooms and brushes.         She is survived by a son, Anthony H. and a daughter, Dorothy Smith, both of Jacksonville; 10 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Porter Wesley, a librarian who played the primary role in building Howard University's collection of books and other materials for the study of black history and culture, died on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at the home  of her daughter, where she had moved recently from Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Wesley retired in 1973 as the curator of the Moorland-Spingarn Research  Center, a center for research involving documents about black history and kindred fields. The center is on the Howard campus in Washington.         She began acquiring books and other materials in 1930 and from then until 1973, the center's holdings grew to 180,000 items from 3,000. They include letters, manuscripts, pamphlets, books, oral-history materials and microfilms.         The centeris one of the world's largest repositories of materials for studying black history and culture, its current director, Dr. Thomas C. Battle,  said yesterday.         Over the years, Mrs. Wesley was also known by the surname Porter and the double surname Porter Wesley. Her 1971 book, "Early Negro Writings 1760-1837" was republished this fall, by Black Classic Press, with her name given as Dorothy Porter.         She began working at Howard in 1928 as a library cataloger and was named, in  1930, librarian of what was to become the Moorland-Spingarn center's collection. At the time, it was called the Moorland Foundation because it consisted chiefly  of a books donated by Dr. Jesse Moorland, a Howard trustee; in 1946 the book collection of Arthur B. Spingarn was added to it.         Mrs. Wesley's other writings include the books "North American Negro Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist" (1945), "Negro Protest Pamphlets" (1969) and "The Negro in the United States: A Selected Bibliography" (1970).         Mrs. Wesley, whose maiden name was Burnett, was born in Warrenton, Va., and reared in Montclair, N.J. She went received a bachelor's degree in 1928 from Howard and a master's degree in library science in 1932 from Columbia University.         Her first husband, James Amos Porter, who had headed Howard's fine arts department, died in 1970. She married Charles Harris Wesley, an authority on black history and former professor and dean at Howard, in 1979. He died in 1987.         Her survivors include her daughter, Constance Burnett Porter Uzelac of Fort Lauderdale.       
         Butterfly McQueen, the actress best remembered for her portrayal of Prissy in "Gone With the Wind," the vexing slave girl who confounded Scarlett O'Hara with  the tearful pronouncement, "I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett," died yesterday. She was 84 years old.         Earlier in the day, Ms. McQueen was critically burned when a kerosene heater  in her one-bedroom cottage just outside Augusta, Ga., caught fire. She suffered  burns over 70 percent of her body and died at Augusta Regional Medical Center.         After appearing in the Civil War epic "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, Ms. McQueen's voice, squeaky and high-pitched, became her most remarked-upon characteristic, prompting one critic to describe it as a "clarinet with a cold"  and another to comment that it was an "itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension."         Although Ms. McQueen's role as Prissy earned her fame, it also brought her criticism in later years from people who considered the role stereotypical and demeaning.         "You know, today they call me an Uncle Thomasina," she said in 1970.         But Ms. McQueen, who devoted her later years to serving the African-American  community, said she also felt it necessary to acknowledge the history of black slavery in the United States.         "As I look back on "Gone with the Wind," for instance, I feel it is useful to have this authenticity," she once said. "We've got to know more about where we've come from. I wasn't too happy about the whole thing, but also later in life, as I looked around, I decided to take what I could get and then use it for what I want to do."         Born Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Fla., daughter of a housekeeper and a stevedore, Ms. McQueen first developed a fondness for acting as a child, when she would recite whole books of the Bible at home.         "All I knew as a child was church, church, church," she said.         When her parents separated, Ms. McQueen moved with her mother to Augusta, Ga., and then to New York City. As a teen-ager, she attended high school in Babylon, L.I., and later moved to Harlem.         After a brief stint in nursing school, Ms. McQueen pursued her acting career  in earnest, finding that the stage was much more exciting than a hospital. Her first break came in 1937 when George Abbott offered her a role in "Brown Sugar." The show was a flop, but Ms. McQueen signed on as a permanent member of the Abbott Acting Company.         It was during her years with the acting company that a friend dubbed her "Butterfly," after Ms. McQueen told her she had once danced a butterfly ballet in a performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."         Soon after, Mr. Abbott tailored a role for her in "What a Life," which she played on Broadway. One evening, during an intermission in Philadelphia, she received a contract from her agency for Prissy, a role she was initially rejected for after a talent scout called her too chubby. She received the good news with some reservation.         "I'd just come from a modern up-to-date integrated school in 'What a Life' and I couldn't understand why they'd want to bring back the 1800s," Ms. McQueen  said. "Most of my friends were progressive, going forward and looking forward. It was depressing for me."         Despite the success of "Gone With The Wind," Ms. McQueen found it increasingly difficult to find work in film and theater. She appeared in the films "Mildred Pierce" and "The Women," and on several radio shows. In 1951, she put on a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall, but she soon found she had to take on  other jobs to support herself. During the 1950's, she worked as a companion for  a woman in Long Island and sold toys at Macy's. At one time, she began her own radio show in Augusta, "to instill pride in the neighborhood," she said.         In 1966, still unable to find work as an actress, Ms. McQueen wrote a letter  to a Georgia congressman asking him for help in getting a job.         But it was upon her return to Harlem one year later that she found a second vocation -- helping her community. She plunged into antipoverty work and took a  job as a waitress in a soul food restaurant.         Fond of children, she worked at the Mount Morris Park Recreation Center as a  receptionist. Her distinctive voice could be heard through the corridors as she  gave tap dance and ballet lessons. She defined herself at the time through her commitment to the "black family," she said.         Ever restless and determined, Ms. McQueen, who had never completed college, graduated with a degree in political science from City College in 1975 at the age of 64.       
         Roxie Roker, a star of the long-running CBS television series "The Jeffersons," died on Saturday, her publicity agent said. She was 66.         Her family, including her son, Lenny Kravitz, the rock guitarist and singer,  declined to release further details, said the publicity agent, Cynthia Snyder.         Ms. Roker was born in Miami. She grew up in Brooklyn, earned a drama degree  from Howard University in Washington and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-on-Avon, England. While holding an office job at NBC in New York in the 1960's, she appeared in Off Broadway shows, including Jean Genet's play "The Blacks." In 1967-68, she was a host of "Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant," a community-oriented show on WNEW-TV.         After resigning from NBC and turning full time to acting, Ms. Roker appeared  onstage with the Negro Ensemble Company in "Ododo" and "Rosalee Pritchet." She won an Obie Award, and was a 1974 Tony nominee for her performance as Mattie Williams in "The River Niger." Her other Off Broadway credits include "Behold! Cometh the Vanderkellans" (1971) and "Jamimma" (1972).         Ms. Roker moved to California when the producer Norman Lear cast her in "The  Jeffersons," a 1975 spinoff of his series "All in the Family." The new show moved Archie Bunker's black neighbors, the Jeffersons, from a blue-collar Queens neighborhood to a luxury apartment house in Manhattan.         The character played by Ms. Roker, Helen Willis, was a black woman with a white husband, Tom (Franklin Cover), television's first interracial couple. They were neighbors of George and Louise Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford), and the Willises' daughter eventually married the Jeffersons' son, Lionel. "The Jeffersons" ran for 10 years.         Ms. Roker later made guest appearances in other television series and specials and returned to the stage. She appeared in a stage production of "The Jeffersons" and toured with Mary Martin and Carol Channing in "Legends."         Her community work, including her role as a board member of the Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, earned her two citations from the Los Angeles City Council.         A marriage to Sy Kravitz, a former NBC executive, ended in divorce, said a spokesman for Virgin Records, their son's recording company.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Albert Roker, and a granddaughter, Zoe.       
         Toni Cade Bambara, a writer and documentary film maker who was celebrated for her intricate use of Black English in fiction, died on Saturday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 56 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Karma Bene Bambara of Philadelphia.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Bambara was a major contributor to the emerging genre of contemporary black women's literature, along with the writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and others. Many of her stories focused on men and women living in black neighborhoods in big cities or small Southern towns -- as  one reviewer put it, "young women and men who formed their political convictions in the fury of the 60's and find themselves gasping for air in the torpor of the 70's, manicurists, singers and students struggling to trim the rhetoric of their wishes to the smaller, tighter fit of reality."         What critics found most striking about Ms. Bambara's fiction, though, were the structure and language she used. Rather than using traditional linear plots, she would often use flashbacks, stream of consciousness and interweavings of plot and subplot to tell a story. She would frequently weave black dialects into her prose, creating a unique, complex language that was widely admired by critics.         Ms. Bambara published one novel, "The Salt Eaters," in 1980. She also edited  several anthologies and wrote several short-story collections, including "Gorilla, My Love," published in 1972, and "The Sea Birds Are Still Alive," published in 1977. Reviewing "Gorilla, My Love" for The New York Times in 1972,  C.D.B. Bryan wrote that her stories were unusual because they addressed racial issues in a tone more thoughtful than angry.         "Toni Cade Bambara tells me more about being black through her quiet, proud,  silly, tender, hip, acute, loving stories than any amount of literary polemicizing could hope to do," Mr. Bryan wrote in the review. "She writes about love: a love for one's family, one's friends, one's race, one's neighborhood, and it is the sort of love that comes with maturity and inner peace."         Ms. Bambara was born in New York City, and growing up, she spent much of her  time in public libraries. Louis Massiah, a friend and colleague in Philadelphia, said that as a child, Ms. Bambara would often visit a Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where she was inspired by two black poets: Gwendolyn Brooks, whose photograph hung there, and Langston Hughes, who she said would often come and talk to children there.         Ms. Bambara graduated from Queens College with a bachelor's degree in theater arts in 1959. In 1965, she received a master's degree in American studies from the City College of New York. She was an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1974, and she also held various teaching positions at Duke University, Atlanta University and Spelman College, among others.         From 1986 until this year, Ms. Bambara taught script writing at Scribe Video  Center in Philadelphia. Mr. Massiah said that during her tenure at the center, she helped start the careers of several black women film makers. She wrote and lectured frequently about film, stressing the importance of movies that dispel Hollywood stereotypes about blacks.         Over the last decade, Ms. Bambara also collaborated with Mr. Massiah on several television documentaries, including "The Bombing of Osage Avenue," about the police assault on Move headquarters in Philadelphia, and a biography of Cecil B. Moore, a prominent civil rights activist in Philadelphia. Her most recent project was a documentary about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois, which she worked on with Mr. Massiah and several others.         Throughout her life, Mr. Massiah said, Ms. Bambara fought for the rights of minorities, women, children and the homeless.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her mother, Helen Brehon of Queens, and a brother, Walter Cade of Queens.       
         Laura Scott Taylor, the co-founder and retired principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, died on Sunday at Kings County Hospital Center. Mrs. Taylor, who lived in Crown Heights, was 79.         Mrs. Taylor was fatally injured when she was hit by a truck last Friday while crossing a street in Crown Heights.         For 32 years, Mrs. Taylor served as the unsalaried principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School, which she established in 1960 with her husband, the Rev. Gardner Taylor, now pastor emeritus of the Concord Baptist Church of Christ.         Dr. Taylor, who had been a member of the New York City Board of Education, said the school was founded because many parents felt their children were being "intellectually butchered" by the public school system. "The kids were finished before their lives had started," he said.         The school emphasizes reading and extensive instruction in black history and culture. "It means a great deal to know Negroes are making a success in every phase of life," Mrs. Taylor said in 1967. "For these children to get a good opinion of themselves is very important. They should know that those who want to make it can."         Begun with 25 pupils in grades one through six, the school reached an enrollment of 130 pupils in seven years.         "We have proved that Negroes can learn to do what anybody else can do," Mrs. Taylor said then. "There is something radically wrong with the public school system if our kids can't read."         Today, the school has an enrollment of 150 in its six grades.         Mrs. Taylor, who was born in Cleveland, grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and graduated in 1937 from Oberlin College. In 1940, after teaching in South Carolina, she married Dr. Taylor, whom she had met at the Mount Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin while he was a student at the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology.         The Taylors moved to New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La., and came to Brooklyn in 1948, when Dr. Taylor was named pastor of the Concord Baptist Church. He retired in 1990 as the dean of black pastors in the United States. In 1952, when the church was destroyed by fire, Mrs. Taylor led its women in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the construction of a replacement.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Taylor is survived by her daughter, Martha LaCroix; a brother, Eugene Scott; a sister, Elizabeth Taylor; a sister by adoption, Ruby Harris, and a grandson.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnomusicologist, writer and the widow of the composer Henry Cowell, died on Thursday at her home in Shady, N.Y., said Sean Hartnett, her executor. She was 92.         In her extensive travels from 1937 to 1957, Mrs. Cowell recorded American, Finnish, Irish, Portuguese, Iranian and Turkish folk music, among other types. Her collection, housed in the Library of Congress, is among the most extensive ever gathered and includes some of the earliest documentation of ethnic music in the United States. It holds not only field recordings, but also correspondence, field notes, photographs, articles and other materials.         She was born in San Francisco in 1903 and received a bachelor of arts in philology and Romance languages from Stanford University in 1924. After graduating, she studied piano in Paris with the pianist and teacher Alfred Cortot.         In 1935-36, she directed the social music program at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. The next year, she worked for the Resettlement Administration (renamed the Farm Security Administration) in Appalachia and the Ozarks, recording black American music in chain-gang road camps.         She met Cowell in 1927 as his piano student. They were married in 1941 and together they traveled as cultural ambassadors for the State Department, collecting music from around the world. After his death in 1965, she became one of the biggest champions of his music.         Mrs. Cowell was also a teacher and writer. She taught courses in American folk music at the University of Southern California, and was an author, with her husband, of "Charles Ives and His Music" (1955).         No immediate family members survive.       
         Vivian Verdell Gordon, who wrote about feminism, black families and affirmative action and who was a professor of black studies at the State University at Albany, died on Wednesday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Lois Smith Owens.         She was the author of 10 books and several articles, a former chairwoman of the department of Africana studies at the university and a poet. Her collection "Dark Women and Others" (Lotus Press, 1983) was published under the name Satiafa.         Born in Washington, she received an undergraduate degree from Virginia State University in 1955, a master's degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Virginia in 1974.         In the 1960's, she worked in Washington for the Library of Congress and the House Committee on Education and Labor. She also worked with the Women's Christian Alliance Child Welfare Agency and the Upward Bound Project in California before she began teaching at the University of Virginia in 1971. She was head of the university's black studies program from 1974 to 1979.         Her book "Black Women, Feminism and Black Liberation" (Third World Press, 1985) described the conflict that black women face over the issues of feminism and racism.         Her marriage to Ronald Gordon ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Ronald Jr., of Atlanta; a brother, Thomas, and a daughter, Susan Akkad, both of New York City.       
         Selena, the 23-year-old reigning queen of the Tejano music world, was shot and killed today at a Corpus Christi motel.         Shortly after 9:30 P.M. a 32-year-old woman identified by the young singer's father as the former president of her fan club abruptly surrendered after keeping the police at bay for nearly 10 hours as she sat in a red pickup truck in the motel parking lot with a gun pointed at her temple.         Hundreds of people who had congregated in the cold drizzle watched as she was rushed off in a police car, surrounded by officers.         The killing of the star, who had won a Grammy music award last year and whose recording "Amor Prohibido" ("Forbidden Love") sold 400,000 copies in the United States and many more than that in Mexico, stunned her fans and prompted almost non-stop coverage on Spanish-language radio and television stations here, in Texas's major cities and all along the Mexican border. Many of the stations took calls from distraught listeners and played Selena's songs throughout the day.         The surrender came in a surreal scene with a crowd of reporters, television camera operators and onlookers gathered at an Exxon gas station across the street from the Days Inn motel just off a stretch of Interstate 37 near the Corpus Christi airport. Hundreds of fans, including many weeping teen-agers, converged on the scene throughout the day, a few with tape machines that played recordings of Selena's songs as reporters' beepers and cellular phones rang almost constantly.         Police identified the suspect as Yolanda Saldivar and said they would charge her on Saturday. The singer's father, Abraham Quintanilla, said Ms. Saldivar was a former head of the Selena fan club who three weeks ago was fired from her job at the family's clothing boutique here, Selena, Etc. The stores are due to expand to San Antonio and Mexico in coming months.         "There have been discrepancies," Mr. Quintanilla told reporters at the hospital where his daughter died this afternoon, two hours after she was shot. "And they resulted in her shooting Selena."         Mr. Quintanilla described Ms. Saldivar as a "disgruntled employee" who was fired after money was discovered to be missing from the store. He said that Selena had demanded that the woman return financial documents about the company and that the two women had agreed to meet at the motel.         With her pouting smile, suggestive clothing and theatrical command of a microphone, Selena was often described as the Madonna of the Mexican-American world and was an idol and heartthrob on both sides of the border. Unlike Madonna, though, she also cultivated an image as a cheerful promoter of family values. She was married to Chris Perez, the lead guitarist in her band, Selena y los Dinos.         Tejano music, which has roots both in the oompah music of European settlers in Texas and in Mexican ballads, is a fast-paced mix of accordion, guitars and lyrics in both English and Spanish.         It is hugely popular in South Texas and elsewhere along the border. The recent Tejano Music Awards in San Antonio, which has become a sort of Nashville of the Tejano world, was attended by 45,000 fans. At the ceremonies, Selena walked away with awards for female entertainer of the year, female vocalist of the year, best record of the year and best album. Her "Selena Live" also won the Grammy last year for best Mexican-American album.         "It's got polka in it, a little bit of country, a little bit of jazz," she said in an interview last year with the San Jose Mercury News. "Fuse all those types of music together. I think that's where you get Tejano."         Selena's hit "Fotos y Recuerdos" ("Photographs and Memories") is No. 4 on Billboard Magazine's Latin chart this week.         An assistant police chief in Corpus Christi, Ken Bung, said that Selena, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla Perez, was shot in a room at the motel just before noon and stumbled to the lobby. She was rushed to the Memorial Medical Center and pronounced dead about an hour later.         Born in Lake Jackson, near Houston, on April 16, 1971, Selena began singing with her father's band at age 3. The family later moved to Corpus Christi where she became well-known in local music circles by her teen-age years and eventually became a widely known star.         At the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a traditional celebration that turns America's fourth-largest city into a cowtown once a year, Selena was the largest-selling draw this year.         "We had 20 performances this year," said Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show. "We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome."         A concert video made of her performance is to air shortly in Mexico and on some Spanish-language stations in Texas.         Maria Aguirre, a receptionist at KQQK, a popular Tejano music station in Houston, said the switchboard had been flooded with calls since the death was first announced.         "Basically they are just in awe," Ms. Aguirre said. "They cannot believe that it happened. They're calling to reconfirm."         For Tejano fans, she added, "It's almost like the feeling when John Lennon died. She was the queen of Tejano."         Mr. Shafer said: "This lady was destined to be an international superstar. In many aspects she already was. She could sell out any pavilion in South Texas. She was on her way to standing beside Madonna."         In Mexico, her popularity was limited more to the northern border region, within what Mexicans call the onda grupera, or "group wave," a movement of norteno or "ranchera" pop groups that travel the northern and central states of the country, playing dances in the towns and concerts in the cities.         Selena's father had toured nightclubs across Texas in the 1960's with the original version of Los Dinos but did not achieve wide success until he made young Selena, with her belting vocal power, the lead singer. "I think he saw dollar signs," Selena said laughingly in an interview last year, describing the evolution of a family band that included her sister Suzette on drums and her brother Abraham III on guitar.         Industry experts estimated that the shooting would only ripen Selena's celebrity as the Tejano queen who was about to break through to a larger public with her first English language album as well as her first movie role in the forthcoming "Don Juan DeMarco."         "That album was going to open a lot of doors," said John Ortiz, promotion representative for EMI Latin Records. "It will be a great loss. Shewas involved in many things."       
         Jo Sinclair, who wrote about the struggles of immigrant families in America, died on April 4 at her home in Jenkintown, Pa. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, said Joan Soffer, her companion.         Ms. Sinclair, whose original name was Ruth Seid, was born in Brooklyn and moved to Cleveland with her family when she was 3 years old. She later used her adolescent and family experiences as the basis for her best-known works, "Wasteland" (1946) and "The Changelings" (1955). The former, about a first-generation American Jew who rejects his immigrant roots, won the Harper Prize Novel Award in 1946 and brought the author her first measure of fame as well as a $10,000 prize. "The Changelings" dealt with racial tensions in a changing city neighborhood and the friendship between two teen-age girls, one black, one white.         She was also the author of "Sing at My Wake" (1951), "Anna Teller" (1960), and a 1993 memoir titled "The Seasons: Death and Transfiguration." Her work also appeared in magazines and journals and was widely anthologized.         In addition to Ms. Soffer, she is survived by a sister, Fannie Stein of Cleveland.       
         Yvette Hawkins, a stage, film and television actress, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 54.         The cause was lung cancer, the hospital said.         Ms. Hawkins appeared on Broadway in "The Amen Corner," "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death" and "Checkmates." Her Off Broadway credits included "The Strong Breed," "The Trials of Brother Jero," "The Resurrection of Lady Lester," "The Last Street Play" and "Before It Hits Home."         She also acted in regional theater, appearing in productions by the Philadelphia Drama Guild, the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the Intiman Theater in Seattle.         Her films include "Nighthawks," "Lean on Me," "Mississippi Masala" and "Zebrahead." Television viewers saw her in "As the World Turns," "Cagney and Lacey," "Guiding Light" and "Law and Order.         Ms. Hawkins also was a co-writer of "A Guide to the Black Apple" and a writer for the Children's Television Workshop.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Maggie Kuhn, who called herself a little old woman and celebrated her forced retirement in 1970 by founding the Gray Panthers, died yesterday at the home she shared in Philadelphia with a like-minded coterie. She was 89.         "She died peacefully in her sleep," said her personal assistant, Sue Leary, who could not say which of Miss Kuhn's many ailments, from arthritis to osteoporosis, had caused her death.         For all Miss Kuhn's ailments, none had slowed her down. She spent the last 25 years leading people young and old in the fight against age discrimination and other forms of what she saw as social injustice and stereotypical thinking and just two weeks ago she had joined striking transit workers on their picket line.         Even so, there was some evidence that Miss Kuhn knew that the end was coming. Although she had made it her goal to live until her 90th birthday, in August, she had allowed her friends and admirers to celebrate it on April 1. And in a recent issue of the Gray Panthers' publication, The Network, she had lectured the organization's 40,000 members in 32 states on the need to prepare for the 21st century.         It was hardly the first time Miss Kuhn had been ahead of her time.         It was in 1970 that Miss Kuhn, who had worked 25 years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 and was forced to leave her job.         "They gave me a sewing machine," she once recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy."         Within months of her retirement, she joined several friends in founding an organization quickly dubbed the Gray Panthers, a name derived from the radical Black Panthers.         Despite the name and the initial emphasis on championing the elderly, as conceived by Miss Kuhn the organization knew no age boundaries. Its credo described it simply as an advocate for "fundamental social change that would eliminate injustice, discrimination and oppression in our present society."         For example, in addition to seeking a ban on mandatory retirement, which was eventually enacted into law, the group called for "publicly owned and democratically controlled" utilities.         No one who knew Miss Kuhn was surprised that in last year's health care debate her organization championed what was widely seen as the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government, a position that had been on the Gray Panthers' official agenda since 1977.         A tiny woman who wore her hair in a prim bun that gave her the look of an ideal candidate to be helped across the street by a Boy Scout, Miss Kuhn, who detested the term "senior citizen," made no apologies for her looks or her age.         "I'm an old woman," she told The New York Times in 1972. "I have gray hair, many wrinkles and arthritis in both hands. And I celebrate my freedom from bureaucratic restraints that once held me."         Miss Kuhn, whose opposition to the war in Vietnam made her a hero to many young protesters, had a disarming argument in recruiting younger people to her cause: "Everyone of us is growing old."         Known as an inspirational speaker, Miss Kuhn was just as persuasive in private conversation, combining honey with the hammer.         "Forceful, yet gracious" is the way Miss Leary put it yesterday.         Miss Kuhn was a champion of social causes long before the Gray Panthers.         As she noted in her 1991 autobiography, "No Stone Unturned," (Ballantine) she was conceived in Memphis, where her father, a traveling district manage for Dunn & Bradstreet, was working at the time. But her mother, refusing to deliver a child into a racist society, insisted on returning to her home in Buffalo to give birth.         As a student at Flora Stone Mather College of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Miss Kuhn helped organize a college chapter of the League of Women Voters.         And in a succession of jobs as a manager of social programs for the Young Women's Christian Association in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Boston and in similar work with the Presbyterian Church in New York, Miss Kuhn took what were then unconventional positions on issues like peace and social justice.         Miss Kuhn, who could also be somewhat unconventional in her private life, attributed the fact that she had never married to "sheer luck."         According to her book, she had many love affairs, including one in her 70's with a student in his 20's. Miss Kuhn did not identify him, but Christina Long, who helped her with the book, said the man, now in his 40's, was at the recent birthday gala. "He seemed very proud of the romance," she said.         Miss Kuhn leaves no immediate survivors.
