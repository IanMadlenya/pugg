She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Siskind was a founder of the Bronx Women's Bar in the early 1930's, before women were admitted to the men's bar association. She was its president for two decades, during which she was an active trial and appellate lawyer. Women were admitted to the Bronx Bar Association in 1945, and Mrs. Siskind served as its president from 1970 to 1971. She was appointed to the Mayor's Judiciary Committee by John V. Lindsay in the late 1960's and re-appointed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame. She retired in 1978.         Mrs. Siskind was born in Mogilev in Byelorussia and came to the United States as a child. She studied at Hunter College and graduated from New York University Law School in 1923.

Huser Jr. of North Palm Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Eleanor H. Kirk of Bronxville, N.Y.; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
        Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         With her eye for the new and the lively, Mrs. Varian was best known in New York for the provocative shows of avant-garde art that she organized in the 1960's and 1970's as director of the contemporary wing of the Finch College Museum of Art. Among the more notable were a series called ''Art in Process,'' staged over an 11-year period ending in 1973, which exposed in detail the working methods and techniques of a number of contemporary artists; two ''Projected Art'' exhibitions of experimental films, videotapes and documentaries of artists at work; two Art Deco shows noted for scholarship and selectivity, and a documentary film by the artist Les Levine that portrayed the civil strife in northern Ireland. Mrs. Varian also taught courses in museology and art history at Finch.         Elayne Hanley was born in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1913. She was graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and later received a master's degree in fine art there. She came to New York in 1933 and worked for a while as a dress designer. She married John Varian, a lawyer, in 1936, and retired to raise their son.         In the mid-1940's, she joined the Duveen Brothers gallery, where she became assistant to the president, Edward Fowles, and remained there for 15 years. She went to Finch College as director of its contemporary museum in 1964, a position she held until the college closed for lack of funds in 1975.         In that year, Mrs. Varian moved to Orlando, where her husband had retired. For three years, she served as curator of contemporary art at the John and Mabel Ringling Museum in Sarasota. After leaving there in 1978, she did art appraisal work and mounted several shows as a freelance curator.         She is survived by her husband and by a son, Alfred, of Stowe, Vt.       
        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.         Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.         In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.         She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.         Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.         Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.         Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.       
        Mary Elizabeth Mann, a property-tax lawyer and president of the Tax Commission of New York City since March 1978, died of cancer Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and also had a home on Shelter Island, L.I.         Mary Elizabeth Mann, a property-tax lawyer and president of the Tax Commission of New York City since March 1978, died of cancer Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and also had a home on Shelter Island, L.I.         Ms. Mann, the first woman to become president of the Tax Commission, was among Mayor Koch's first-term appointments.         She was the only full-time commissioner on the seven-member panel, which resolves disputes between the city and its taxpayers. The commission reviews complaints about real-property assessments, adjusts those where warranted and grants or denies exemptions. Left Post Several Weeks Ago         Ms. Mann, who was known as Bettie, remained at her post until several weeks ago, her associates say. On April 2, Mayor Koch went to her apartment to present her with a medal for outstanding service to the city.         She came to her post after serving as director of legal services for the New York State Board of Equalization and Assessment in Albany, which solves property-tax problems statewide. She earned a reputation there as a superb lawyer and researcher, an evenhanded mediator and an authority in her field.         Ms. Mann was born in Pine Bluff, Ark., and grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla. She graduated from Vassar College and, in 1948, from the Vanderbilt University Law School, where she was an editor of the Vanderbilt Law Review.         She worked as a consultant for the State Board of Equalization, and joined the staff and became director of legal services in 1976. A member of the bar in New York State and Florida, she also lectured at the New York University School of Continuing Education.         Ms. Mann is survived by her brother, Sam H. Mann Jr. of St. Petersburg.         Services are to be held at 1 P.M. Tuesday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Madison Avenue at 81st Street.         MARY E. MANN IS DEAD AT 63       
        Lucille Edwards Chance, a lawyer and the second black woman admitted to the New York bar, died in her home yesterday after a long illness. She was 88 years old and lived in Harlem.         Lucille Edwards Chance, a lawyer and the second black woman admitted to the New York bar, died in her home yesterday after a long illness. She was 88 years old and lived in Harlem.         Mrs. Chance, a graduate of Hunter College and New York University Law School, began practicing law in 1933, first with the firm of Chance & Gray, then with Chance, Gray & Rohlehr and finally, with Chance & White. Mrs. Chance, who was admitted to the New York bar after Ruth Whitehead Whaley, the first black woman to join, retired in 1980.         In 1922, a year after she arrived in this country from Georgetown, British Guiana, now Guyana, Mrs. Chance founded the Edwards, Owens Employment Agency, which specialized in finding jobs for people from the Caribbean. That year she also became a senior partner in her family's real estate firm, Edwards Sisters Realty Associates, now the oldest black-owned real estate firm in New York.         From 1948 to 1968, Mrs. Chance was the president of the Harlem Taxpayers and Property Owners Association. She was a director of Freedom National Bank from 1966 to 1971, a member of the New York State Electoral College in 1968 and the president of the Inner City Housing and Development Council from 1972 to 1980.         Mrs. Chance's first husband was the late Dr. Edmund A. Rohlehr. Their son, John A. Rohlehr, a lawyer and commissioner of the State Liquor Authority, died in 1962. Her second husband, Dr. Albion Chance, died in 1955. She is survived by her sister, Sarah Edwards Gray, of Harlem; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         Funeral services will be held at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, 230 Lenox Avenue, at 122d Street, on Saturday at 11 A.M.       
        A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.         A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.         The woman, Juana Leija, entered the pleas as part of an agreement in which three charges of attempted capital murder were dismissed, her lawyer said.         The lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Mrs. Leija's 10-year probation called for her to remain under the care of Harris County Mental Health and Mental Retardation officials.         ''They agreed that she was mentally ill at the time that it happened,'' he said. ''She knows that at the time it happened she thought what she was doing was right.''         Mrs. Leija, 30 years old, said at the time the world was a terrible place, and that her children would be better off dead.         The prosecutor, Carol Davies, said probation was too light a sentence.         ''There are a lot of women out there in difficult circumstances with children, and I would hate to think that anyone would think that this is an appropriate way to solve your problems,'' Ms. Davies said. Two of Mrs. Leija's children, 5-year-old Juana and 6-year-old Judas Dimas, drowned in the muddy waters of the bayou on April 18, 1986, but nearby workers heard the childrens' screams and rescued the other four.       
        Daisy C. Schapiro, a lawyer and an early advocate of child care for working parents in New York, died of natural causes Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         Daisy C. Schapiro, a lawyer and an early advocate of child care for working parents in New York, died of natural causes Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Schapiro was a founder in the late 1930's of the All Day Neighborhood Schools program. The program, with the help of such settlement houses as the Hudson Guild, helped to educate the children of working parents during and after regular school hours.         She was the chairwoman of the Little Red School House and the Elisabeth Irwin High School in Manhattan, and the founder and chairwoman of the associates of the New School for Social Research.         Mrs. Schapiro was born in Manhattan and received a law degree from the Brooklyn Law School in 1923.         Her husband, Jacob Schapiro, also a lawyer, died in 1958.         She is survived by a son, Seth L. Schapiro of Manhattan, and a daughter, Cherry S. Krassner of New Rochelle; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
        Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Born in the Clasons Point section of the East Bronx, she held the borough's at-large seat on the Council for more than 17 years. A Democrat, she had been a teacher in the city's school system and had served three and a half terms in the State Legislature before her election to the Council in 1965.         Her political career, which ended in 1983 when the at-large Council seats were abolished, was devoted largely to education and consumer causes. At budget time she often tangled with the Koch administration over what she considered to be meager funds for the public libraries. Author of Food Laws         Her legislative triumphs included the sponsorship of a law to require dairies to place dates on their milk cartons. Another law she sponsored mandated that supermarkets must list unit prices as well as package prices.         As chairwoman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, she was at the center of some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's. She was chairwoman of a series of long public hearings on proposals to require all-male private clubs to admit women.         Her position on measures that sought to guarantee the civil rights of the city's homosexuals was equivocal at times, but her handling of the issue enhanced her reputation as a skilled parliamentarian. In 1978 she scheduled hearings on the rights bill the day after the November election, leading to accusations by proponents of the bill that she had chosen a day when the public and news media would be absorbed in other matters.         On another crucial occasion the bill was stalled in the Welfare Committee when she failed to return from lunch for an important vote, even though supporters of the bill were counting on her vote. Elected to Assembly         Mrs. Ryan went into politics after her husband, E. Gerard Ryan, a lawyer, died. Only a handful of women had served in the New York State Assembly when she was elected to the Legislature in 1958.         She was active in Bronx politics in her 10 years as a teacher, and she was a former vice president of the Siwanoy Democratic Club, now defunct. She was a charter member of the Bronx Historical Society and a member of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ryan was also a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Business and Professional Women's Club of New York and the Order of Our Lady of the Holy Sepulchre.         Born Aileen Barlow, she attended Public School 47 in the Bronx, Cathederal High School, Hunter College and the New York University Law School. Manhattan College awarded an honorary doctorate to her in 1974.         She was a lifelong resident of the Bronx until she moved to Point Lookout, L.I., about two years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Gerald Ryan of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Francis X. Ryan of Muttontown, L.I.; a daughter, Allana Chesney of Point Lookout, and three grandchildren.         A wake will be held today and tomorrow from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M. at O'Shea's Funeral Home in Wantagh, L.I. A funeral mass is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. Wednesday at St. Helena's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx.

She was 98 years old and lived in Ghent, N.Y.         Mrs. Oberwager received bachelor's and master's degrees in law from New York University in 1909 and 1910 and, in later years, studied at Fordham University. She was admitted to the bar in 1916.         She and her husband, the late Charles A. Oberwager, a New York City magistrate, were law partners.         She is survived by a son, Edwin, of Ghent, a retired Supreme Court justice; a daughter, Elaine Johnson of Somers, N.Y., three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
        Victoria Kent, the first woman to become a lawyer in Spain and the founder and former editor of Iberica, a magazine that opposed both communism in Spain and the Government of Franco, died last Friday of a heart attack at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had lived in Manhattan for the last 37 years.         Victoria Kent, the first woman to become a lawyer in Spain and the founder and former editor of Iberica, a magazine that opposed both communism in Spain and the Government of Franco, died last Friday of a heart attack at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had lived in Manhattan for the last 37 years.         Born in Malaga, Spain, in 1897, she spent her youth in Madrid, where she studied at the University of Madrid. She was the first woman to argue before the Spanish Royal Tribunal of Law, where she successfully defended rebel leaders.         After the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy in 1931, the leaders of the Spanish Republican Government placed her in charge of reforming the country's prison system. During the Spanish Civil War, she worked in Paris, aiding refugees from Spain.         When German forces occupied Paris during World War II, Miss Kent sought refuge in the Embassy of Mexico. After the liberation of Paris, she moved to Mexico, where she lectured on penal law at the University of Mexico.         In 1950, she moved to New York City, where she worked for the United Nations and established Iberica.         Earlier this year, she was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of San Raimundo of Penafort by the King of Spain.         Miss Kent is survived by a nephew, Jose Maria O'Kean of Seville, Spain.

        Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Miss Monroe, the official soloist for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spent much of her career singing the national anthem. She once estimated that she had sung it more than 5,000 times. In 1940 she starred in ''The American Jubilee'' at the New York World's Fair, closing each of 650 performances with the anthem. She sang for Presidents Roosevelt, Johnson and Kennedy, at President Truman's inauguration and at hundreds of other civic and patriotic gatherings.         In 1942, she conducted a community sing, sponsored by the Treasury Department, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. More than 40,000 people attended. During the next four years the Treasury and RCA Victor co-sponsored similar events nationwide to sell war bonds. Anthem Sometimes Barred         On some occasions, however, Miss Monroe refused to sing the song with which she had become so closely identified. When she performed for American troops, she did not sing the national anthem because, she said, ''the men are living it.''         Miss Monroe, who was born on Oct. 23, 1906, in New York, was the daughter of Anna Laughlin and Dwight Monroe, a diamond importer. She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School.         During the 1930's she was featured on three commercial radio programs a week and was a co-star for four years with Frank Munn on NBC's ''American Album of Familiar Music.'' She also appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras and with the Chicago, St. Louis and Metropolitan Opera companies.         Miss Monroe married Harold M. Weinberg, a New York lawyer, in 1961, and was widowed in 1977. She leaves no survivors.         A memorial service will be held at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets.
