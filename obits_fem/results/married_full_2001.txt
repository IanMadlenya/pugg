         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose stewardship of the Brearley School and then Barnard College made her a national role model for generations of young women who wanted to combine career and family, died on Wednesday at her home in Tyringham, Mass. She was 102.         An outspoken feminist in the 1940's and 50's before feminism became popular, Mrs. McIntosh was the first married woman to head one of the seven top women's colleges known as the Seven Sisters and became a national icon.         ''She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president, said at a gathering in 1998 at the McIntosh Student Center to mark Mrs. McIntosh's centennial birthday. She said Mrs. McIntosh, a campus legend, was a pioneer in exploring ''the struggle of both women and men to find their true roles in a changing world.''         Leora Hanser, Barnard student government president at the time of the celebration, said Mrs. McIntosh ''came from a different era, but the work and family issue is really very important, and a lot of Barnard students struggle with this today.''         In her long career, Mrs. McIntosh spoke and lectured widely, spreading ideas about women, education and child-rearing that would become popular 20 or 30 years later.         ''Having both a job and a family broadens one's perspective, which in turn makes a great contribution to a happy home life,'' she told the American Association of University Women in 1950.         She called for child care to be elevated to a dignified profession so working mothers could leave children in capable hands. And she attacked the conditioning that led young girls to feel they must subordinate their own interests when they were with boys, or to use the ''foolish technique'' of pretending they were stupid to be popular.         For anyone doubting that it could be done, Mrs. McIntosh was also the ultimate role model as she juggled marriage, five children (including twins) and her own career. Newsweek magazine viewed that as so remarkable that it put her on its cover in 1951.         But Mrs. McIntosh was less didactic than some later feminists. Even as she urged young women to participate in politics and community service and careers, she warned them that combining career and family meant pushing out nearly everything else. And she portrayed family life as a cornerstone of society and democracy, adding that in the face of conflict, family must take precedence.         ''You must be prepared to sacrifice many of your social contacts until your family is full grown,'' she said, ''and must always remember that your home comes before all else.''         She also respected the idea that happiness could come in many ways. Personal fulfillment ''may or may not lie in a career,'' she told The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. ''What is important is for each individual to order her life so that she becomes a happy, creative person.''         Her approach to life was rooted in common sense and a lack of pretense, physically and intellectually. A small, trim woman, she often wore plain suits without decoration. As a college president, she swept her own vestibule and weeded her own garden. And when she was honored after 10 years as chief of Barnard, she agreed on the condition that there be no speeches, no gifts and no flowers.         She also disliked honorifics. She preferred ''Mrs.'' to Dean and was often referred to as ''Mrs. Mac.'' When Barnard officials referred to her in news releases as ''Dr.,'' she chided them, saying, ''There is only one doctor in our family,'' referring to her husband, Dr. Rustin McIntosh, a pediatrician who taught at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.         Mrs. McIntosh saw education in its broadest sense, from conjugating irregular Greek verbs to sex education, as the way to prepare young women for the complicated balancing act she was urging on them. She believed that the education of young women for motherhood was society's ''most important task.''         At a time when few women were represented in the boardrooms of major American corporations, Mrs. McIntosh was a director of several companies, schools, foundations and civic groups.         After her retirement in 1962, she and her husband moved to their farm in Tyringham, Mass. Her husband died in 1986. Mrs. McIntosh is survived by a daughter, Susan Lloyd of Tinmouth, Vt.; 4 sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich., R. Carey, of Tyringham, Kenneth of West Newton, Mass., and J. Richard, of Boulder, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.         Millicent Carey McIntosh was born on Nov. 30, 1898, in Baltimore, the daughter of Anthony Morris Carey, who ran a machinery supply business, and the former Margaret Cheston Thomas, both active Quakers. She had five brothers and sisters, and all were taught to mend and darn and market and cook.         Her feminist notions were shaped by strong role models in her family. Her mother fought for women's suffrage, racial equality and prison reform. Her aunt, M. Carey Thomas, was a pioneer in women's education, a founder of the Bryn Mawr School (a girls' school in Baltimore) and president of Bryn Mawr College.         At Bryn Mawr, young Millicent played water polo and basketball and majored in Greek and English, graduating magna cum laude. She organized clubs for factory workers before accepting her aunt's offer of a year of study abroad.         After studying economics at Cambridge and English at Johns Hopkins University (where she did her doctoral thesis on 14th-century English mystery dramas), Mrs. McIntosh became an instructor at Bryn Mawr College. But she quickly was appointed dean of freshmen and then acting dean of the college.         She left Bryn Mawr to became headmistress at the Brearley School, the private girls school in Manhattan, from 1930 to 1947, and converted it from a half-day format to a full day. When she arrived, she asked her students to help plan the ''ideal school'' with the fewest possible rules. She worked without a desk because she felt that a desk intimated students. She introduced aptitude tests and remedial instruction and instituted a sex education course for sixth graders, which she taught.         In 1932, after she married Dr. McIntosh, her aunt discouraged her retirement, telling her, ''You can have your babies in August.'' At Brearley, she had five children. (She took to wearing academic robes to cover pregnancies.)         She was a hands-on manager, both at school and at home. She left detailed instructions for her household: menus, shopping lists, activities for the children. And every morning, she called Brearley to specify a hymn for morning assembly.         In late 1946, before Barnard had its own president (she was given the title in 1952), Mrs. McIntosh was chosen from more than 60 candidates to succeed Virginia Gildersleeve as Barnard's dean. It was a life that left few free minutes, but Mrs. McIntosh grabbed every one. She signed correspondence during intermissions at concerts and took her secretary with her to the beauty parlor so she could give dictation.         An administrator who valued good teaching, Mrs. McIntosh was dismayed that teachers were paid less than secretaries and dedicated some of Barnard's endowment for faculty salaries.         She also valued merit, and directed another part of the Barnard endowment to scholarships to open Barnard's doors to ''still more girls of superior talent regardless of their ability to pay.''         As she balanced career and home, Mrs. McIntosh acknowledged both her husband's support and good household help (which at one point included a governess, a cook and two daily helpers). She also respected the individuality of her children, keeping each in a separate school until one year, after attending five separate Christmas pageants, she said, ''I thought if I heard one more 'Silent Night' I would break down.'' Their schooling was consolidated.         At Barnard, she continued to teach: English and modern living, a required class that sought to help students think through their lives. She also presided over a $10 million fund-raising campaign.         John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rarely contributed to development funds, agreed to give Barnard $1 million, he told Mrs. McIntosh, ''because of my confidence in the exceptional vision and leadership you are bringing to the college.''         Even after she retired from Barnard, the trustees continued to consult her. In 1971, when men's and women's colleges everywhere were going coeducational and Barnard was facing pressure to merge into Columbia, Barnard's chairwoman, Eleanor Elliott, turned to Mrs. McIntosh, who suggested that the trustees try to answer three questions: Would a merger produce better education for Barnard and Columbia? Would relations between Barnard women and Columbia men be improved? And would a merger create economies for both colleges?         ''Mrs. Mac's questions helped organize our thinking simply and calmly,'' Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, ''and of course, we felt stronger.''       
         Linda Eder Jamieson Storrow, a former actress, magazine executive and official New York City greeter for the State of New York who was  host for 13 years of a radio program  celebrating those she called ''splendid seniors,'' died at her Manhattan apartment on Jan. 6. She was 90.         The program, called ''Looking Forward'' for its final seven years from 1991 to 1998, when it was broadcast on WYNE in New York, took up  topics from affordable housing to octogenarian sex to tap-dancing in one's 90's. For its first six years, it was called ''What Keeps Us Going'' and was broadcast starting in 1985 by In Touch Networks.         Linda Eder was born in Manhattan on Dec. 11, 1910. Her father was a lawyer whose family owned a large sugar mill in Cali, Colombia, where she spent part of her youth. At the Lincoln School, she developed a passion for acting. She made a bargain with her father that she would attend Skidmore College for one year if she could then leave school to become an actress. She became part of the company of Walter Hampton, a prominent Shakespearean actor, and also had a small part in the Broadway production of ''Cynara,'' which opened in 1931, before her father strongly discouraged her from acting because she might be taking jobs from poor people.         In 1940, she married Francis A. Jamieson, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1933 for his coverage of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.         When Mr. Jamieson worked as an aide to Nelson Rockefeller in the State Department, she returned to acting for a year, playing a villainess in a radio soap opera broadcast in Washington. As Mr. Jamieson went on to play a prominent role in Mr. Rockefeller's campaign for governor in 1958, she taught reading and acting to poor children as a volunteer. Mr. Jamieson died in 1960. Governor Rockefeller appointed her the state's official greeter of foreign dignitaries in New York City.         In 1962, she married James J. Storrow III, who became publisher of The Nation magazine in 1967. In 1973, he named her associate publisher. She also wrote articles and served as its United Nations observer.         The Storrows turned the magazine over to its next publisher, Hamilton Fish III, in January 1978. Mr. Storrow died in 1984.         She is survived by her daughters, Margot Witty of Manhattan and Frances Jamieson Unger of Silver Spring, Md.; two stepdaughters, Joan-Ellen Jamieson Zucker of Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Margaret Storrow of Brookline, Mass; three stepsons, Gerald Storrow of Somerville, Mass., Peter Storrow of the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, and James Storrow of Stormville, N.Y.; seven grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandson.       
         Vera Constantinova, a princess of Russia long active in Russian-American emigre circles and charitable organizations, died on Jan. 11 at the Tolstoy Foundation Center in Valley Cottage, N.Y. She was 94.         Princess Vera was born near St. Petersburg, a daughter of Grand Duke Constantine and Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. She was a great-granddaughter of Nicholas I, czar from 1825 to 1855.         Many of her relatives were killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, but she and her mother escaped to Sweden. Eventually they settled in Altenburg, seat of the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, in Thuringia, eastern Germany.         At the end of World War II, Princess Vera fled again before the advancing Soviet Army. She came to the United States in 1951 to live in New York and work for organizations like the Tolstoy Foundation, which was formed to help Russian refugees.         Princess Vera never married.       
         Beverley Peck Johnson, a noted voice teacher and a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School of Music since 1964, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Johnson was a highly trusted and notably successful voice teacher, as the long list of eminent singers who studied with her bears out. Among her students from Juilliard were Renee Fleming, Faith Esham, Anthony Dean Griffey and Robert White. The roster of singers who came to her studio for private coaching includes Renata Tebaldi, Anna Moffo, Evelyn Lear, Giorgio Tozzi, Mignon Dunn, Theodor Uppman and Phyllis Bryn-Julson. Though she provided solid grounding in basic vocal technique, Ms. Johnson was particularly valued by students for a keen ability to find individual solutions to their problems.         Many good voice teachers play the piano well enough to accompany their students in lessons, but Ms. Johnson was one of the few who worked periodically as a professional accompanist, playing for, among others, Martha Atwood and Sigurd Nilssen. Several of her students became prominent accompanists and voice coaches, including Margot Garrett, Brian Zeger and Ken Noda.         Ms. Johnson, who kept her age secret from friends and colleagues, was born in Portland, Ore., on June 12, 1904, to Hartwig O. and Cecilia W. Peck. When she was young, her family moved to Walla Walla, Wash., where she was brought up. She studied at the White Conservatory in Portland, where she pursued a double major in drama and speech. As a young woman she moved to New York and polished her skills as an accompanist in lessons with the conductor Andre Kostelanetz. Some years later she studied voice with the tenor Hardesty Johnson, whom she married and with whom she toured as an accompanist. Her husband died in 1952.         Ms. Johnson also served on the faculty of the School of Sacred Music, Union Theological Seminary (1960-65), and the Manhattan School of Music (1982-1989), and was an adjunct professor at the Conservatory of Music, Brooklyn College.         Given her background in drama, Ms. Johnson was sought out by several prominent actors for voice lessons and coaching, including Madeline Kahn, Kevin Klein, Constance Towers, Tammy Grimes and Blythe Danner. When, during his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson was recuperating from surgery to remove some vocal nodules, Ms. Johnson was summoned to his ranch in Texas to serve as a post-operative speech coach.         Ms. Johnson has no immediate survivors. No photograph of her was discovered in her files at Juilliard or her New York apartment, friends said. Besides keeping her age a secret, Ms. Johnson adamantly refused to have her picture taken.       
         Chrissie Collins, who with her husband devised and promoted what became the MedicAlert bracelet as a way to provide emergency medical information, died on Jan. 8 in Turlock, Calif. She was 94.         The concept of jewelry that could alert emergency personnel to allergies and other critical information, as well as provide a toll-free phone number for details, was born in a family emergency. In 1953, Mrs. Collins and her husband, Marion, were vacationing away from Turlock, in the Central Valley of California, when their daughter Linda, a high school sophomore, cut her finger while playing with an air rifle. She was taken to a hospital, where she had a violent reaction to a small amount of tetanus antitoxin and spent three days in an oxygen tent.         The situation was grave. Though she had received expert care from a doctor who was her uncle in an excellent hospital founded by her grandfather, she almost died because nobody knew about her allergy. Her father, a physician like his own father, sought to protect her afterward by pinning a piece of paper to her clothing saying, ''Fatally allergic to tetanus antitoxin.''         As Linda approached college, she tired of the safety pins and hotly rejected her father's suggestion that a tattoo might fit the bill.         ''She said, 'Dad, why don't you fix me some sort of bracelet?' '' Mrs. Collins said in an interview with The Los Angeles Daily News in 1998.         Dr. Collins designed the first bracelet, using the well-known medical symbol of the caduceus, two snakes wrapped around a winged staff. He placed the words ''Medic Alert'' alongside the emblem and listed his daughter's medical condition on the back.         A local jeweler fabricated that bracelet, which is now in the National Museum of Natural History's Science, Medicine and Society Collection, although it is not currently on display. The museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution.         ''Other people saw it and said, 'I ought to have one of those. I am allergic,' or 'I have a daughter with diabetes,' '' Linda told The Los Angeles Times in 1978. ''We began having them made up, one at a time.''         The family mailed literature about the bracelet to hospitals and law enforcement agencies throughout the United States and Canada. Some suggested adding a method to obtain additional information.         So the family developed a system by which emergency personnel could telephone 24 hours a day to get information. The first switchboard was that of the hospital where Linda had been taken for her injury.         Ever more volunteers came forward. In 1956, the MedicAlert Foundation was formed.         Things really took off after June 6, 1960, when This Week magazine, which appeared every Sunday in 40 large newspapers, published an article on MedicAlert. Within days, there were 100,000 orders for bracelets. Mrs. Collins remembered ''the whole town of Turlock'' working out of her family room to enroll new members and ship bracelets.         Tanya J. Glazebrook, president and chief executive of the foundation, said that MedicAlert had grown to more than four million bracelet-wearing members and that at least 80,000 lives were believed to have been saved by its efforts. People pay $35 to join and a $15 annual fee.         Chrissie Woolcock was born on July 30, 1906, in Douglas on the Isle of Mann in the British Isles. In 1912, she and her family immigrated to Turlock, where she attended local schools. She graduated from the University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif.         She thought briefly about moving to San Francisco. ''But then, I thought, I couldn't go to the opera or a play every night and I'd get tired of shopping,'' she said in an interview with The Modesto Bee in 1996. ''I thought my friends are more important, and I've always been glad that I stayed.''         In 1928, she married Marion Carter Collins, whom she had met in the eighth grade. She was the Turlock High School adult education choral director and later became involved in the Boy and Girl Scouts and local organizations and charities.         Her husband died in 1977. She is survived by her daughters, Margaret Gilbert of South Beach, Ore., and Linda Maurer of Turlock; her sons, Michael of Denton, Tex., and Thomas of Plattsville, Wis.; eight grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.         Ms. Glazebrook said Mrs. Collins was a MedicAlert board member almost until her death. She asked pointed questions about operations and was particularly fascinated by the foundation's huge computer operation. For her 90th birthday, she was given her own personal computer, and she frequently sent e-mail.       
         Elizabeth Meyer Lorentz, a movie scriptwriter and author of a book on networking, died on Saturday at a hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 87 and lived in Rye, N.Y.         The cause was pneumonia, said her sister Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post who is chairman of the Post Company's executive committee. Mrs. Lorentz's father, Eugene Meyer, bought The Post in 1933.         Mrs. Lorentz, who lived in a nursing home in Rye, formerly lived in Armonk, N.Y. She attended Vassar and Barnard Colleges. She then worked in movie scriptwriting, the field in which she met the documentary maker Pare Lorentz, whom she married. Mr. Lorentz died in 1992.         Mrs. Lorentz is survived by two stepchildren, Pare Lorentz Jr., of Frankfort, Ky., and Tilly Grey of Eastham, Mass.; two sisters, Mrs. Graham, who lives in Washington, and Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.       
         The last queen of Italy, Maria José of Savoy, who served after World War II for only 27 days before Italians voted to abolish the monarchy, died on Saturday in a Geneva hospital. She was 94.         The daughter of Albert I, king of Belgium, Maria José in 1930 married Prince Umberto II, whose father, King Vittorio Emanuele III, cooperated with Mussolini before and during World War II.         Maria José was a little less pliant to the Fascist dictatorship, refusing to Italianize her name to Maria Giuseppina even after Mussolini made it a rule. Italians, who called her the ''rebel queen,'' described her as a closet anti-Fascist. When she fled Rome for Switzerland after Mussolini's fall in 1943, she reportedly told friends that she regretted not having joined Italian Partisans who fought to oust the Germans.         After the war, Maria José became queen on May 9, 1946, when Vittorio Emanuele abdicated in favor of his son, hoping that the gesture would keep the monarchy alive. It did not.  Italians could not forgive the royal family for its early support of Mussolini or for fleeing Rome in 1943 when he was overthrown and Italy changed sides and declared war on Germany.         Two years after a referendum that abolished the monarchy, Italy passed a law banning all male members of the Savoy family from setting foot in Italy. It is still in force, despite lobbying and legal challenges by Maria José's oldest son, Vittorio Emanuele, and her grandson, Emanuele Filiberto, the current heir to the throne.         Umberto and Maria José moved to Portugal even before the results of the referendum were made known, and she left her husband after a year and set up home in an 18th-century villa near Geneva, where members of the ousted dynasty spent their exile. Umberto died in 1983.         She will be buried next to her husband in Hauntecombe Abbey, in France, where many rulers of the Savoy dynasty are interred.       
         Kate Born Schaeffer, a longtime partner with her husband at Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan, which became known for selling art by old masters to museums and collectors, died on Dec. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 102.         For three decades Mrs. Schaeffer and her husband, Dr. Hanns Schaeffer, ran the New York Schaeffer Galleries, which was founded in 1936 and has been at 983 Park Avenue in Manhattan for more than 50 years. They also contributed some artworks to museums.         Dr. Schaeffer died in the early 1960's and Mrs. Schaeffer became the owner and president of Schaeffer Galleries until her death. Schaeffer Galleries is now owned and directed by the Schaeffers' daughter, Cornelia Bessie, who had been its vice president.         James J. Rorimer, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1955 to 1967, observed in 1961: ''The Schaeffers are among the most serious, knowledgeable and helpful art dealers who are enabling American museums to grow for the benefit of our public. They are friends who share unstintingly in helping curators, directors and trustees to choose with care the works of art which redound to the credit of their museums.''         The paintings and drawings that passed through the Schaeffers' hands included, among many others, Botticelli's ''Madonna and Child with Singing Angels,'' now held by the Staatliche Museen in Berlin; a Cranach in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo.; Correggio's ''Salvator Mundi'' in the National Gallery of Art in Washington; Rubens's ''Cleopatra'' at the Detroit Institute of Arts; a Frans Hals at the Mauritshuis in The Hague; numerous Rembrandts, including ''Young Man With a Sword'' in the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh; and da Vinci's ''Bear Walking'' and a Jean-Antoine Watteau, both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Gilbert S. Edelson, the administrative vice president of the Art Dealers Association of America, which is based in Manhattan, said the Schaeffers ''were knowledgeable, they were articulate, they had all the qualities that make truly distinguished dealers.''         Mrs. Schaeffer, whose maiden name was Born, was born in Germany and studied singing in various European capitals. She was a lieder and opera singer in Germany for a few years before she married Dr. Schaeffer, who was also born in Germany, not long after World War I ended. Later, gallery work became her main activity.         Her husband opened an art gallery in 1921 in Berlin and later operated galleries in London and San Francisco. Those galleries were also each named Schaeffer Galleries. All had closed before Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan was founded, after the Schaeffers had moved to the United States permanently.         Mrs. Schaeffer is survived by her daughter, Cornelia Bessie of Lyme, Conn.       
         Beatrice S. Burstein, who was one of the first women to serve as a justice of the State Supreme Court and who used her position to promote social activism, died on Saturday at her home in Lawrence, on Long Island. She was 85.         In a judicial career that spanned 30 years, Justice Burstein served on three different courts in Nassau County, outspokenly voicing her liberal opinions and acting as an advocate for the rights of children and prisoners at a time when the courts and county politics were dominated by conservatives.         Justice Burstein helped set up the first outpatient drug treatment center in Nassau County, visited detention centers unannounced to check on conditions, and pushed for the establishment of the first school at the Nassau jail.         As the wife of a prominent lawyer and the mother of six, including former Judge Karen S. Burstein, a former candidate for state attorney general, Justice Burstein belonged to what one federal judge called ''the first legal family of Nassau County.''         In addition to Karen Burstein, Justice Burstein is survived by her daughters Ellen, Patricia and Jessica, all of New York; two sons, John, of Camden, Me., and Judd, of Westport, Conn.; a sister, Helen Deutsch of Deerfield Beach, Fla.; and two grandsons.         Justice Burstein was born on May 18, 1915, in Brooklyn. Her parents, Joseph and Tillie Sobel, were immigrants from what is now Poland. She attended New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and New York University. While at college, she also took piano classes at the Juilliard School of Music on a scholarship. She earned her law degree from St. John's University and passed the New York State Bar exam in 1940.         While in law school, she met her future husband, Herbert Burstein. They married in 1937, and Justice Burstein became an associate at her husband's law firm when she finished law school. In 1958, she became a founding partner in the firm of Burstein & Agata, where she specialized in family law.         Justice Burstein was the first woman to be appointed to the New York State Commission of Correction, on which she served from 1955 to 1961. She also served on President John F. Kennedy's Commission on Juvenile Delinquency at the United Nations in 1961.         A Democrat, she was elected in 1962 with bipartisan support to District Court in Nassau County. Six years later, she was elected to Family Court. In 1972, she took a seat on the State Supreme Court in Nassau County, serving for the next 19 years, with the maximum of three post-retirement extensions.         Justice Burstein became a role model for judges seeking to extend their influence outside of the courtroom. She pushed to have psychiatric evaluations and probation reports completed more swiftly. She tried to visit every detention facility in her county, and in 1970, pushed for and succeeded in ending the solitary confinement of children.         She retired as a judge at the age of 76, but remained active in the legal system, serving as a judicial hearing officer for the state appellate division until last year.         ''She was really one of the first feminists to make a legal and judicial career in the metropolitan area,'' said Justice Jack B. Weinstein, a senior federal judge with the United States District Court in the Eastern District of New York. ''She retained a youthful interest and concern for society as it was evolving rather than as it was theoretically viewed by some court members.''       
         Dr. Alexandra Adler, a New York neurologist and psychiatrist who carried on the tradition of her father, Alfred Adler, one of the pioneers of psychoanalytic theory, died Jan. 4 at New York University Hospital. She was 99 and lived in Manhattan.         A native of Vienna, she was among the earliest women to practice as a neurologist there and then in the United States. Her work on brain damage and alexia, the loss of the ability to read because of brain lesions, was often cited by others in the field.         She also wrote papers on psychological subjects ranging from alcoholism to juvenile delinquency. She was among the first to write detailed papers on post-traumatic stress syndrome, reflecting her studies of the surviving victims of the Coconut Grove nightclub fire in Boston in 1942, one of the nation's worst fire disasters.         Besides killing more than 490 people, the blaze left others with permanent brain damage. Dr. Adler studied the anxiety and depression that can follow such catastrophes and later applied her findings to the treatment World War II veterans.         Dr. Adler interpreted Adlerian theories in a book first published in 1938, ''Guiding Human Misfits: A Practical Application of Individual Psychology.'' It went through several editions in the United States and was republished in Germany in 1990.         Dr. Adler received her medical degree in Vienna, where she trained and practiced at the neuropsychiatric clinic of the University of Vienna. At the time, she also started editing the International Journal of Individual Psychology, the branch of psychology her father pioneered after he broke with Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytical emphasis on sex as the root of neurosis.         She came to this country in 1935 to teach and practice at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She joined the N.Y.U. faculty in 1946 and became a full professor of psychiatry at the its medical school in 1969.         An expert in schizophrenia, she worked at the New York City Department of Correction for 20 years with female offenders and was medical director of the Alfred Adler Mental Hygiene Clinic in Manhattan. She continued to see some patients at her private practice until a few years ago.         She contributed entries to national and international reference works.         In 1959, Dr. Adler married Dr. Halfdan Gregersen, a former dean and professor of Romance languages at Williams College. He died in 1980, and there are no immediate survivors.       
         G. E. M. Anscombe, a British moral and analytic philosopher as well as one of Wittgenstein's literary executors, died on Jan. 5 in Cambridge, England. She was 81 and had chronic heart disease, said her husband, Peter Geach.         Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe -- known by her initials or as Elizabeth -- was a dry, fresh and formidable thinker, one of the foremost philosophers of mind, language, ethics and action. She fused Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and Aristotle's philosophy of ethics, framing an original theory of action.         Her work was tightly linked with Wittgenstein's. She was Wittgenstein's student and friend during World War II.         In 1951, when Wittgenstein died, Miss Anscombe, along with Wittgenstein's two other executors, Rush Rhees and G.H. von Wright, began the task of getting his work into print. (''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,'' which came out in 1921, was Wittgenstein's only book published in his lifetime.)         Miss Anscombe translated Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations'' from German into English, and had it published in 1953. Her translation of his work called ''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics'' came out in 1956. With Mr. von Wright, she assembled little bits of Wittgenstein's writings that had been cut up and stuffed in a box, and published them under the title ''Zettel'' (''Snippets'') in 1967.         Miss Anscombe and Mr. von Wright also put together ''Notebooks, 1914-1916.'' Editions of Wittgenstein's ''On Certainty,'' ''Remarks on Colour'' and ''Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology'' followed.         In 1959, Miss Anscombe wrote ''An Introduction to Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus,'' which traced his work to Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. The book is viewed as a classic by philosophers.         A. J. Ayer, in his book ''Wittgenstein,'' wrote, ''I can think of no one but Elizabeth Anscombe who has made an original contribution to philosophy on the basis of Wittgenstein's teaching.'' In 1980, Miss Anscombe even inherited Wittgenstein's former position, the chair of philosophy at Cambridge University.         Wittgenstein was not her sole influence. She also wrote about Plato. And in the field of ethics, Miss Anscombe looked especially to Aristotle. Like Aristotle, she believed that ethics must be tied to the idea of what it means to flourish as a human being. Mr. Geach, her husband and sometime collaborator, a professor of philosophy at the University of Birmingham and University of Leeds, put it this way: ''She thought that a theory of ethics without a theory of mind was bound to be bogus.''         In 1957 she wrote ''Intention,'' a blend of Aristotle's and Wittgenstein's philosophy, linking ethical ideas and behavior to a theory of intention and action. The philosopher Donald Davidson recently called the work ''the most important treatment of action since Aristotle.'' Her husband said that may have been an overstatement.         The next year she wrote an influential essay on morality, ''Modern Moral Philosophy,'' which was later published in her three-volume ''Collected Philosophical Papers'' (1981). In that essay, as Cora Diamond, a professor at the University of Virginia, explained, Miss Anscombe argued that the concepts of moral obligation and moral beauty were legalistic and should be abandoned. Right and wrong actions, Miss Anscombe said, cannot be determined by their consequences but rather are absolutes. She recommended Aristotle's concept of virtue instead.         In 1940, Miss Anscombe converted to Catholicism, and many of her writings reflected her moral and religious stance. In a 1939 pamphlet, ''The Justice of the Present War Examined,'' she had argued that Britain was entering an unjust war.         In ''Mr. Truman's Degree,'' she fought Oxford's decision to give an honorary degree to Harry S. Truman, accusing him of murdering innocents in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.         She condemned contraception in a pamphlet called ''Contraception and Chastity'' (1975), saying ''you might as well accept any sexual goings-on, if you accept contraceptive intercourse.''         In 1957, in an anti-Cartesian paper called ''The First Person,'' she said that ''I'' does not refer to anything.  And in 1985 she resurrected St. Anselm's 900-year-old argument for the existence of God.         G. E. M. Anscombe was born March 18, 1919, the daughter of Allen Wells Anscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Thomas Anscombe. One of her two brothers was killed in the war. His twin, Thomas, survives Miss Anscombe. She was educated at Sydenham School and St. Hugh's College, Oxford.         At Newnham College, Cambridge, she was a research student from 1941 to 1944. That was where she first met Wittgenstein. She taught at Somerville College, Oxford, from 1946 to 1970. From 1970 to 1986, she was a professor of philosophy at Cambridge. She became a fellow of the British Academy in 1967 and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Miss Anscombe and her husband were a well-known philosophical duo. They met while studying Catholic doctrine at Blackfriars College, Oxford. They were married in 1941 and had seven children, all of whom survive her: three sons (John, Charles and More) and four daughters (Barbara, Mary, Jennifer and Tamsin). Miss Anscombe and Mr. Geach also produced a book together, ''Three Philosophers''; he wrote on Aquinas and Frege, she on Aristotle.         Miss Anscombe, who did not like to be called Mrs. Geach, smoked cigars, wore trousers when they were considered improper for women and was said sometimes to eat beans from a tin can while lecturing.         Her philosophy was bold and noncomplacent too. In the Times Literary Supplement, the critic Mary Tiles wrote, ''Anscombe's willingness to question what many have taken for granted . . . can induce a feeling of intellectual disorientation.''       
         Betty Kenward, who exhaustively and uncritically chronicled the lives of England's upper classes at their dinners, balls, race meetings and country weekends in the pages of London's toniest magazines, died last Wednesday in London. She was 94.         A snob and proud of it, Mrs. Kenward composed numbingly undramatic accounts of parties, with long lists of names preceded by unfailingly complimentary adjectives and with their relative importance encoded for her privileged readership by idiosyncratic punctuation. Ordinary guests' names were set off from one another by mere commas. But Royal Family members and others of note rated semicolons. Many of the breathless serial sentences ended with exclamation marks.         In a career that ended in 1991, she reported on the doings of society at a time when cigarettes and wine glasses were airbrushed out of photographs, and there was never a mention of someone arriving with a surprise consort. People from business and publishing and advertising and popular culture may have been starting to mix in society late in her career, but they never made it into ''Jennifer's Diary,'' where the exclusivity of prewar family background was remorselessly maintained.         Attentive readers of the long-running column learned to divine judgments in the bland copy. A remark on the ''tirelessness'' of a hostess rather than her ''radiance'' meant that the night was probably a disaster. If a debutante was ''pretty'' instead of ''exquisite,'' then she was very likely ugly or badly turned out. The only way Mrs. Kenward registered utter disapproval was by omission.         She was wary of people who paraded by too often in search of a mention, and she made sure they did not receive one. When a young society photographer, Antony Armstrong-Jones, approached at a function, she said, ''My photographers never speak to me at parties.'' A year later, he married Princess Margaret and became Lord Snowdon, but Mrs. Kenward was still unforgiving. Diary items about the royal couple identified them simply as ''HRH Princess Margaret and her husband.''         Mrs. Kenward became a fixture in London society as much as for her decorous look as for what she wrote in ''Jennifer's Diary.'' She favored pink taffeta ball dresses and always wore a geishalike facial mask of powder with deep mascara, heavily penciled eyebrows and a four-strand pearl choker. Her lacquered champagne-blond bouffant hairdo was held in place by a color-coordinated velvet bow across the back. She strode through life with a purposeful posture, and her sweeping ballroom entrances were often met by swarms of tuxedoed men greeting her.         She never claimed to be a journalist, partly out of a desire not to seem pretentious and partly out of her conviction that most journalists were vulgar. She called gossip columnists ''gutter rats.'' Mrs. Kenward carried no pad and took no notes, but earned the grudging respect of newsroom professionals with her ability to remember perfectly what she had seen and by her insistence on accuracy.         If she drove proofreaders to distraction, she was hardest of all on her assistants, young women of good breeding whom she called secretaries. She forbade them to smoke, insisted that they use fountain pens instead of ballpoints and hectored them for having dirty hair or being overweight or receiving too many personal calls.         '' 'You look a perfect fright,' she'd snap, and they'd weep in the loos all lunchtime,'' Vicki Woods, her last editor at Harpers & Queen, told The Sunday Telegraph. None lasted more than four months. When one dared to cover an event herself, a replacement was sought with an advertisement that required ''no, repeat no, ambitions to write.''         Her routine was to have her chauffeur drive her from her Mayfair apartment to the Harpers & Queen office, where she met briefly with two assistants in her curtained-off work space piled high with invitations and calling cards and then go to lunch at Claridge's. She returned in the afternoon to file her copy from the previous night, evenings that typically included a reception, two cocktail parties and a formal dinner.         She was born Elizabeth Kemp-Welch on July 14, 1906, the daughter of Brian and Verena Kemp-Welch, a couple who spent much of their marriage living apart and conducting indiscreet romances. The situation led to an early experience of being a social outcast that might have influenced the daughter's subsequent attention to class preferences and enforced ignorance of extramarital affairs. Mrs. Kenward later said of her mother, ''She was very pretty but very immoral.''         Mrs. Kenward married Capt. Peter Kenward, a cavalry officer who worked in his family brewery business, in 1932 and was divorced from him 10 years later. She raised their son Jim, paying for his secondary school education at Winchester by pawning jewelry and working in a munitions factory, as a house matron at Eton and on the inquiries desk at British Vogue. Jim Kenward became an accountant and moved to Canada.         In World War II, she began writing a column for Tatler, ''On and Off Duty in Town and Country.'' With peace, the column was retitled ''Jennifer's Diary,'' because an editor said her refined looks suited the name Jennifer. Mrs. Kenward stayed there until 1959, when she switched to Queen and, in 1970, to its successor, Harpers & Queen.         When she closed out her career, she had never taken a sick day. The Independent reported that, describing her life in 1995, she said, ''In spite of having a cataract in both eyes, a hearing aid in both ears, a leaking heart valve and coronary arteries, which means taking 19 pills a day, I'm still having a go.''       
         Eleanor Lawrence, a flutist who played frequently in chamber music performances and with several orchestras in New York and who is credited with transforming a newsletter into an important resource for flutists, died on Jan. 16 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was brain cancer, said Nancy Toff, a flute historian and a former president of the National Flute Association.         Ms. Lawrence, who was also known by her married name, Eleanor Steindler, was born in Boston and grew up in Athens, Ohio, where her father, John C. Baker, was president of Ohio University. After completing her bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College, she studied the flute at the New England Conservatory with James Pappoutsakis, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She later studied with the flutist Marcel Moyse as well as with William Kincaid, the principal flutist of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and Harold Bennett, the principal flutist of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra.         When Ms. Lawrence moved to New York in the 1960's, she joined the American Symphony Orchestra and the Brooklyn Philharmonic and performed periodically with the New York Philharmonic and at the Metropolitan Opera. She also toured the United States as a recitalist. In 1969 she founded the Monomoy Chamber Ensemble, which played an annual summer series at the Monomoy Theater in Chatham, Mass. In recent years the ensemble performed as Monomoy Music and presented an annual series at Weill Recital Hall.         Ms. Lawrence had a broad repertory that included Ernst von Dohnanyi's Aria for Flute and Piano and Passacaglia for Solo Flute, both composed for her, and works by Hindemith, which she recorded for the Musical Heritage Society. One of her last projects was a reissue of Moyse's recordings, produced with the flutist William Bennett.         In addition to performing, Ms. Lawrence was an influential teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, and in master classes.         She was the president of the New York Flute Club for three nonconsecutive terms from 1973 to 1989. She edited The National Flute Association Newsletter, now The Flutist Quarterly, from the mid-1970's to the early 80's and expanded it from a concise information sheet to a publication that regularly included interviews with important flutists.         She is survived by her husband, Frank Steindler; a daughter, Catherine Steindler; a son, Frederick Steindler; and two sisters, Elizabeth Baker and Anne Baker, all of New York.       
         Kitty Buck, who with her husband, Otto, ran Cake Masters Bakery, an institution on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that made cakes for Liberace, President Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor -- and for less famous families' celebrations -- for more than half a century, died on Jan. 9 in Oceanside, N.Y.         She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         Cake Masters, which the Bucks founded and operated, was known by its slogan, ''where baking is an art.'' At its peak, there were 15 shops, 14 in Manhattan and one in Queens. Many of the stores were clustered within blocks of each other on Broadway, a reflection of a time before supermarkets when people walked to bakeries for their daily loaves.         The chain developed the concept of cake as extravaganza, and sold many creations to theatrical and film productions. When Michael Todd staged a Madison Square Garden celebration in 1957 for the first anniversary of his movie ''Around the World in 80 Days,'' Cake Masters delivered the cake, even as an elephant delivered Mr. Todd's wife, Miss Taylor.         Mrs. Buck was born Gussie Rubin on June 15, 1907, in Hurleyville, N.Y., in the Catskills and attended a one-room school, where the teacher demanded, ''What kind of name is Gussie?'' According to her grandson Michael Halio, the teacher then said, ''I'm going to call you Katherine.''         She immediately shortened her new name to Kitty, and in the 1930's, had it legally changed.         She grew up on a dairy farm near Bridgeville, also in the Catskills, her daughter Barbara Halio said. Her father opened a rooming house for summer tourists, which later became the Capitol Hotel. When the hotel burned down in the late 1920's, the family moved to the Bronx and settled down on Morris Avenue.         She got a job as a sales clerk in a Bronx bakery, where a co-worker introduced her to Otto, a young baker who had recently immigrated from Germany. They married in 1930. In 1937, they borrowed $500 from Kitty's sister, Muriel, for a down payment on the first Cake Masters, at Broadway and 84th Street. Eventually baking operations were centralized at the company's building on West 72nd Street, which opened in 1955, and the other locations were used as stores.         In 1959, Mr. Buck died at 52. Mrs. Buck resolved to carry on. ''This is my husband's sweat and blood,'' she said, according to family lore.         A woman running what was then often a man's business, Mrs. Buck pushed racks around the bakery floor, rode to the stores in the cabs of her trucks and dealt with unions daily. In a photograph of a food industry gathering at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1965, she was the only woman on the dais.         By herself, she more than kept up the bakery's style. In 1961, it was a Cake Masters technician who was sent to Washington to confect a huge cake for President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball. In 1982, a Cake Masters cake towered over the first ''Night of 100 Stars'' at Radio City Music Hall. Often, one of its creations was part of the bridal display at Tiffany & Company.         Mrs. Buck was also admired for her personal style, with some likening her upswept hair, smoky voice and quick wit to those of Lauren Bacall, who bought her children's birthday cakes at Cake Masters.         The stores began to close as rents rose and customers began to bypass butchers and bakers for supermarkets. The last Cake Masters shop, on Third Avenue at 65th Street, closed in 1992. Mrs. Buck, then 85, retired.         In addition to her daughter Barbara, of Oceanside, and her sister, Muriel Merritt, of San Antonio, Mrs. Buck is survived by another daughter, Joan Buck of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         A'Lelia Nelson, a librarian who was a former president of a famous early black enterprise, the Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, died Jan. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 82. The cause was pancreatic cancer.         Ms. Nelson was linked to the company's founder, Madame C. J. Walker, who was her father's boss. Walker became a legend in the early 20th century by rising from poverty to become a millionaire, the first black American woman to do so. Her hair-straightening method and line of beauty products were sold by thousands of sales agents.         After Walker died in 1919, her daughter A'Lelia Walker took over the company. Her life was extravagant, and she ran a salon in Harlem called the Dark Tower that attracted celebrities like Langston Hughes.         A'Lelia Nelson's father, Freeman B. Ransom, was the company's general manager and lawyer during the years A'Lelia Walker was president, and named his daughter for her when she was born on Aug. 14, 1918. Her mother, Nettie Cox Ransom, was a teacher.         Miss Ransom entered Talladega College in Alabama at 16. After graduation, she got a master's degree in library science from Columbia University, where she was the only black person in her year of the program, said one daughter, the writer Jill Nelson.         She worked for a year in Waco, Tex., as a school librarian. In 1942, she became acquisitions supervisor for the Library of Congress in Washington, where she met Stanley Earl Nelson, then a student at Howard University's dentistry school.         They married in 1948 and moved to New York City. Ms. Nelson became vice president of Walker Manufacturing. In 1953, she became president. Walker's will decreed that the president must always be a woman. But the company was by then in decline. It was sold in the 1980's.         In 1968, Ms. Nelson worked on the ''Harlem on My Mind'' exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         From 1969 to 1996, she was a librarian at the City College of New York, where she compiled ''Black Spectrum: Bibliography of Black Studies Holdings in Cohen Library.'' She also organized a writers' festival named for Langston Hughes.         She was divorced in the 1970's. She is survived by two daughters, Jill and Lynn Nelson of New York; two sons, Stanley Earl Nelson Jr. of New York and Ralph Lewis Nelson of Berkeley, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Phyllis S. Levy, a prominent Good Housekeeping book editor who in her early publishing career helped discover Ken Kesey, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was ovarian cancer, friends said.         A New York native, Ms. Levy graduated from Radcliffe, where she was a roommate of Rona Jaffe. Ms. Jaffe later wrote the best seller ''The Best of Everything,'' about young women in publishing, and included a character inspired by Ms. Levy.         Ms. Levy began her career in the 1950's with Simon & Schuster and later moved to Viking Press, where she championed Mr. Kesey's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''         Later she become a senior editor at McCall's, moving to Good Housekeeping in 1992.         She is survived by her mother, Ruth Jaffe, who married Rona Jaffe's father, and a sister, Susan Chapin of Washington.       
         Sonia Arova, a Bulgarian-born ballerina who became an international star and was an early partner of such great male dancers as Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev, died on Sunday in San Diego. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Ms. Arova was the ballerina with whom Nureyev danced the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux at his New York debut with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet on March 10, 1962, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She and Bruhn first met in the mid-1940's in the Metropolitan Ballet, a short-lived but artistically enterprising London troupe.         Nureyev, Bruhn, Ms. Arova and the American ballerina Rosella Hightower joined forces to present sensationally successful programs together in Paris in 1962. Later that year, she was again Nureyev's ballerina as guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.         A dancer of strong technique and dramatic projection, Ms. Arova was born Sonia Errio in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where she studied music as well as ballet, receiving her dance training at the school of the Sofia Opera Ballet. When her teachers recommended further study in Paris, she left Bulgaria at age 11 with her mother. Her father sold his stamp collection to pay for her Parisian classes.         With the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Arova's British piano teacher in Paris urged her to escape France. Disguised in male attire as the teacher's son, Ms. Arova was smuggled into England on a fishing boat in 1940. She never saw her father again but was eventually reunited with her mother and sister.         In England, she danced with International Ballet (1942), Ballet Rambert (1946) and, most notably, with Metropolitan Ballet (1947-48). Then she became a balletic globe-trotter.         Ms. Arova was first associated with Page in Paris in 1951 when she danced a leading role in ''Revenge,'' the popular choreographic adaptation of the opera ''Il Trovatore'' that Page created for Les Ballets des Champs Élysées. Later, she appeared with Page's own Chicago company.         She was guest artist with American Ballet Theater several times in the 1950's and 60's, dancing both classical and contemporary works. Reviewing her performance in 1956, John Martin of The New York Times said she had become ''a lovely and curiously individual dancer, especially where dramatic color and characterization are involved.''         She also danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, London Festival Ballet, the Komaki Ballet of Japan, the Australian Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington.         Ms. Arova became increasingly involved with company direction, often in association with Thor Sutowski, the American dancer and choreographer, whom she married in 1965. As director of the Norwegian National Ballet from 1966 to 1970, she introduced several ballets by George Balanchine into the repertory, produced the first complete Oslo versions of ''Swan Lake'' and ''La Sylphide'' and was knighted for her services by King Olaf V.         She became director of the San Diego Ballet in 1971. In 1977 she and Mr. Sutowski were named co-directors of the dance department at the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a state-run high school in Birmingham. Many dancers they trained joined the Birmingham-based Ballet South, which made its New York debut at Brooklyn College in 1996 with a ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski. Anna Kisselgoff of The Times praised it for allowing its young women to ''show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork'' and ''dance with a pure classical style.''         Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski returned to San Diego in 1997, where they taught for both the San Diego Ballet and the California Ballet.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ariane Sutowski of San Diego, and a sister, Jeanette Errio of Vence, France.       
         Rosalie Gwathmey, a photographer who was noted for the warmth and artful simplicity of her pictures of black Southern communities, and who threw away all her negatives in 1955 after donating most of her prints to the New York Public Library, died on Monday at her home in Amagansett, N.Y., said her son, the architect Charles Gwathmey. She was 92.         A textile designer throughout the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Gwathmey seldom looked back on her photographic past, which was in turn largely forgotten by the photographic world. That changed in 1994. A solo exhibition of her images from the 40's, at Glenn Horowitz Bookseller in East Hampton, N.Y., suddenly revived interest in her work.         Like the photographer Doris Ulmann, who found grace and simple beauty in a South Carolina black community in the 20's and early 30's, Mrs. Gwathmey focused on black life in her hometown, Charlotte, N.C., and in Rocky Mount, N.C. Unlike Ulmann, whose pictures of mostly poor blacks have a gentle, dignified grandeur, Mrs. Gwathmey's more sharply focused images are grittier, reflecting a quirkier mind and eye.         In the foreground of a picture from the 40's a woman sits calmly in a chair on the porch of her modest house, a crowded clothesline stretching from a nearby post. Behind her, though, bulldozers are busily clearing the ground for a highway.         In another photograph a barefoot sharecropper stands at a doorway, his steady gaze on the photographer, his checked shirt and patched trousers somehow all of a piece with the bold wood planks on an exterior wall festooned with garlands of peppers.         In 1946 Mrs. Gwathmey's work was in a New Photographers group show at the Museum of Modern Art. Edward Steichen included one of her images in the Family of Man exhibition in 1955, the year that Mrs. Gwathmey's photographic career abruptly ended.         Since the early 40's she had been involved with the Photo League in Manhattan, whose members included Paul Strand, Berenice Abbott, Dorothea Lange and W. Eugene Smith. But when the league was attacked as subversive during the McCarthy era, its membership evaporated and the league disbanded in 1951. Tired of keeping her work in the closet, Mrs. Gwathmey simply walked away from photography, she said in an interview for the Glenn Horowitz exhibition catalog.         Rosalie Hook was born on Sept. 15, 1908, in Charlotte. Intending to be a portrait painter, she studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where she met Robert Gwathmey, who would become known for his social realist paintings. They married in 1935.         After their son, Charles, was born in 1938 and they were living in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Gwathmey took up photography. ''I was crazy about the way the city looked,'' she said. She studied there with the photographer Luke Swank.         At the Photo League she studied with Paul Strand. ''Paul was a perfectionist,'' she recalled in the same catalog interview. ''He taught his students to save only their perfect prints, to mat them beautifully and to frame them beautifully.'' Her reaction was, ''I began to feel it was too precious.''         A few years before her 1994 exhibition, she recalled, she had written to the New York Public Library, saying that she would like to have some of her pictures back. ''I had a chance to sell some and I could use the money.'' The library gave her 15 duplicates. She signed them and gave them to the buyer. Several transactions later, the pictures ended up in the possession of Mr. Horowitz.         Mrs. Gwathmey, whose husband died in 1988, is survived by her son and two grandchildren.         She said she saw her photography as a ''documentary thing,'' and not as an art form. In fact, the humanism in her work went with an artist's eye for composition and form. ''We all know,'' she said, ''that if the language isn't eloquent, no one bothers to finish the story.''       
         Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107.         Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare.         The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers' safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory.         The union's successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago.         Mrs. Freedman's life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband's death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79.         Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. ''I'd look matronly,'' she said.         Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused.         The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same.         The alternative was jumping.         ''Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,'' she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, ''The Living Century,'' shown in December and January.         As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. ''When I came in the street, here comes my father,'' she recalled. ''He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn't go back to work anymore. I went to college.''         The anger about what she saw as the owners' greed persisted. In the documentary, she said:         ''That's the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It's not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything.         ''That's the biggest mistake -- that a person doesn't count much when he hasn't got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn't got a heart? I don't pretend. I feel it. Still.''         Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania.         With Mrs. Freedman's father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman's housecleaning abilities. ''You call this work?'' she demanded.         Mrs. Freedman's response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good -- she eventually spoke seven languages -- she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire.         She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where.         When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman's grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search.         After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York.         They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, ''Five years.'' She replied, ''I have time.''         Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64.         ''Of course it was a lie, but they didn't know it was a lie,'' she said. She worked until she was 79.         In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100.         She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself.         Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107.         ''To me, 106 is a number,'' she said in the documentary. ''I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You've got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?''         Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter's birth, and always advised the child's mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died.         ''Sadness takes years from you,'' she said.         Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying.         ''This is the last voice of an event,'' he said. ''This woman actually smelled the smoke.''       
         Gail Fisher, who won an Emmy Award in 1970 for her portrayal of Peggy Fair, secretary to the gumshoe played by Mike Connors on the CBS television series ''Mannix,'' died on Dec. 2 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 65.         The cause was kidney failure.         Ms. Fisher's role on ''Mannix'' was the high point of a career that arched from rural poverty in New Jersey to a home in Beverly Hills before descending into problems with drugs and sporadic acting jobs.         At the peak of her career, on ''Mannix,'' whose residuals helped support her later, Ms. Fisher was fiercely proud of her achievement.         ''Well, certain people who had no knowledge of blacks have maybe -- maybe -- learned something because of 'Mannix's' Peggy Fair,'' she said in a 1972 interview. ''Blacks were pretty much alien objects on TV as recently as 10 years ago, you know, and now we're people. I think maybe before it's all over, it's going to be all right, and I'm proud I'm a part of that.''         The series, one of the most violent and longest-running of its era, began  in September 1967 and continued until August 1975. After the first year, to counteract unimpressive ratings, ''Mannix'' was changed, and Peggy Fair, the widow of a police officer who had been a friend of Joe Mannix, was added to the cast.         ''It was really a revolution in casting, you know,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''It was understood by all of us who auditioned that the girl could be anything -- oriental, black, anything -- just a human being. I won.''         Ms. Fisher was also proud of another achievement. ''I was the first black female -- no, make that black, period -- to make a national TV commercial, on camera, with lines,'' she said, referring to a pitch for the detergent All in the early 1960's.         Her achievements bucked discouragement.         ''My friends and family thought I was crazy,'' she said. ''You know, 'But honey, there ain't any black actresses.' ''         But she was determined to be one. She was born in Orange, N.J., and grew up in Potters Crossing, a black section of Edison Township, N.J.         She was one of five children. Ms. Fisher described her mother, Ona, as ''a great lady who brought me up to know there's no such thing as 'I can't.' ''         Ms. Fisher was 2 when her father died. As a teenager she was a cheerleader and a beauty contest winner. She was Miss Transit and Miss Black New Jersey and Miss Press Photographer. She modeled occasionally,  worked in a factory and skipped meals to pay for acting lessons. She studied with Lee Strasberg and  joined what was then the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center, working with Elia Kazan and Herbert Blau. Mr. Blau cast her as a young firebrand in a 1965 production of ''Danton's Death.''         She took time out for marriage and motherhood and moved to the West Coast, where she had random jobs on minor shows until she auditioned for ''Mannix.''         She was married several times, most notably in 1964 to her personal manager, Joe Levy. The marriage produced two daughters before ending in divorce.         Ms. Fisher is survived by her daughters, Samara Maxe of San Diego and Jole Baerga of Hackensack, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Fisher of Randallstown, Md.; and a sister, Ona Gaither of Alexandria, Va.       
         Sylvia Lawry, whose brother's incurable multiple sclerosis prompted her to found national and international organizations to fight the disease, died on Saturday at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Roosevelt Island. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lawry founded both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the United States, in 1946, and the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, in 1967. She was also one of the leaders of the effort to establish the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, in 1950.         It all began with a classified advertisement in 1945 in which Ms. Lawry beseeched readers to write her of any cures for multiple sclerosis. Instead, she got more than 50 replies asking for the same thing. Her life's mission was the result.         Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. Its onslaught is signaled by sudden neurological symptoms, including loss of vision, paralysis, numbness and difficulties in walking, as nerves lose their sheathing and are unable to conduct signals.         Partly as a result of research financed by the societies started by Ms. Lawry, scientists now suspect that the disease may be caused by a viral infection on top of an inherited genetic susceptibility, though the specific triggering mechanism remains unknown.         The national society has also helped develop medicines to alleviate symptoms and prolong life expectancy, essentially offering a normal life span to many with multiple sclerosis. In 1890, when multiple sclerosis was treated with herbs and bed rest, life expectancy was five years.  But there is still no cure for the disease, which the society says strikes another adult each hour, leaving the most afflicted paralyzed.         ''Sylvia's uncompromising battle for more than a half century to solve the mystery of multiple sclerosis made her a hero to anyone touched by this devastating disease,'' said Richard Slifka, chairman of the society.         The national society credited her with the first use of the abbreviation M.S. for the disease. The Oxford English Dictionary cites as the first use of the term a 1955 article in Science News Letter discussing work by the society.         Sylvia Friedman was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1915. Her father manufactured Venetian blinds. She graduated from Hunter College in 1936 and went to work in the office of her father's attorney as a receptionist. She hoped to go to law school and took a job in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.         In 1944, she married Michael Lawry; they were divorced two years later. She used the last name Lawry for the rest of her life, though she married Stanley Englander, who was in the wholesale meat business, in 1957. He died in 1968.         When Ms. Lawry's brother, Bernard, was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1945, she and her sister Alice placed a classified advertisement in The New York Times: ''Multiple sclerosis. Will anyone recovered from it please communicate with patient. T272 Times.''         The sisters received 54 replies from people as desperate as they were. Most asked to be informed if the two heard anything promising.         ''I was looking for medical clues that might have helped my brother,'' Ms. Lawry said in an interview with The New York Post in 1959. ''But when the responses started to snowball and come from all over the country, I decided to give up the law and let my creative energies spill over into helping M.S. victims.''         Starting with family and friends, Ms. Lawry built a network. Her sister Alice helped. Her other sister, Lillian, and her husband, Stanley Wilson, founded one of the first local chapters, in the Bronx.         Ms. Lawry is survived by Lillian Wilson, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Englander of Manhattan, and Steven Englander of Montgomery, N.Y., and two grandchildren.         The fight against multiple sclerosis grew. A tiny office was found. The doctors whom Ms. Lawry first consulted about her brother became interested in the effort.         Dee Sammak, the accounts payable manager who has worked for the society since 1954, said she has stayed all these years because of the inspiration of Ms. Lawry. ''Don't forget,'' Ms. Sammak said, ''when she started the society, women were not doing these things -- to start a society in a man's world.''         On March 11, 1946, Ms. Lawry assembled 20 prominent research scientists to found the Association for Advancement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which was renamed the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1947. Its first research grant went toward studying the relationship between the body's immune system and the effects of multiple sclerosis on the central nervous system.         Though her brother's health progressively weakened until his death in 1973, the organization Ms. Lawry founded gathered momentum. In 1950, she teamed up with Senator Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, whose daughter had multiple sclerosis, to lobby Congress for what is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.         The law creating the institute passed on Aug. 15, 1950. At that time, total federal appropriations for research on multiple sclerosis were $14,000. They now total $100 million a year, the society said.         Ms. Lawry's political skills were evident throughout her career. A frequent tactic, she told CNN in 1995, was to lobby people who had relatives or acquaintances with the disease. She mentioned winning support from President John F. Kennedy, who had a cousin with the disease, and Grace Kelly, whose first fiancé had it.         The international organization was born after the national society realized it was giving almost one-third of its research grants to foreigners. There are now 38 societies around the world.         Ms. Lawry, who worked 12-hour days, said she would never retire until multiple sclerosis retired. The disease still affects 1 in 1,000 people in the United States.         ''There was a continuing pain in her heart, because what she really wanted to see was M.S. go the way of polio,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a society spokeswoman.       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Dale Evans, who won the hearts of millions of Americans as she rode alongside her husband, Roy Rogers, in western films and on ''The Roy Rogers Show'' in the early years of television, died yesterday at her home in Apple Valley, Calif., east of Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Evans had not been on a horse since childhood and her hopes for a Hollywood career were sputtering when she was cast opposite John Wayne in her first Western, ''In Old Oklahoma,'' in 1944. She went on to become an accomplished sound-stage equestrienne, playing opposite rugged, handsome and likable cowboys in dozens of Westerns before she met and married Rogers, the King of the Cowboys, and composed the couple's enduring theme song, ''Happy Trails to You.''         By the 1950's she was a fixture on the sagebrush-epic landscape of snarling men, delicate ladies and roaring oil gushers. And with the dawn of television, she became a fixture in the minds of millions of children who tuned in to ''The Roy Rogers Show'' and saw her moseying  along on her buckskin horse, Buttermilk, while Rogers rode his beloved golden palomino, Trigger, the Smartest Horse in the Movies.         Miss Evans's break had come years earlier, while she was working as a $12-a-week stenographer in Dallas. While she was transcribing a letter, her boss suggested that she appear on a radio program that the company was sponsoring . She did, and soon was singing on regional radio hookups. By 1940 she was the featured performer on a CBS radio network program, ''News and Rhythm,'' and was heard on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy program.         She was also appearing at the Gay Paree supper club in Chicago, where her showstopper was ''Will You Marry Me, Mr. Larramie?''         One night an agent offered not marriage but a screen test, opposite Bing Crosby in ''Holiday Inn.'' She did not get the part in the film, which also starred Fred Astaire and featured such Irving Berlin hits as ''White Christmas.'' But 20th Century-Fox signed her to a one-year contract.         She moved to Republic in 1943 and was cast opposite Wayne in ''In Old Oklahoma'' (it was later retitled ''The War of the Wildcats''), a romance about a swaggering, no-nonsense oil driller. The following year, she was cast in ''The Cowboy and the Señorita.''         The cowboy was Roy Rogers, a rugged, handsome and likable man but, by his own account, ''no great shakes'' as a talker.         Miss Evans was no señorita -- at the time, she was married to her second husband, Robert Dale Butts, a pianist. They divorced in 1945, and the following year, Rogers's wife died after giving birth to a son, Roy Rogers Jr.         Miss Evans and Rogers made eight films together in 1946, including ''My Pal Trigger.'' She admitted to having trouble with Trigger: she made the mistake of patting his neck.         ''He is a very highly cued horse,'' she said. ''He is cued to rear when you touch that spot on his neck. He stood straight up on his hind legs. I slipped off that dish I was sitting on, and fell flat on my -- I fell off in the dust.''         Her fans complained that Rogers seemed to care more about Trigger than he cared about her. ''How that spurious cowhand can be content to kiss a horse when he has Miss Evans on the lot every day I cannot imagine,'' Robert C. Ruark wrote in The World-Telegram in 1946, ''but the inflexible law of westerns is that the hero shall never smooch the heroine.''         Once, she said, he came close.  ''They were going to let Roy kiss me on the forehead'' in one film -- she said she could not remember which. The idea was to show that he was sorry for pushing her under a bed to keep her from getting hurt in a rough-and-tumble scene. ''But they had a conference and decided against it,'' she said. ''The kids, you know, so I never even got kissed on the forehead. I just get knocked under beds.''         Miss Evans wore outfits of fringes, satins and studs that were every bit as sartorially splendid as those sported by her husband. Thousands and thousands of red-blooded American girls wore Dale Evans outfits and cast-iron six shooters in their matching holster sets as a kind of proto-feminist reach for equality with their brothers.         Dale Evans -- born Frances Octavia Smith on Oct. 31, 1912, in Uvalde, Tex. -- once said that her favorite role was Toni Ames, a newspaperwoman in ''Don't Fence Me In,'' which was released in 1945. ''I like to be active in a role, and hate namby-pamby heroines,'' she said. ''Toni was a pleasant departure from the usual western role, in which the girl just stands around while men do violent and admirable things.''         Miss Evans appeared in the 1950's with the evangelist Billy Graham, and in the 1960's she joined a group of other actors in pressing for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools.         She also began writing inspirational books like ''Angel Unaware'' (Revell, 1953) the story of her daughter Robin, who was born in 1950 with Down syndrome and heart problems and died a few days before her second birthday. ''Angel Unaware'' sold 400,000 copies in two years; Miss Evans gave the profits to the National Association for Retarded Children.         Contrary to common practice at the time, when such children were institutionalized, and contrary to Hollywood myth making, in which fans were not to know that perfect couples sometimes had imperfect children, Miss Evans and Rogers had kept Robin, who was their first child, at home with the family.         It was a large family from the start. Rogers had been a widower with three children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, a son, Roy  Jr., and another daughter, Linda Lou, and Miss Evans had a son, Thomas Frederick Fox Jr., from an earlier marriage that she had entered into when she was 14. To help them overcome their grief over the death of Robin, the couple adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee.         On Aug. 17, 1964, Deborah Lee, then 12 years old, was killed in a church bus-car collision near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David (Sandy) Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after one of their many goodwill visits to an orphanage, choked to death in a military hospital in Germany. An 18-year-old Army private, he had complained of feeling ill after dining at an enlisted men's club. After he died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ''Salute to Sandy.''         They also raised a foster child from Scotland, Marion Fleming, and a Choctaw Indian child, Mary Little Doe, called Dodie.         Roy Rogers died in 1998 at age 86.         Roy Rogers Jr. runs the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum in Victorville, Calif., at the edge of the Mojave Desert and seven miles from the Rogers-Evans ranch, named the Double-R Bar Ranch like the one in their television series.         There, amid all the memorabilia of a time in America when the good guys were polite singing cowboys who wore white hats and fought fairly and never cussed, is a glass case holding a stuffed Trigger, together with Miss Evans's horse Buttermilk and the couple's German shepherd, Bullet.         At the peak of their popularity in the late 1940's and early 50's, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had more than 2,000 fan clubs around the world and hundreds of licensed products from lunchboxes to comic books bore their names and faces.         Their rodeo set a box-office record at Madison Square Garden and they were the only couple to be chosen grand marshals of the annual Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif.         Miss Evans had almost as many credits for songwriting as she did for acting. She wrote or composed more than 25 songs, including ''Aha, San Antone,'' which sold more than 200,000 copies, and ''The Bible Tells Me So.'' She made 30 children's records, . including one that featured her own songs, ''Happy Birthday, Gentle Savior.''         ''I would love to be an evangelist,'' Miss Evans said, ''but I think God has revealed to me that I can serve him best by just remaining at my post.''         Correction:  February 10, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the film and television star Dale Evans on Thursday  misstated the name of the Chicago supper club where she performed in the early 1940's. It was Chez Paree, not Gay Paree.       
         Pauline Koner, one of the eclectic individualists of contemporary American dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         A choreographer noted for powerful solos, Miss Koner was also a principal dancer with the José Limón Dance Company, a leading modern-dance troupe of the 1940's and 50's. Stylistically versatile, she contributed to early television dance, taught dance around the world and choreographed stage shows at the Roxy Theater in New York and several ice revues. Although usually categorized as a modern dancer, she was fond of saying, ''I never had a modern-dance lesson in my life.''         She was born in New York in 1912,  the daughter of immigrants from Russia. Her father, Samuel Koner, a lawyer, had devised a medical plan for the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish socialist and benevolent organization; the result is considered a pioneering group medical plan.         Interested in the arts, Miss Koner wanted to study ballet with Michel Fokine, the most important balletic reformer of the early 20th century.  Her family considered his fees exorbitant, so her father offered his legal services free to Fokine in exchange for ballet lessons for young Pauline.         Miss Koner also studied Spanish dance and worked with Michio Ito and Yeichi Nimura, Japanese choreographers who blended Asian dance with Western modern dance.         Discussing her training in her autobiography, ''Solitary Song'' (Duke University Press, 1989), Miss Koner said she derived her speed and precision from ballet, her smoothness in covering space from Asian dance and her rhythm and dynamics from Spanish dance.         She presented her first solo concert on Dec. 7, 1930, and John Martin, then the dance critic for The New York Times, said that the event ''exhibited her unquestionable right to stand alone.'' He added, ''She can build a dance far better than the average, she can perform it with complete authority.''         Miss Koner toured Egypt and Palestine in 1932 and taught and performed in the Soviet Union from 1934 to 1936. Her solos then included  works on biblical themes, the ''Suite of Soviet Impressions,'' the satirical ''Three Funeral Marches'' and dances in Spanish and Arabian styles.         Miss Koner's career often took unexpected turns. In the early 40's she created dances for the Roxy and for ''Holiday on Ice.'' She began to choreograph for CBS television in 1945, experimenting with effects that only a camera could produce.         The most important change in her artistic development came that year  when, after a solo concert, she received a note from Doris Humphrey, the legendary American modern dance pioneer.         Humphrey praised the program, yet added criticism that Miss Koner found so perceptive that she sought out Humphrey and asked her to be her adviser, her ''outside eye,'' as she called her. Thereafter, Miss Koner would submit all her new choreography to Humphrey for comment. ''Our work together was a continuous revelation,'' she wrote in her autobiography, and added that after Humphrey's death in 1958: ''She inhabits me. She is my dybbuk.''         Martin declared in The Times in 1955 that, by working with Humphrey, Miss Koner ''has arrived at her true fulfillment'' and that the decision to ally herself with a mentor ''was an act of high artistic insight.'' Miss Koner honored Humphrey's memory in 1962 with ''The Farewell,'' an elegiac 30-minute solo that became her best-known piece of choreography.         Humphrey served as the artistic adviser to the Limón company and she and Limón asked Miss Koner to perform with the troupe. As a result, she became what she termed ''a permanent guest artist'' with the company from 1946 to 1960, creating roles in such major works as Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' (1949) and Humphrey's ''Ruins and Visions'' (1953).         At the same time, she choreographed for herself and other dancers with productions ranging in tone from ''Cassandra'' (1953), a warning against hysteria, to the gracious ''Concertino'' (1955). From 1976 to 1982 she headed the Pauline Koner Dance Consort.         Petite, with dark hair and eyes,  Miss Koner riveted audiences with her intensity. She designed many of her stage costumes and was always strikingly dressed offstage. Reviewing a Limón concert for Dance magazine in 1955, the critic Doris Hering wrote that ''Pauline Koner was like some fiery bacchante as she tore through leaps and sharp shifts in direction.''         Yet however spontaneous her dancing may have seemed, Miss Koner believed that the principles of stage presence and theatrical magnetism could be learned. She became famous for Elements of Performing, a course she taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts, the American Dance Festival and other schools in the United States, Europe and Asia. The course analyzed such facets of a performance as motivation, emotion, focus, dynamics and the use of props, fabrics, lights and sound.         Miss Koner was married to the conductor Fritz Mahler from 1939 until his death in 1973. She received a Dance Magazine Award in 1964 and wrote for many dance publications.         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  February 12, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the dancer Pauline Koner on Friday referred incorrectly to the José Limón Dance Company, in which she was a principal in the 1940's and 50's. It remains a leading modern-dance company; its prominence was not limited to those decades.       
         Inna Zubkovskaya, a leading ballerina in the Kirov Ballet when that Russian company first appeared in the West, died on Feb. 5 in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 77.         The Kirov was at a peak but unfamiliar to ballet audiences throughout the world until 1961. Ms. Zubkovskaya led the troupe in its United States debut when she appeared in the dual role of Odette-Odile in ''Swan Lake'' at the Kirov's opening night on Sept. 11, 1961, at the Metropolitan Opera House.         The company had performed a few months earlier in Paris, where it was rocked by Rudolf Nureyev's defection but continued on to London for its British debut. The depth of dancing at that time proved that the company from St. Petersburg was dependent on no single star but had an array of distinguished ballerinas, a stunning corps and other male dancers of superstar caliber like Yuri Soloviev.         Ms. Zubkovskaya belonged to the heroic generation of Soviet dancers that was responsible for the Kirov's impact in the West and who was deeply admired at home. She was prominent in the London season, where she was praised for her range and the mix of sweep and bravura in her classical style. Writing from London, John Martin of The New York Times called her Odette ''beautifully lyrical, always with a dramatic tone beneath the surface.''         Ms. Zubkovskaya was born Inna Izraelyeva in Moscow, where she graduated in 1941 from the Bolshoi Ballet school. Invited to join the Kirov, she danced with that company until 1970, performing in the classics and the premieres of major Soviet ballets including Leonid Jakobson's version of ''Spartacus'' and Yuri Grigorovich's ''Legend of Love.'' She had continued to work as a teacher and coach until her death.         She was married twice to fellow dancers, first to Nikolai Zubkovsky and then to Sviatoslav Kuznetsov.       
         Peggy Converse, a character actress whose seven-decade career in show business included films, television and more than 100 roles in more than 1,000 theaters, died on March 2 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 95.         Ms. Converse said she had appeared on stages in every major city in the United States and Canada and ''in most of the towns in between, any town that had a stage and would have me.''         She made the comment at 85 when she was paid for what became her final performance, a recorded scream that she said she had actually emitted for the 1958 low-budget thriller ''The Thing That Couldn't Die'' and that caught the ear of the producers of a new horror film.         ''The producers could not find anyone to scream the way they wanted, so they went back to the dark ages of film and heard mine,'' she said. ''You would have screamed that way, too, if you were in movies like that.''         Anyway, on the basis of hearing the recorded scream, the new producers decided, ''She's the one.''         Then they found out that Ms. Converse was 85. ''They, of course, realized they couldn't use me, so they used my voice,'' she said.         Besides screaming, Ms. Converse applied her talents to portraying leading ladies, ingénues, mothers, sisters and villains.         Her film career included roles in everything from ''Father Is a Bachelor'' (1950), with William Holden, and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), with Rita Hayworth, to ''The Accidental Tourist'' (1988), with Geena Davis and William Hurt.         Active in television from its infancy, Ms. Converse appeared in numerous episodes of ''Perry Mason'' with Raymond Burr, and on soap operas like ''The Young and the Restless,'' ''General Hospital'' and ''Days of Our Lives.''         Born in Oregon City, Ore., she began her career at 16, appearing as multiple characters in the ''Pilgrimage Play'' in Los Angeles. A 1927 graduate of Stanford University, she was a sought-after ingénue in the 1920's and 30's, appearing in Broadway productions like ''Infernal Machine,'' with Lloyd Bridges, and ''Comedy of Good and Evil,'' with Mildred Dunnock.         Ms. Converse played feature roles in plays like ''Othello,'' ''Wuthering Heights,'' ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' in summer stock companies from Tarrytown, N.Y., and Weston, Conn., to Santa Fe, N.M., and Carmel, Calif. She and her husband, the actor Don Porter, appeared together in the national touring companies of ''Any Wednesday,'' ''The Best Man'' and ''Love and Kisses.''         Her first marriage, to Edmund Converse, founder of Bonanza Airlines, ended in divorce.         She and Mr. Porter, whom she met at a cast party at the Carmel Playhouse, were married for 53 years. He died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter, the actress and singer Melissa Converse, and a son, Don Porter Jr., both of Los Angeles; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Smith Bevington, a poet, essayist, English professor and tireless tourist who roamed the world in search of her own Shangri-La, died on Friday at the home of her son, David, in Chicago. She was 94.         Mrs. Bevington was a professor emeritus at Duke University, where she joined the faculty in 1943 and retired in 1976. She was the author of 12 books of poetry and essays, including her last book, published in 1996, ''The Third and Only Way: Reflections on Staying Alive.''         A writer of light verse and memoirs that plumbed her own life, Mrs. Bevington wrote about her world travels, her romance and marriage to her husband, Merle M. Bevington, and even the small-town love affairs of her Methodist minister father.         Her memoir ''Charley Smith's Girl'' was banned by the library in Worcester, N.Y., where she grew up. And to interviewers, Mrs. Bevington professed delight with the censure of her book, which described how her mother divorced her father for carrying on with younger female parishioners.         ''It's a place dear to me,'' she told an interviewer. ''It's an honor to be banned there. Nobody gets banned.''         Born in Afton, N.Y., she earned her philosophy degree from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in English from Columbia University. There she met her husband in a class in romanticism in 1927. They married, saved up $1,500 to travel and roamed the globe until they returned to New York to face the stock market crash in 1929.         Eventually the couple settled in Durham, N.C., where her husband also joined the Duke University faculty. In addition to her son, she is survived by five grandchildren.         In her 70's she traveled the world again, writing about her quixotic quest ''in search of something -- call it a bo tree, or Shangri-La, or earthly paradise -- which is only another name for peace itself and these days is decidedly a fool's errand.''       
         Denny Griswold, founder and former editor of the newsletter Public Relations News, died on Feb. 7 in Norwalk, Conn. She was 92 and in recent years had lived at the Wilton Meadows Health Care Center in Wilton, Conn.         Her newsletter was the first periodical to report on public relations, said Jack O'Dwyer, whose company, the J. R. O'Dwyer Company, publishes the rival O'Dwyer Newsletter.         Ms. Griswold said on various occasions that she had the idea for the newsletter in 1944, when there were no more than 25 formal corporate public relations departments in the United States and perhaps 100 companies that described themselves as handling public relations.         The newsletter, which is still published, has an international circulation, which it does not disclose.         Ms. Griswold was born Denora Prager in New York on March 24, 1908. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College and a master's from Radcliffe.         She joined the editorial staff at Business Week, where her first husband, Glenn Griswold, was the editor and publisher. After working in public relations, first at J. Walter Thompson and then at other agencies, she started her own agency with Mr. Griswold. He died in 1950.         In 1951, she married J. Langdon Sullivan, an investment manager, who died in 1995.         She is survived by three stepchildren, Diana Sullivan Spenski of Virginia Beach, Va.; Margot Sullivan Grosvenor of Newport, R.I.; and James R. O. Sullivan of Boston; 12 stepgrandchildren; and 20 stepgreat-grandchildren.       
         Maude Russell Rutherford, a singer and dancer in the glory days of black theater in the 1920's who always said she was the one who really introduced the Charleston on Broadway, died on March 8 at her home in Atlantic City. She is believed to have been 104.         Strikingly pretty, she was billed as the Slim Princess when she worked with Josephine Baker, Fats Waller and Pearl Bailey. Never a star, Ms. Rutherford was usually the soubrette or a featured performer and a great favorite at Harlem's Cotton Club.         She wrote her particular footnote to history in 1922 in the Broadway show ''Liza, '' an all-black revue with lyrics and music by Maceo Pinkard.  While many dance histories credit the 1923 show ''Runnin' Wild'' with bringing the Charleston to Broadway, Ms. Rutherford led the ''Liza'' chorus girls in the dance a year earlier.         She remained proud of her dance abilities to the end of her life.         ''I used to kick 32 times across the stage, and my legs would hit my nose,'' Ms. Rutherford told Jean-Claude Baker, who was reared by Josephine Baker and who is a student of black entertainment. ''I was a dancing fool.''         Ms. Rutherford was born in Texas to a black mother, Margaret Lee, and a white father, William McCann. With interracial unions prohibited, her parents never lived together.         As a teenager working as a ticket taker, Ms. Rutherford met Sam Russell, a star of the black theater with the comedy team Bilo and Ashes. He asked her to go on the road with him. She demanded marriage first. The marriage was violent and short. Ms. Rutherford, weary of being beaten, surreptitiously relieved her husband of $100, then struck out on her own.         Tall, with a sweet voice, she would play the bouncy, good-time girl, perhaps the comic relief. ''I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles'' was a youthful audition choice. Early in her career a producer tried to mold her as a blues singer, but, as Ms. Rutherford told Mr. Baker in a taped interview, it did not fit. The producer said, ''Honey, you stick to bubbles.''         Her style offstage was down to earth and no-nonsense, and she used language too vivid to be called plain-spoken; she described one colleague as ''so ugly she could take a stick and break day.''         Ms. Rutherford's theater credits included ''Dixie to Broadway'' (1924), ''Chocolate Scandals'' (1927) and ''Keep Shufflin' '' (1928). She left show business in the 1950's and in 1953 married her fifth husband, Septimus Rutherford, chief steward for the Moore-McCormack Lines. She worked as a switchboard operator in an Atlantic City hotel.         But she never lost her show-biz flair.         When her husband died in 1980, Ms. Rutherford had her name carved into the headstone she and her husband would share, as well as a birth date, Mr. Baker said.         But instead of 1897, which she had told friends was the year of her birth, the carved date was 1902.         ''She said, 'By the time I die, nobody will be here to remember, so I will go forever in eternity five years younger,' '' Mr. Baker said.       
         Margaret Tafoya, whose nimble, ingenious hands turned the chocolate-colored clay of her New Mexico pueblo into black-on-black and red-on-red pottery of such profound and graceful beauty that it acquired a global reputation, died on Feb. 25 at her home in Santa Clara Pueblo near Santa Fe. She was 96.         Her name in Tewa, the language of seven Southwestern pueblos, six in New Mexico and one in Arizona, was Corn Blossom. She was the matriarch of Santa Clara Pueblo potters, who are more numerous and produce more pottery than those of any other pueblo.         Her work, known for exceptionally large vessels, is exhibited in public and private collections around the world. She was named folk artist of the year by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984.         The art form she practiced has long been dominated by women, and Corn Blossom was the last of a group of women who attained fame through their mastery of it. Gone are Blue Corn and Maria Martinez of the San Ildefonso Pueblo, Christina Naranjo of Santa Clara and Grace Chapella, a Hopi.         Today Indian arts command astronomic prices and space on museum shelves in faraway cities, but fewer and fewer Pueblo Indians can speak or even understand Tewa. Mrs. Tafoya, though, was rooted in the old ways.         She spurned inventions like the potter's wheel. She kept chickens, milked her own cows, churned her own butter and rejected natural gas heat in favor of the traditional beehive fireplace.         After a brief fling with an Apache, she married a young man from the home pueblo, a distant relative with the same last name.         According to the Web site of the National Museum of American History (www.americanhistory.si.edu), Santa Clarans use the same word for clay and for people: nung.         Mrs. Tafoya always prayed to Mother Clay before working. ''You can't go to Mother Clay without the cornmeal and ask her permission to touch her,'' the museum Web site quotes Mrs. Tafoya as saying. ''Talk to Mother Clay.''         Though she was one of the last to make pots with handles and criticized others for adding semiprecious gems to pottery, she also liked to experiment.         She used different colors of slips, or thinned clays applied to the outside of her vessels, and her later forms were thinner, lighter and more graceful. Her shiny finishes became ever more polished. She even adapted Greek and Roman forms to classic Santa Clara shapes.         Mrs. Tafoya clearly loved her art, but it was also how she supported her 10 children who survived their first year; 2 others did not. As she said, ''I have dressed my children with clay.''         Maria Margarita Tafoya was born in her pueblo on Aug. 13, 1904. Her mother, Sara Fina Gutierrez Tafoya, or Autumn Leaf, was ''undoubtedly the outstanding Tewa potter of her time,'' Mary Ellen and Laurence Blair wrote in ''Margaret Tafoya: A Tewa Potter's Heritage and Legacy'' (Schiffer, 1986).         Her father, Geronimo, or White Flower, was mainly concerned with raising food for the family, but he was also the main marketer of his wife's pottery. He would load up his burros and make sales trips of up to 500 miles.         Five of the couple's eight children became excellent potters, driven and inspired by their perfectionist mother. Margaret's rigidly traditional approach was suggested by her insistence on using corn cobs, rather than sandpaper, for polishing.         She and her siblings made their first pottery when their mother tossed them pieces of clay. ''We get a piece of her clay and try to make animals or maybe bowls,'' Margaret said. ''We make these just for fun.''         Her mother allowed the young girl to sell her first piece of pottery to a Santa Fe dealer. ''I sure don't remember how much I got,'' she said in an interview in the book. ''It was a small piece, you know. It made me feel good. I felt I should make some more.''         Margaret attended the pueblo elementary school and went to Santa Fe Indian School.         She had to drop out of high school to help her family during the devastating flu epidemic of 1918. In 1924 she married Alcario Tafoya, a professional cook who was also related to famous potters. He carved decorations on Margaret's works but never signed them.         In the 1930's and 40's the Tafoyas often exchanged pottery for children's clothing. Mrs. Tafoya returned to work as soon as possible after the birth of each of her children.         At first she and her husband took her pottery to cities and fairs to sell. Then, tourists arrived in buses and cars to buy it directly. In the 1950's the family become friends with the owner of a resort at Royal Gorge on the front range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. He persuaded them to be resident Indians each summer. They would dance and sell pottery.         As the value of Indian art skyrocketed, such direct selling was no longer necessary. Dealers today place blind orders for anything they can get by the best-known potters. But Mrs. Tafoya enjoyed attending group shows simply to see what others were doing.         In 1977 she visited a gallery show in Santa Fe that included 51 potters from 11 tribes. Afterward she invited the great Hopi potter Grace Chapella, then 103, to her home. The two conversed in old Tewa, which is to today's Tewa what Elizabethan English is to modern English.         ''The Tafoya daughters were told that it was rude to interrupt with questions, so they missed much of the conversation,'' the Blairs said in their book.         Mrs. Tafoya once said that she learned to make pottery ''just by watching my Grandma,'' and most of her own children and grandchildren learned the same way.         She is survived by six daughters, Virginia Ebelacker, Jennie Trammel, Toni Roller, LuAnn Tafoya, Mary Esther Archuleta and Shirley Tafoya; three sons, Leonardo, Wayne and Phillip; 30 grandchildren; 45 great-grandchildren; and 11 great-great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Tafoya never used the words ''when I die,'' saying instead, ''if I die.''         And she does live, in clay and in blood. ''The children, I'm proud of them because they like to do this pottery,'' she said.       
         Dame Ninette de Valois, the founder of England's Royal Ballet and a major British choreographer, died yesterday at her home in London. She was 102.         With keen vision and unflagging energy, Dame Ninette guided one of the 20th century's greatest ballet companies.         It was under her directorship, from 1931 to 1963, that the troupe made its United States debut with Margot Fonteyn in 1949. As a choreographer, she experimented widely, yet regarded classical ballet as the basis for dance training. Her works often looked Expressionistic or grotesque, and she had dancers perform in bare feet as well as in toe shoes, but all were rooted in the academic ballet tradition and could be performed only by classical dancers.         Most of her best-known creations date from the 1930's. ''Job'' (1931) was inspired by William Blake's illustrations for the biblical story. ''Bar aux Folies-Bergère'' (1934) derived from the Manet painting of a Parisian nightspot. ''The Rake's Progress'' (1935) brought to life Hogarth's series of paintings showing a fashionable young man's decline into debauchery and madness. ''Checkmate'' (1937) was an allegorical chess game between love and death.         Despite her love of art as source material, Dame Ninette's ballets were more than living pictures. Theatrically vivid, they were also thoughtfully conceived. As early as 1928, Dancing Times, a British magazine, called her ''essentially a choreographer who thinks.''         When her death was announced by the Royal Ballet, Sir Anthony Dowell, the company's director, offered a tribute to Madam, as Dame Ninette was known to generations of dancers: ''Through her achievements she will remain a source of inspiration and encouragement as she has been throughout her life to so many of us as dancer, choreographer, director, teacher and mentor.''         The daughter of an English Army officer, she was born Edris Stannus in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1898; her family moved to England when she was 10. She once recalled that as a girl, she was reserved, obstinate and ''capable of the sulks.'' Later in life, a medical examination revealed that she had survived undetected childhood polio.         She enjoyed ballroom dance classes, and her mother, who invented Ninette de Valois as a stage name, considered her talented. At age 12, she was sent to the Lila Field Academy, a London theatrical school. She danced in London productions and studied with some of the major teachers of the day, including Edouard Espinosa, Nicholas Legat and Enrico Cecchetti. When almost every British seaside resort boasted  a theater, she toured the country until, as she later joked, she felt as if she had ''danced the 'Dying Swan' on every pier in England.''         In 1923 she joined Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, remaining with it for three years.         Returning to London in 1926, Miss de Valois opened a school and began to build what eventually became a national ballet company. She was soon involved with three important theater groups: the Old Vic in London, the Festival Theater in Cambridge and the Abbey Theater in Dublin. For them, she staged dances in plays, taught classes and presented dance programs. At the Abbey she worked with William Butler Yeats on some of his plays that combined poetry and dance.         On May 5, 1931, her dancers from the Old Vic offered their first full program, and a company was born. Called the Vic-Wells Ballet (after the jointly managed Old Vic theater and the Sadler's Wells, where the company originally performed), the troupe became the Sadler's Wells Ballet when all its performances were at that theater. It kept that name in 1946 when it moved to the Royal Opera House and in 1949 when it made its New York debut.         After the company settled into the Royal Opera House, Miss de Valois  established a second company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, at Sadler's Wells. This troupe was reorganized in several forms over the years and was the forerunner of today's Birmingham Royal Ballet, a major British company.         The original London company was renamed the Royal Ballet when it received a royal charter in 1956. Dame Ninette, who was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1951, remained its director only until 1963. Yet, for the rest of her life she helped guide the policies of the company and its affiliated school.         Although she choreographed less as her administrative duties increased, she remained an esteemed choreographer. She also offered directorial advice at the founding of the Turkish State Ballet in 1947 and choreographed for it on occasion until 1966.         She was considered a strict disciplinarian in the classroom, yet she was a witty conversationalist and, during her stage career, excelled in comic roles. Dame Ninette also wrote poetry, although she seldom published it. However, in 1985 the Sadler's Wells Trust issued ''The Cycle,'' a volume of her poetry, with all proceeds from its sale going to the Sadler's Wells Development Appeal.         As she became frail in later years, Dame Ninette spent most of her time at home. She was frequently visited by dance colleagues and her choreography was revived to the acclaim of new audiences. In 1993 there were two successful revivals: ''Checkmate,'' produced by the Royal Ballet, and a triumphant staging of ''Job'' by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, which was danced in theaters and in Coventry Cathedral. Dame Ninette attended the opening performance of ''Job'' when the Birmingham company had a season at Covent Garden that July, and she and her ballet received an ovation.         In 1998, to celebrate Dame Ninette's 100th birthday, the Royal Ballet offered ''The Rake's Progress'' as part of a gala program that included excerpts from some of her other works, and the Birmingham Ballet revived ''The Prospect Before Us'' (1940), a comedy about the rivalry between two 18th-century theater managers.         Dame Ninette always kept her private and public lives separate. In ''Come Dance With Me,'' an autobiography published in 1957, she noted that she was married in 1935, but not once in the book did she mention her husband's name: Dr. Arthur Connell, a physician who died in 1987. She left no survivors.         Dame Ninette was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1950, and received the Erasmus Prize (1974), the Society of West End Theaters' Special Award (1992), the Dance Magazine Award (1998) and honorary degrees from London (1947), Reading (1951), Oxford (1955), Aberdeen (1958) and Cambridge (1992) universities. In 1980 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Companions of Honor, for those who have done ''conspicuous national service.''       
         Ann Sothern, a deft comedian and talented singer who was known as the Queen of the B's at Columbia and RKO, where she made 18 movies between 1934 and 1936, died on Thursday at her home in Ketchum, Idaho. She was 92.         Perhaps never the star she might have been, Ms. Sothern was nevertheless one of the shrewdest actresses around. Her astuteness would eventually lead to her ownership of two early television series, ''Private Secretary'' and ''The Ann Sothern Show.''         In 1938 Ms. Sothern ditched her blond ingénue image and stormed Hollywood's greatest studio, MGM, only to be stuck in a wildly successful series of 10 movies about a tough, scatterbrained, down-on-her-luck Brooklyn chorus girl with a heart of gold, Maisie Ravier.         ''Maisie'' (1939), which had been bought for Jean Harlow and then shelved when Harlow died, was an instant phenomenon. Letters addressed to ''Maisie, U.S.A.'' had no trouble being delivered. After ''Congo Maisie'' (1940), ''Gold Rush Maisie'' (1940), ''Ringside Maisie'' (1941) and ''Maisie Was a Lady'' (1941) and between ''Swing Shift Maisie'' (1943) and ''Undercover Maisie'' (1947), Ms. Sothern begged the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, to allow her to quit the series. Mr. Mayer always answered: ''No. Your movies pay for our mistakes.''         Through bad luck or fate, Ms. Sothern was never more than a minor star: ''a Hollywood princess,'' she once said, ''not a Hollywood queen.''         Joseph Mankiewicz, the Academy Award-winning director who cast Ms. Sothern in her best role, as the soap opera-writing wife of Kirk Douglas in ''A Letter to Three Wives'' (1949), said of her: ''Poor Annie. Annie was a damned good Broadway musical comedy actress.  She had the sexiest mouth any woman ever had. But, at Metro, poor Annie got stuck in the Sam Katz unit.  She never got the big break Gene Kelly and others did, of being with the Arthur Freed steamroller of talent.''         Ms. Sothern got a few chances to show off her her talent, her timing and her figure in MGM musicals, most notably ''Lady Be Good'' (1941) and in the Ethel Merman role in the film version of the Cole Porter musical comedy ''Panama Hattie'' (1942). And she got good reviews as a hard-boiled ex-waitress pressed into service as a nurse and doomed when the island of Bataan was conquered by the Japanese in the World War II drama ''Cry Havoc'' (1943). But it would be 35 years after ''Cry Havoc'' before she earned her sole Academy Award nomination.         In 1988, at the age of 79, she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her performance as Lillian Gish's optimistic friend and neighbor in the 1987 drama of old age, ''The Whales of August.''         A few months before the nominations were announced, Ms. Sothern told an interviewer that her chances were dismal. ''I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,'' she said. ''Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all. I was too independent. How dare a woman be competitive or produce her own shows?''         Like her friend Lucille Ball, Ms. Sothern turned early to television. In  their B-movie days at RKO, the two actresses had cried on each other's  shoulders, with Ms. Sothern complaining that she got all the roles Katharine Hepburn did not want and Ms. Ball saying that she got all the parts Ms. Sothern did not want.         Ms. Sothern was savvy enough to produce ''Private Secretary,'' and to demand that the situation comedy be shot on film, to preserve it. As Susie McNamera, private secretary to a New York talent agent, Ms. Sothern became a heroine to secretaries all over America. The show alternated Sunday nights on CBS with ''The Jack Benny Show'' from February 1953 to September 1957.         When Ms. Sothern quarreled with the show's other producer over her right to take on movie roles, she left the series and sold her 104 episodes for well over $1 million. She immediately returned to CBS in ''The Ann Sothern Show'' as the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel.  Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, was a guest star on the first episode, and Ms. Sothern returned the favor several times as the Countess Framboise on ''I Love Lucy.'' In 1989, 28 years after ''The Ann Sothern Show'' went off the air, the actress sold the rights to the cable channel Nickelodeon, where the show became an unexpected hit.         Ann Sothern was born Harriette Lake on Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., where her mother, a concert singer, was on tour. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Walter and Annette Yde-Lake. Of Danish stock, she was raised in Minnesota by her mother and grandmother after her father, a meat salesman and womanizer, deserted the family when she was 5.         At 16 she was named the outstanding high school composer in Minnesota and sent to Detroit to represent Minnesota in a national contest. She spent a year at the University of Washington before joining her mother, who was a singing teacher in Hollywood. When half a dozen bit parts in movies got her nowhere, she tried Broadway with somewhat more success.         Florenz Ziegfeld offered her a part in ''Smiles'' with Marilyn Miller, but the star considered the 20-year-old Ms. Sothern too much competition and had her fired after the Boston tryout. In 1931 she played the ingenue in ''Everybody's Welcome,'' the play that introduced the song ''As Time Goes By''; she then toured for seven months in the George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind-Ira and George Gershwin musical ''Of Thee I Sing.''  After the tour ended she took over the same role on Broadway, replacing Lois Moran. And Hollywood noticed.         She was signed by Columbia Studios, which changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair color from red to platinum blond. From ''Let's Fall in Love'' in 1933 through ''The Hell Cat,'' ''Blind Date'' and ''Kid Millions'' with Eddie Cantor in 1934, the Maurice Chevalier musical ''Folies-Bergère'' in 1935 and a dozen more lightweight but pleasant musicals and comedies, she bubbled and sang.         Married to the bandleader Rogert Pryor and living in a huge rented house in Beverly Hills, she decided she had had enough of B movies. ''I found a much smaller house in Hollywood,'' she recalled. ''We lived cautiously, not as extravagantly, for a year. I was just so sick of those pictures, I decided I wasn't going to do them anymore.''         After making seven movies in 1937, she was off the screen until 1939, when she returned with fourth billing in an A movie, MGM's ''Trade Winds,'' as Fredric March's manipulative secretary. When he saw ''Trade Winds,'' Walter Ruben, the producer of ''Maisie,'' refused to cast one of MGM's contract actresses as Maisie; he insisted on Ann Sothern for the role that would define her career for the next decade.         In 1950, with her MGM contract coming to an end, she collapsed on the ski slopes at Sun Valley, Idaho, with a near-fatal case of hepatitis and was in and out of hospitals for a year. She had divorced Pryor in 1942. In 1943 she married the actor Robert Sterling and had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Her movie career was essentially over, too, although she had solid parts in Gore Vidal's satirical political drama, ''The Best Man,'' and the Olivia de Havilland thriller ''Lady in a Cage,'' both in 1964. In 1965 she played her most bizarre role, as the voice of the mother of Jerry Van Dyke reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile in the television series ''My Mother the Car.''         Like many former stars she turned eventually to summer stock and dinner theater, with disastrous results. In 1974 on a stage in Jacksonville, Fla., falling scenery broke her back and smashed the nerves in her legs. She finished the performance, held together with silver gaffer's tape.         Told she would probably never walk again, she refused to accept the diagnosis. Immensely athletic, she was a crack trap shooter and deep sea fisherman, and her MGM contract gave her three months off each winter to ski in Sun Valley. She never came to terms with what the accident had done to her body. But she did walk, with a cane that she used reluctantly and constantly misplaced. And, a decade after the accident, she moved out of Southern California to Ketchum, where she could see Dollar Mountain, which she used to ski, through the window of her house.         A different kind of accident brought her one more chance for glory. The producer of a television remake of ''A Letter to Three Wives'' thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars, Jeanne Crain or Ms. Sothern, to play a cameo role. Ms. Sothern's bit part let Lindsay Anderson, the director who would be making ''The Whales of August,'' know that Ms. Sothern was still alive.         Mr. Anderson had retained ''a memory of her charm'' from Ms. Sothern's early musicals. ''In a sense she was too good an actress to be a star,'' he said. ''Being a star requires elephantiasis of the ego.''         Ms. Sothern is survived by her  daughter, Tisha Sterling, an actress and designer; a sister, Sally Adams of Boise, Idaho; and a granddaughter.         Summing up her career after ''The Whales of August,'' Ms. Sothern shook her graying gold ringlets and said, ''I've done everything but play rodeos.''         Correction:  March 20, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the actress Ann Sothern on Saturday misidentified the distributor of ''Trade Winds,'' a 1938 film in which she played a supporting role. It was United Artists, not MGM.         Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the television show on which she appeared as the Countess Framboise. It was ''The Lucy Show,'' not ''I Love Lucy.''       
         Irina Bugrimova, a Russian animal tamer who taught lions to walk a tightrope in circuses, died on Feb. 20 in Moscow. She was 90.         Ms. Bugrimova was the first Russian woman to train lions and tigers, as well as a liger, a cross between the two. She wore deerskin trousers and short boots when she performed, and appeared for 45 years with the Moscow State Circus, the Circus Humberto in Czechoslovakia and the East German State Circus, among others.         She was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, on March 13, 1910. She was first a ballet dancer, then a speed-skating champion. She became a movie stunt woman, then a motorcycle racer. Her early lion-taming acts used motorcycles. In one stunt, a lion would run in front of her motorcycle as if in fear, while another would jump onto the rear of her seat to ride along.         A Russian newspaper, Kultura, described how she flirted with danger by swinging on a giant swing with a lion. At the end of the routine, the two jumped off the swing together and she fed the animal a piece of meat with her teeth. Her act ended with the lions lying down as she cavorted on a carpet of cats.         After she retired she wrote two books about the circus, and led the examination committee of the Moscow Circus School.         Russian sources did not provide information about her survivors, but The Daily Telegraph in London said she had been married twice, to Aleksandr Buslayev, her coach and acrobatic partner, and to Konstantin Parmakyan, a dressage rider.         Big cats attacked her many times, and it was the attack of her lion Nero in 1971 that ended her career. Despite a severely injured leg, she finished the show.       
         Josephine Premice, an actress nominated for Tony Awards for her performances in the musical ''Jamaica'' and ''A Hand Is on the Gate,'' an evening of black poetry, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was emphysema.         Ms. Premice, whose married name was Fales, also starred on Broadway from 1976 to 1977 in the musical ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.'' Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Clive Barnes wrote that Ms. Premice ''can almost make a feather boa come alive.'' Her other Broadway appearances included ''Mister Johnson'' in 1956, a play about Nigeria by Norman Rosten, based on the novel by Joyce Cary.         Writing about Ms. Premice's 1957 performance in ''Jamaica,'' which starred Lena Horne, the Times dance critic Jennifer Dunning described her as ''a razzle-dazzle lead performer who was hot flame to Horne's cool fire.''         ''A Hand Is on the Gate'' moved in 1966 to the Longacre Theater from the New York Shakespeare Festival, where it originated under the title ''An Evening of Poetry and Folk Music of American Negroes.'' Ms. Premice worked frequently for Joseph Papp, appearing in an all-black production of ''Electra'' for the Shakespeare Festival's mobile theater, which toured the city's boroughs in 1969.         She was also in the festival's 1973 production of ''The Cherry Orchard,'' directed by James Earl Jones.         Ms. Premice was in the original cast of ''House of Flowers,'' a musical comedy by Truman Capote that was choreographed by George Balanchine and featured Pearl Bailey, Juanita Hall and Diahann Carroll. She left the production before it moved from Philadelphia to Broadway, but appeared in an Off Broadway revival of the play in 1968.         On television, she was a frequent  guest on ''The Merv Griffin Show'' and a guest star on the sitcom ''A Different World.'' She also played Louise Jefferson's sister on ''The Jeffersons'' and appeared on ''The Cosby Show.''         Born in Brooklyn in 1926 to Haitian parents, Ms. Premice grew up in New York and Haiti and studied dance with Martha Graham and Katherine Dunham. She began her theatrical career in the 1945 production of ''Blue Holiday'' at the Belasco Theater alongside Ethel Waters and Josh White, the folk singer.         Ms. Premice's final stage performance was as Amanda Wingfield in the first professional all-black production of Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' at the Cleveland Playhouse in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Capt. Timothy Fales of Paris; a son,  Enrico Fales; a daughter, Susan Fales-Hill; and a sister, Adele Premice, all of New York.       
         Maria-Gaetana Matisse, widow of the art dealer Pierre Matisse and a driving force behind the foundation that donated his vast personal archive to the Pierpont Morgan Library, died on April 7 in Manhattan. She was 58.         The cause was kidney failure, said a spokeswoman for the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation.         Mrs. Matisse, who was known as Tana, was born in Vienna in 1943. Her father, Karl von Spreti, was a founding member of the Christian Democratic party in Germany after World War II. In 1956 he was appointed ambassador to Luxembourg, and in the 1960's assumed diplomatic assignments in Cuba and Jordan, and Mrs. Matisse spent parts of her childhood in each of those countries.         In 1967, after studying languages in Germany, Mrs. Matisse moved to London and then to New York. After working for several years in the art world, she took a job at the gallery owned by Pierre Matisse, a son of the artist Henri Matisse and a leading international dealer in modern art. In 1974 she and Mr. Matisse, then in his 70's and a widower, married. They divided their time for the next 15 years between New York, Paris and the south of France.         After Mr. Matisse's death and the closing of the gallery in 1989, she and his three children by his first marriage established the Pierre Matisse Foundation. In 1998 the organization gave Mr. Matisse's archive, which included extensive correspondence with Giacometti, Miro, Dubuffet and Henri Matisse, to the Morgan Library, where a portion of it is to be exhibited in March 2002.         In 1999 Mrs. Matisse established the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation, which is preparing a catalogue raisonne of the painter Yves Tanguy.         Mrs. Matisse made frequent loans to exhibitions from the collection of modern art she inherited from her husband. She participated in the activities of several museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Morgan Library, where she was a member of the director's round table and the visiting committee of the department of drawings and prints.         She is survived by two brothers, Arardo Graf von Spreti and Alessandro Graf von Spreti, both of Munich.       
         Maria Karnilova, a charter member of American Ballet Theater who channeled her comic gifts and vitality as a dancer into an award-winning career as an actress on Broadway, died on Friday in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         A versatile performer, Ms. Karnilova won a Tony Award in 1964 when she portrayed Golde, opposite Zero Mostel as Teyve, in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' She was also nominated for a Tony for her role as Hortense in ''Zorba'' in 1968 and was praised for her hilarious performance in 1959 as Tessie Tura, a stripper in ''Gypsy.'' She played Golde again in the 1981 revival of ''Fiddler.''         Ms. Karnilova's career after 1946 was focused on Broadway and television as well as opera and regional stage productions. From the 1940's through the 60's, these included ''Miss Liberty,'' ''Two's Company,'' ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Kaleidoscope'' and ''Bravo Giovanni.'' Nonetheless, she often spoke of ballet as her first love. ''There is nothing more wonderful than being onstage,'' she once said of dancing.         She started her professional career in 1927 in the Children's Ballet of the Metropolitan Opera and joined the corps when Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, was founded in 1939. As a soloist, she excelled  in comic ballets like Antony Tudor's ''Judgment of Paris,'' Michel Fokine's ''Bluebeard,'' David Lichine's ''Helen of Troy'' and Agnes de Mille's ''Three Virgins and a Devil.''         Ms. Karnilova was occasionally seen in classical solos, as in ''Aurora's Wedding,'' the last act of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' and in Tudor's dance dramas. (She was the former mistress in his ''Jardin aux Lilas.'')         In 1943, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, noted that she was originally listed in programs as Maria Karniloff but was now called Karnilova. Whatever her stage name, he was taken with her vibrant personality. When she portrayed the sixth wife in ''Bluebeard,'' he wrote, ''She dances the role excellently and plays it with charm and a nice comedy sense.''         When she was cast in the mime role of Giselle's mother in 1944, Mr. Martin wrote, ''Who should turn up but Maria Karnilova, of all people, playing delightfully and obviously having the time of her life.''         Ms. Karnilova was a soloist when she left Ballet Theater in 1946 to appear in ''Call Me Mister,'' a Broadway revue, and a series of musicals, many directed or choreographed by Jerome Robbins, a close friend from her corps days at Ballet Theater. In 1958-59, she appeared as a guest in ''The Concert'' in Robbins's short-lived troupe, Ballets: U.S.A.         Ms. Karnilova was born in Hartford on Aug. 3, 1920, to Russian parents, Phillip Dovgolenko and Stephanida Karnilovich Dovgolenko. After the family moved to Brooklyn, Mr. Dovgolenko went to the box office of Loews State, a movie house in Manhattan, and asked where his daughter could take ballet lessons. The cashier pointed to the Metropolitan Opera House, then on West 39th Street. Ms. Karnilova began studying with Margaret Curtis at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School and trained later with Fokine, Tudor, Edward Caton and Anton Dolin.         After appearing in small groups headed by Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, whose company was the nucleus of Ballet Theater, she danced with the Salmaggi Opera at the Hippodrome in New York and in ''Stars in Your Eyes,'' a Broadway musical. She then joined Ballet Theater and later appeared there as a guest in 1955-56 and in 1959. She was the ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera Company in the 1952-53 season.         Ms. Karnilova met her husband, the actor George S. Irving, in the cast of ''Call Me Mister'' and married him in 1948. He survives her, along with a son, Alexander of Oceanside, Calif.; a daughter, Katherine Irving Stark of South Salem, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.       
         Emily MacFarquhar, who applied a scholar's meticulousness to many years of reporting on China and South Asia, notably in more than 20 years with The Economist, died on March 18 in her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 62.         The cause was a brain tumor, said her son, Rory MacFarquhar.         Mrs. MacFarquhar, who traveled widely in Asia and whose reports and observations had a keen audience among scholars and foreign policy experts, also worked for several years for British television and for U.S. News & World Report, covering subjects like Mao's Cultural Revolution, the Bangladesh war of independence and women's rights.         Although her articles for The Economist carried no byline, her work was recognized and praised by experts in her field. She wrote at length about Chinese dissidents, often befriending them when they visited the West, said Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University.         By examining South Asia, Mrs. MacFarquhar helped focus the West on an often ignored region, said Amartya Sen, master of Trinity College at Cambridge University and a Nobel Prize-winning economist.         Jonathan Mirsky, former East Asian editor of The Times of London, credited Mrs. MacFarquhar with unusually good training before she began reporting in China, remarkable diligence and excellent contacts. ''She was a significant China journalist of her time,'' he said.         An early published work was a pamphlet in 1968, ''China: Mao's Last Leap.'' It was was one of the first detailed examinations of the Cultural Revolution. Mrs. MacFarquhar did not publish books, but worked on a book about former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. The writer could not conduct interviews for the book because of deteriorating eyesight.         Emily Jane Cohen was born on June 23, 1938, in the Bronx. She worked on school newspapers at the Bronx High School of Science and Wellesley College.         After college, the writer Irving Kristol, a distant relative, helped her land a job at The China Quarterly, a new journal. For six months, she was secretary to the editor, Roderick MacFarquhar. She then earned a master's in East Asian studies from Harvard, studying with John K. Fairbank, the historian and China expert.         After a year in Taiwan studying Chinese, she returned to the United States by way of India, where she ran into her former supervisor, who was covering Nehru's funeral. They were married six months later and settled in London, where The Economist hired her in 1965. Her routine was to make long interview trips to Asia several times a year, using reports from The Economist's extensive freelance network at other times.         In her last years in London, she also worked on a program on commercial Channel 4, covering politics from Northern Ireland, Hong Kong and British regional issues.         When Mr. MacFarquhar accepted an offer to be chairman of the Harvard government department, Mrs. MacFarquhar wrote for The Economist from Cambridge until joining U.S. News in 1986 as foreign editor. She later becoming a contributing editor.         In 1994, she helped organize a report on women's difficulties in the struggle for equality, ''The War Against Women.''         Surviving are her husband and son, both of Cambridge, and her daughter, Larissa, of Brooklyn.       
         Vera Sandomirsky Dunham, who wrote extensively on Russian prose and poetry, died on March 22 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 88 and lived in Newton, Mass.         Dr. Dunham, a retired professor in the Slavic department at Wayne State University in Detroit, also translated Russian poetry by writers like Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Andrei Voznesensky and Anna Akhmatova, and was a scholar of Soviet and Russian works.         Her books included ''In Stalin's Time: Middleclass Values in Soviet Fiction'' (Duke University Press, 1976). She was a longtime member of the editorial board of The Slavic Review.         In 1976 Dr. Dunham retired from Wayne State, where she had been a member of the faculty almost continuously since 1945. Then she taught for several years at Queens College. She also taught at Columbia and other universities.         After secondary schooling in the Soviet Union and Germany, she studied German and Slavic philology and literature at universities in Germany, France and Belgium. She earned her doctorate in Slavic philology in 1935 from the University of Erlangen in Germany and a further degree in 1938 from the University of Brussels.         Dr. Dunham came to the United States in 1940 and was an analyst for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington in 1944 and 1945.         She married H. Warren Dunham, a professor of sociology at Wayne State, in 1942. He died in 1985.         She is survived by a daughter, Eugenia Dunham, and a sister, Zoya Slive, both of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Alexander Sandomirsky of Orange, Conn.; and two grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Straight, a graceful and versatile actress who won both an Oscar and a Tony Award, died on Saturday in North Ridge, Calif. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif., for most of the last 10 years.         Because she came from a wealthy  family, the Whitneys (her mother was Dorothy Payne Whitney), she never had to act for a living but was dedicated to the art of theater. When she became successful, she continued to choose roles for their challenges rather than for their ability to further her career.         Onstage and in films, Ms. Straight projected an image that was dignified but with strong emotional undercurrents. She brought believability to whatever role she undertook, acting in classics as well as contemporary plays and movies.         In the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ''Crucible'' in 1953, she was the essence of Elizabeth Proctor. Reviewing the play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that both Ms. Straight and her co-star, Arthur Kennedy, were superb, adding that in performance, she was ''reserved, detached, above and beyond the contention.'' That role earned her a Tony as best supporting actress.         In 1977 she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her performance in Sidney Lumet's ''Network'' as the wife William Holden's character spurns. The role was brief but noticeable, behind the dramatic fireworks, a familiar place for Ms. Straight.         She had a variety of roles in plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen and Tennessee Williams. In 1982 she scored another film success in ''Poltergeist'' as a psychologist moonlighting as a parapsychologist.         Beatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, N.Y. Her father, Willard Dickerman Straight, was a banker and former official in the State Department. She attended the Lincoln School in New York and Dartington Hall Community in Devonshire, England, a school founded by her mother and stepfather, Leonard Elmhirst.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in ''Bitter Oleander.'' After she persuaded Michael Chekhov, Chekhov's nephew, to join her in forming an acting school and company, the Dartington Hall Players in England, they brought the troupe to the United States, where she performed in Shakespeare. Then she continued on Broadway as Olivia in ''Twelfth Night,'' Emily Dickinson in ''Eastward in Eden'' and Lady Macduff in ''Macbeth,'' with Michael Redgrave.         In 1948 she succeeded Wendy Hiller as Catherine Sloper in the Broadway production of ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square'' in which she played opposite Peter Cookson. After the run, she and Mr. Cookson married. It was a second marriage for both.         In 1950 Ms. Straight played the governess in ''The Innocents,'' an adaptation of James's ''Turn of the Screw'' produced by Mr. Cookson. In his Times review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Straight acted ''with force, sensitivity and old-fashioned charm, in a style that Henry James would have been compelled to applaud.''         She continued to act on and off Broadway, playing opposite Richard Kiley in Robert Ardrey's ''Sing Me No Lullabies'' and opposite Van Heflin in the Broadway version of Rod Serling's television play ''Patterns.'' She also had the title role in Racine's ''Phèdre.''         In 1967 she was in ''Everything in the Garden,'' Edward Albee's adaptation of a play by Giles Cooper. In 1973 she played Mrs. Alving in a Roundabout Theater production of Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and in 1979 was Gertrude to William Hurt's Hamlet at the Circle Repertory Company.         Among her many television appearances, she was Goneril to Orson Welles's King Lear in an abbreviated version of the play on ''Omnibus,'' and Rose Kennedy in ''Robert Kennedy and His Times.'' In 1986 she was in Mr. Lumet's film ''Power'' and in 1991 played Goldie Hawn's mother in ''Deceived.''         Throughout her life, Ms. Straight was also a producer and teacher. As a founder of Theater Incorporated, she was instrumental in bringing the Old Vic, with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, to the United States. In 1981 she helped revive Michael Chekhov's School of Theater in New York.         Ms. Straight's husband died in 1990. She is survived by her sons, Gary Cookson, an actor in New York, and Tony Cookson, a writer and director in Santa Monica, Calif.; two stepchildren, Peter Cookson Jr. of Irvington, N.Y., and Jane Coopland of Hawaii; a brother, Michael Straight of Chicago, a former deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Despite her patrician background, Ms. Straight always regarded herself as a working actress. ''I may have been born in society,'' she once said, ''but I was never part of anything but theater.''       
         Nyree Dawn Porter, who entranced millions of television viewers around the world when she starred as the beautiful Irene, trapped in a loveless marriage in the BBC adaptation of John Galsworthy's ''Forsyte Saga'' in the late 1960's, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 61.         Her agent said she died unexpectedly but gave no further details.         Produced by Donald Wilson to coincide with the centenary of Galsworthy's birth, the 26-part ''Forsyte Saga,'' which recounted the lives and loves of an upper-middle-class merchant family in London from 1879 to 1926, was first broadcast in 1967 and went on to attract more than 100 million viewers in 26 countries. It was shown in the United States on public television starting in 1969.         For Ms. Porter, whose performance won her an award from the Society of Film and Television Arts as best actress and designation by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 as an officer of the Order of the British Empire, ''The Forsyte Saga'' proved to be a mixed blessing.         She said that afterward, BBC regarded her as ''our Irene'' and turned aside her agent's efforts to have her cast in other major roles. And her private life was shadowed  by her success and her travels as an actress. Her husband, Bryon O'Leary, an actor who had been a childhood friend and was often thrust aside by ''Forsyte'' fans eager to meet Irene, died in 1970 of an overdose of whiskey and barbiturates.         In 1976 Ms. Porter married another actor, Robin Halstead. Before they divorced in 1987, they had a daughter, Tayla, who survives her.         After ''Forsyte,'' Ms. Porter said, ''I waited for the movie offers to pour in, but they just didn't.''         Nevertheless, she remained busy. She starred in several British television series and continued to act on the stage and in films. In 1998 she played the ballerina Margot Fonteyn in the film ''Hilary and Jackie.''         Ms. Porter was born in New Zealand on Jan. 22, 1940. She was given a Maori name, Ngaire, meaning little heart-shaped flower, but for clarity she changed it to Nyree, its phonetic pronunciation. She left New Zealand for England in 1958.         In a few more years, her work in ''The Forsyte Saga'' would win her one critic's designation as ''the first romantic sex symbol of the telly age.''       
         Ida Fisher Davidoff, a family counselor and expert on aging, died on May 11 at a chronic care center in New Canaan, Conn. She was 97.         Dr. Davidoff took pleasure in debunking stereotypes about the elderly and continued to see clients at her home office in New Canaan until a few weeks before her death.         In lectures and interviews, she urged older Americans to exercise, nurture friendships and retain as much independence as possible while accepting the inevitability of physical decline.         Interviewed by the author Betty Friedan for her 1993 book ''The Fountain of Age,'' Dr. Davidoff is quoted as saying, ''The older you get, the more you get to be like yourself.''         Born in Boston on Aug. 30, 1903, she was the oldest child of Lithuanian immigrants. She graduated from Simmons College in Boston in 1924.  Later, she earned a master's degree from Radcliffe College and, in 1961, a doctorate from Teachers College, Columbia University.         In 1926, she married Leo Davidoff, a neurosurgeon who became one of the founders of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. He died in 1975.         Dr. Davidoff is survived by four children, Helen Hirsch of Englewood, N.J.; Leonore Davidoff of Wivenhoe, Essex, England; Frank, of Philadelphia; and Mary Houts of Hummelstown, Pa.; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Dorothy Burr Thompson, a classical archaeologist who was one of the world's leading experts on ancient terra-cotta art, died on May 10 at her home in Hightstown, N.J. She was 101.         Dr. Thompson researched and wrote extensively on Hellenistic terra-cotta figurines, small statuettes that were ubiquitous in Greece in the second and third centuries B.C. The figurines were traded freely and could be found in almost any Greek household. Archaeologists use them today in describing the culture and taste of the era.         Under the guidance of Dr. Hetty Goldman, Dr. Thompson worked on excavations in Greece beginning in 1924 at the sites of Phlius and Prosymna in the Peloponnesus and in Boeotia, a province in central Greece where she cataloged pottery at the site of Eutresis.         In 1934, she joined the staff of the American School of Classical Studies and became the first woman to be appointed a fellow of the excavation in the Agora, or civic center, of ancient Athens. It was there that she met Dr. Homer A. Thompson, assistant director of the Agora excavation, whom she married that same year.         Working together in Athens, the two were responsible for uncovering famous monuments like the garden in which the Temple of Hephaistos stood and the Odeion, or music hall, of Emperor Augustus's closest friend, Agrippa.         Beginning in 1950, in a project inspired by her love of gardening, Dr. Thompson reconstructed all 20 acres of the ancient garden and replanted olive, laurel, oleander and poplar trees in the garden.         Dr. Thompson wrote more than 50 scholarly papers and books on her excavation work, including the book ''An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora,'' published in 1971.         She also helped form the Canadian Classical Association and was a contributing editor of its journal Phoenix. She was acting director of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology in 1946 and went on to hold visiting professorship or lectureship at Bryn Mawr, Princeton and Oberlin and at the University of Sydney.         In 1972, Dr. Thompson was awarded an honorary doctorate by the College of Wooster in Ohio for her contributions to archaeology, and in 1987 she received the gold medal for distinguished archaeological achievement from the Archaeological Institute of America.         She received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr in 1931, doing her doctoral dissertation on terra cottas from the site of Myrina in Asia Minor. Her bachelor's degree, also from Bryn Mawr, was in classical archaeology and Greek.         Her husband died last May at 93.  Dr. Thompson is survived by her three daughters, Hope Kerr of Cedar Grove, N.J., Hilary Kenyon of West Hartford, Conn., and Pamela Sinkler-Todd of Philadelphia; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rita Hunter, the British soprano famed especially for her performances as Brünnhilde and Norma, died last Sunday in Sydney, Australia. She was 67.         Possessed of an immense voice, forthright and ringing, Ms. Hunter in her prime, which coincided roughly with the 1970's, seemed ready to take over from Birgit Nilsson as the world's leading Wagnerian soprano. In 1975, when the two singers appeared together at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Die Walküre,'' Ms. Hunter as Brünnhilde and Ms. Nilsson switching from that role to Sieglinde, it was as if the bequeathing -- or the challenge -- were being staged.         But the process stalled. When Ms. Hunter began to have difficulty controlling her voice, her gifts of native ability and robust good sense were insufficient.         Rita Nellie Hunter was born on Aug. 15, 1933, in Wallasey, England, where her father was a boilermaker. She had singing lessons with Olive Lloyd and Harry Burgon, and appeared in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' when she was 14. She also studied with Edwin Francis in Liverpool.         In 1954 she joined the chorus of the Sadler's Wells Opera, in London, and continued her training with Edward Renton. Three years later she joined the Carl Rosa Opera and married a colleague, the baritone John Darnley-Thomas. She found herself back in London when the Carl Rosa and Sadler's Wells companies merged in 1959, but before resuming her career, she won a scholarship that allowed her to study for six months with the great soprano Eva Turner.         After that she went to her husband's teacher, Redvers Llewellyn, and began to get important roles at Sadler's Wells, including Senta in ''The Flying Dutchman'' in 1964, her first Wagner. In 1968 she had a baby, but was soon preparing for the English National Opera's ''Ring,'' under the conductor Reginald Goodall.         That ''Ring,'' which began with ''Die Walküre'' in 1970 and was completed in 1973, was a triumph, thanks partly to Ms. Hunter's boldly sung and magnificent Brünnhilde. She went on to sing -- apart from her Met Brünnhilde in the spring of 1975 -- the title role in ''Norma'' in San Francisco in October that year and at the Met immediately after. Her other roles included Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' (New Orleans, 1978), Turandot (Welsh National Opera, 1979) and Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' (Welsh National Opera, 1980). She also repeated her Brünnhilde in the Seattle ''Ring'' of 1980.         She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1980.         In 1981 she signed a three-year contract with the Australian Opera, and sang Brünnhilde, Isolde, Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Aida, the ''Trovatore'' Leonora, Norma, and Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana.'' She elected to remain in Australia, and, though she did rather little stage work after 1985, was much in demand for concerts and recitals in Australia, Britain and the United States. Her autobiography, ''Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,'' came out in 1986.         Her husband died in 1994. She is survived by her daughter, Mairwyn.       
         Dorothee Metlitzki, a retired professor of English at Yale and a prominent scholar of medieval Arabic, Middle English and Herman Melville, died on April 14 in Hamden, Conn. She was 86.         Her most definitive work focused on the intersection of Arabic and English culture during the Middle Ages, but she was also known for her scholarship on Melville, Chaucer and ''The Pearl,'' a seminal medieval poem.         Dr. Metlitzki was born in Germany and spent part of her childhood in Russia, where her family fled the Bolsheviks for two years. She grew up in Lithuania. Although English was not her native language, she gained renown teaching and writing about American and British culture.         At Yale and elsewhere, Dr. Metlitzki was known as a riveting lecturer and storyteller who would regale her audiences with firsthand accounts of some of the 20th century's most turbulent times. Her father, an international businessman, was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks but later freed by his own workers. And Dr. Metlitzki herself left Eastern Europe just as the Nazis were coming to power and lost members of her family to the Holocaust.         When she was 17, she went to the University of London, where she became a protégée of Moshe Sharett, who later became the second prime minister of Israel. After receiving a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees, she moved to Jerusalem and took part in Israel's founding.         She was a co-founder of the English Department at Hebrew University, helped found a self-help organization for Arab women and traveled around the world marshaling support for the Jewish state.         When Golda Meir was prime minister of Israel, Dr. Metlitzki served in her government: she worked as press officer for the Foreign Ministry and secretary for the affairs of Arab women in the Israeli Federation of Labor.         In 1954 Dr. Metlitzki enrolled in the new Ph.D. program in American Studies at Yale. She then taught English at the University of California at Berkeley and became the second woman to receive tenure in Berkeley's English department.         In 1966 she returned to Yale and there, too, became the second woman in the English department to receive tenure. A philologist who spoke eight languages, Dr. Metlitzki taught at Yale until she turned 70 in 1984. After retiring, she continued to lead seminars and remained an active scholar until her death.         Among her published works are ''The Matter of Araby in Medieval England'' (Yale University Press, 1977) and ''Melville's Orienda'' (Yale University Press, 1960).         Dr. Metlitzki married three times. She is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, Ruth Grdseloff, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Sarah Tomerlin Lee, whose career in fashion, advertising, retailing and interior design spanned more than six decades, until her retirement three years ago, died on April 15 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Mrs. Lee, an imposing woman who was rarely seen without her pearls, came to New York in 1936 and quickly rose to prominence in the fashion world. Her experience writing advertising copy for a store her father managed in Utica, N.Y., paved the way for a job in the advertising department at Bonwit Teller, then a fashionable Fifth Avenue store.         For about 30 years, she shuttled between the advertising world, where she worked with Helena Rubenstein, Elizabeth Arden and Leona Helmsley, and magazine editing, where she became a colleague of major fashion figures, including Diana Vreeland and Carmel Snow. She was an editor at Vogue Magazine and then managing editor at Harper's Bazaar.         In 1960, she became a vice president of Lord & Taylor, in charge of advertising, promotion, display and public relations, and in 1965 she was named editor of House Beautiful, where she remained until 1971.         She met her husband, Tom Lee, in 1937 when she joined Bonwit Teller, where he was then display director. They were married a year later, and shortly after Mr. Lee left to start Tom Lee Ltd., a design company.         Mrs. Lee's career changed direction after the death of her husband in an automobile accident in 1971. She initially joined his firm to complete his contracts but stayed to carry on and expand the business, which concentrated on large interior design projects for hotels.         Under her leadership, the firm worked on the interior design of 40 hotels and inns in the United States, including the Helmsley Palace in Manhattan, the Willard in Washington and the Bellevue in Philadelphia. Other hotel commissions ranged from Canada to Australia.         From 1993 to 1997, she was head of the interior design division of the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, which restored Ellis Island and Grand Central Station.         Sarah Tomerlin was born on Aug. 18, 1910, in Union City, Tenn. She graduated from Randolph-Macon Women's College. Her survivors include two sons, Todd Granville Lee, of Boston, and Charles Tomerlin Lee, of Greenwich, Conn.; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         On behalf of the Fashion Institute of Technology, Mrs. Lee edited ''American Fashion: The Life and Times of Adrian, Mainbocher, McCardell, Norell, Trigère,'' a compilation of midcentury American clothing designers, published by The New York Times in 1975.         She was also president of the Fashion Group from 1960 to 1963 and was for a time president of the Decorators Club. She was a trustee of the New York School of Interior Design and a founder of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. In 1990 she was named a designer of distinction by the American Society of Interior Designers.       
         Lillemor Taylor Robb, chairwoman of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct from 1975 to 1989, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was in her 80's and lived in Slingerlands, N.Y.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Robb, a political independent who had had training to become a legal secretary, was married to Gene Robb, who was the publisher of Capital Newspapers, including The Times Union of Albany. He died in 1969.         She held posts in the nonprofit world before Gov. Malcolm Wilson appointed her to the Commission on Judicial Conduct when it was founded in 1974.         The panel was established by the State Legislature and Governor Wilson to uproot corrupt and abusive judges during a national movement for accountability from the bench. From 1961 to 1981, the 49 other states also set up judicial review groups.         Govs. Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo reappointed Mrs. Robb to the New York commission. Its other members elected her as chairwoman for seven successive two-year terms.         Lillemor Taylor Robb, known as Lee, was born in Stavanger, Norway, the daughter of the American consul general there. She grew up in Nebraska and graduated from the University of Nebraska.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria McGoldrick of Loudonville, N.Y.; Christina Robb of Sharon, Mass.; and Deborah Twombly of Cape Elizabeth, Me.; 11 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Anne Anastasi, whose influence is felt by every student who takes a psychology course and by anyone who fills in the answers on a standardized test intended to measure achievement, intelligence, aptitude, personality or creativity, died on May 4 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Dr. Anastasi, a former professor at Fordham University who remained professionally active until shortly before her death, was known as the ''test guru.''' Her 1954 text, ''Psychological Testing,'' is still required reading in undergraduate and graduate psychology courses and is considered a virtual bible for the field.         The book, an encyclopedic review of how tests are constructed, validated and interpreted, received wide acclaim for its lucidity and depth of analysis. It is in its seventh printing and has been translated into nine languages.         ''Every psychologist has heard of Anastasi,'' said Dr. Mary Procidano, chairwoman of the psychology department at Fordham. ''She really defined the field.''         Dr. Anastasi took a special interest in the question of whether tests could be created that were free of cultural bias, Dr. Procidano and other colleagues said. In the 1960's and 70's, While some in the field championed so-called ''culture fair'' tests, Dr. Anastasi argued that the claim that tests could be entirely unbiased was a fallacy.         In addition to her contributions to testing, Dr. Anastasi was renowned for her studies of individual and group differences and the interplay of biology and environment in shaping personality and intellectual development.         Dr. Robert Perloff, the distinguished service professor emeritus of psychology and business administration at the University of Pittsburgh, said that Dr. Anastasi, who wrote more than 150 scholarly books, monographs and articles, brought to the issue a balanced, deeply rational perspective and an insistence on solid science.         She also played a significant role, Dr. Perloff said, in applying psychology to real-world situations, both through areas like industrial psychology and consumer psychology and in the clinical consulting room.         ''Many academic psychologists would look down their noses at practitioners,'' Dr. Perloff said. ''She never did that.''         Born on Dec. 19, 1908, in Manhattan, Anne Anastasi was schooled at home until she was 9. Her mother was the office manager at Il Progresso, the Italian newspaper. Her father died when she was 1.         As a teenager, she was fascinated with mathematics and embarked on a self-education program, teaching herself, among other things, spherical trigonometry.         After two years at Rhodes Preparatory School in Manhattan, a school attended mostly by adults wishing to pursue college degrees, she was accepted at the age of 15 by Barnard College, where she majored in psychology and received a bachelor's degree in 1928.         Two years later, she completed a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia. She was influenced, she wrote in an autobiography, by the teaching of Harry Hollingworth, for many years chairman of the psychology department at Barnard, and by the writings of Charles Spearman, an English psychologist and statistician who developed the ''two-factor'' theory of intelligence.         At Columbia, she also met her future husband, John Porter Foley Jr., an industrial psychologist. They were married in 1933.         In 1930, Dr. Anastasi was hired as an instructor of psychology at Barnard, and she remained there until 1939, when she became chairwoman of the psychology department at Queens College of the City University of New York. In 1947, she joined the faculty at Fordham, and was promoted to full professor in 1951.         Dr. Anastasi's interests ranged widely, her colleagues and friends said, and she was constantly thinking about human behavior and the ways in which it could be examined. In a series of studies, she investigated creativity in elementary and high school students.         ''She collected drawings, poetry and everything else,'' said Dr. Marvin Reznikoff, a close friend and emeritus professor of psychology at Fordham.         She was also known for a certain indifference to the more practical aspects of daily life. Once, Dr. Procidano said, she heard a shriek coming from Dr. Anastasi's office. Running to see what was wrong, she found Dr. Anastasi trying to pry a plug out of an electrical outlet by using a metal letter opener.         ''Did you get a shock?'' Dr. Procidano asked.         ''How fascinating,'' Dr. Anastasi replied, letter opener in hand. ''How did you know it was a shock?''         In 1987, President Ronald Reagan presented Dr. Anastasi with a National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for scientific achievement. Other psychologists who had received the award included B. F. Skinner and Harry Harlow.         Dr. Anastasi was also active in the professional organizations of her discipline. In 1972, she became the third woman to be elected president of the American Psychological Association. Among numerous other awards, she received the American Psychological Foundation's gold medal for lifetime achievement in 1984.         No immediate family members survive her.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died yesterday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening gowns and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, including Steve Allen, Bennett Cerf and Dorothy Kilgallen. The panelists played a form of 20 Questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The show ran from 1950 until 1975.  Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR from 1960 until 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among the others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control. Oh no, that might ruffle his feathers, Ms. Francis replied. ''I used to call her jokingly America's sweetheart, because she didn't want to offend anybody,'' Ms. Bach said.         Her interview style was breezy. ''She was a very good actress, and convinced the interviewee that she really cared,'' Ms. Bach said.         Soon after the radio program was canceled, Ms. Francis began showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Bach said. She left New York six years ago and went to live in a retirement home in San Francisco to be closer to her son.         Ms. Francis also was a pioneer of morning television, appearing as the host of NBC's ''Home'' newsmagazine in the 1950's.         She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One Two Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, but television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''         But she said she had no regrets.         ''I got so much pleasure out of 'What's My Line?'. There were no rehearsals. You'd just sit there and be yourself and do the best you could,'' she said.         Ms. Francis was born Arlene Francis Kazanjian on Oct. 20, 1907, in Boston, the daughter of an Armenian immigrant. After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married the actor Martin Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter Gabel.       
         Helen Oakley Dance, a journalist and historian of jazz and blues, as well as a record producer, music publisher and personal assistant to musicians like Duke Ellington, Red Norvo, Chick Webb, Johnny Hodges, Bob Crosby and Earl Hines, died on Sunday in Escondido, Calif. She was 88.         Ms. Dance -- who often worked  with her husband, the jazz historian and record producer Stanley Dance -- began as a pioneering female jazz critic in the 1930's but soon began to play a role in exposing a wider American audience to jazz. She insisted on taking the music seriously, and from the start, as a habitué of the swing ballrooms, she distinguished herself from the jitterbuggers by watching from the sidelines.         During that decade, she wrote jazz reviews for Downbeat and other publications, worked for the management organizations of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong and promoted and booked Chick Webb's touring band. She also produced records for the Okeh label and organized the well-promoted swing-band battles at the Savoy Ballroom in New York, which became legendary events.         In 1935, as head of the Chicago Rhythm Club, a fan organization that  booked concerts, she persuaded Benny Goodman to hire the pianist Teddy Wilson, and to bring Goodman's group to play in April 1936 at the  Congress Hotel in Chicago. The event broke ground because it featured an interracial band and because it was one of the earliest American presentations of jazz in a sit-down performance hall. And while working for Irving Mills, Ellington's manager, she sold him on the idea of forming small bands within Ellington's larger orchestra. She soon become the head of artists and repertory for Variety records, which issued a series of recordings by these small bands.         Born in Toronto to a well-to-do family, Ms. Dance attended Ovenden and Trinity Colleges in Toronto and a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In the early 1930's she traveled to London, where she first saw  Ellington perform. Soon after, she rebelled against her family by moving to Detroit, where she intended to work as a jazz singer and later met  Ellington by forging an introductory note to him from a jazz critic. But by 1934 she moved to Chicago and found work writing about and helping to produce jazz concerts. She became a regular contributor to the new Downbeat magazine and was one of the organizers of the famous 1937 Goodman concert at Carnegie Hall.         In 1942 she volunteered for the Women's Army Corps and was assigned to Algiers, where she sent undercover operatives and radio technicians to occupied zones. Later in the war she trained renegade German soldiers as American spies.         Soon after the war she married Mr. Dance, whom she originally met while working for Mills, and they began their 50-year collaboration on  articles, histories and record productions. The family moved to Rowayton, Conn., and from 1964 to 1982, while her husband managed Hines, Ms. Dance ran Hicue, the music publishing company for Hines and Hodges. She also conducted interviews with jazz musicians for the Smithsonian Institution and Rutgers University. In 1971 she wrote ''Stormy Monday'' (Lightning Press), a biography of the blues musician Aaron (T-Bone) Walker.         Ms. Dance also worked in the civil rights movement, founding the Catholic Interracial Council within the Roman Catholic diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., and the Human Relations Commission in Norwalk, Conn.         In 1988 the Helen Oakley Dance and Stanley Dance Archive was established at Yale University, encompassing correspondence, writings, interviews, records, photographs and films; it will become available to researchers later this year. An oral history interview with Ms. Dance, conducted by Patricia Willard, a jazz historian, is part of the Ellington Collection at the National Museum of American History in Washington.         Mr. Dance died in February 1999.         Ms. Dance is survived by sons  Francis, of Woodbury, Conn., and Rupert, of Hopkinton, N.H.; daughters Theresa Bennink-Dance of Peterborough, Ontario, and Maria Lindley of Carlsbad, Calif.; sisters Jacqueline Hickson of New Smyrna Beach, Fla., and Doris Barry of Wilton, Conn.;  brother John Gillespie of Toronto; and three grandchildren.         ''The affinity with jazz which has determined my life was not inherited,'' she told the writer Sally Placksin in the book ''Jazzwomen.'' ''It was a gift. For the record, I was never really career-minded. My priorities were reversed, because I wasn't that hungry for gold. All my feel was for the music and the people who played things you wanted to hear.''       
         Carol Bernstein Ferry, who with her first and second husbands gave millions of dollars of inherited wealth to support causes like the Black Panthers, prisoners' rights and opposition to the Vietnam War, took her own life early Saturday morning at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 76.         After a lifetime of using money to make political points, Ms. Ferry made her final argument, for legalized euthanasia, by lying down as loved ones looked on and taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Last June, doctors told her that she was terminally ill. She had a tumor in her abdomen and failing lungs.         ''My decision has been arrived at after many years of contemplation, not quickly or casually,'' she wrote in a letter. ''I hope it will help others to feel all right about preferring a peaceful, benign path into death.''         At the height of her influence, she and her first husband, Daniel Bernstein, became known in leftist circles as the place to go for ''the loot,'' as she called it. For many years, she scoured the morning mail weighing requests for money for political causes. Sometimes she sent money without being asked. She visited many prisons, including Sing Sing, where for years she taught reading to inmates.         David McReynolds of the War Resisters League said her generosity was unconditional. ''They never attached a single thread to the money,'' he said.         Carol Underwood was born in Syracuse on July 29, 1924. She lived in Auburn, N.Y., until her parents divorced when she was 4. She grew up in Portland, Maine, and graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y.         In 1946, she moved to Manhattan to work as a secretary, copy editor and proofreader for McGraw-Hill and other publishers. She met Mr. Bernstein, a stockbroker with Loeb Rhoades, and they were married in 1953.         While he was recuperating from knee surgery at their Scarsdale, N.Y., home in 1956, Mr. Bernstein decided to work as an independent stockbroker. He considered himself a liberal and had earlier helped set up the National Scholarship Fund and Service for Negro Students, working with Jim Robinson, a Harlem minister.         According to a daughter, Katharine Bernstein of Brattleboro, Vt., she had not initially been leftist but became increasingly persuaded by her husband's increasingly leftist opinions.         In 1960, he suggested an Easter family vacation to Cuba. His wife at first demurred. ''Would you have gone before the revolution?'' he asked.         She said yes and agreed to go. The couple returned so enthusiastic about Fidel Castro's revolution that most of Mr. Bernstein's brokerage clients dropped him.         Their political sensibilities moved ever leftward. Mr. Bernstein bought full-page advertisements in The New York Times to protest the Vietnam War.         One of their philanthropic vehicles was the DJB Foundation, which Mr. Bernstein created in 1948 to hold his father's inheritance. At first, it was relatively inactive, as Mr. Bernstein funneled money out of pocket to causes that were not tax deductible.         With Mr. Bernstein's death from leukemia in 1970 at 51, the foundation received $6 million of his wealth. It then became more active.         Vincent McGee, who in 1972 had just left federal prison after serving time for resisting the draft, asked for money to go to Hanoi to bring back some prisoners of war.         She responded by mail: ''Dear Vinny: Here's a check for $3,000. I am glad to send it. There are three things about this money business: asking, saying 'no,' or saying 'yes.' The first two are hard, but the third is easy when the purpose is good and the funds are there.''         Mr. McGee went on to work for DJB and then other foundations.         In 1973, she married Wilbur H. Ferry, a foundation employee who wrote books on the problems of a capitalist society. The couple spent DJB's money by May 1975, as planned, and then gave from their personal funds. He died in 1995, and Ms. Ferry continued the mission.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Ferry is survived by a son, John Bernstein of Guilford, Vt.; four stepchildren, Dennie LaTourelle of Carpenteria, Calif., Fay Bisno of Norwich, Vt., Robin Ferry of Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, and Lucien Ferry of Blue Sea Lake, Quebec; and a brother, Arthur Underwood of Denver.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died on Thursday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening dresses and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, who played a form of 20 questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The actress, along with Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf, appeared on the show for 15 years, with John Daly as the genial moderator. Steve Allen and Fred Allen also were panelists for a brief period in the 1950's. After the original ''What's My Line?'' ended its run in 1967, the show was revived as a syndicated series the next year. Ms. Francis was the new show's only panelist from the old one, and it had a new host, Walter Bruner.         Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR in New York from 1960 to 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control.

Her style was breezy. ''She was a very good actress and convinced the interviewee that she really cared,'' Ms. Bach said.         Soon after the radio program was canceled, Ms. Francis began showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Bach said. She left New York six years ago and went to live in a retirement home in San Francisco to be closer to her son.         Ms. Francis also was a pioneer of morning television, appearing as the host of NBC's ''Home'' newsmagazine in the 1950's.         She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One, Two, Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, where her Broadway credits included ''All That Glitters'' (1938), ''The Walking Gentleman'' (1942), ''The Overtons'' (1945) and ''The Little Blue Light'' (1951), in which she appeared with Melvyn Douglas, Burgess Meredith and her husband, Martin Gabel.         But television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it, and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''         But she said she had no regrets.         ''I got so much pleasure out of 'What's My Line?' There were no rehearsals. You'd just sit there and be yourself and do the best you could,'' she said.         Ms. Francis was born Arlene Francis Kazanjian on Oct. 20, 1907, in Boston, the daughter of an Armenian immigrant. After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married Mr. Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter.       
         Yvonne Dionne, a member of the first recorded set of quintuplets to survive more than a few days, died on Saturday morning in a Montreal hospital. She was 67.         She died of cancer, said Carlo Tarini, a family spokesman.         When they were born in 1934 to an already large, poor farm family in Callander, in Ontario, Yvonne, Emilie, Marie, Cecile and Annette together weighed 13 and a half pounds on an old potato scale.         They developed from a single egg before the days of fertility treatments, and became instantly famous, seemingly a cheery miracle in the midst of the Great Depression.         But, isolated from playmates and their own parents, they did not share that cheer. Quintland, the residence-cum-sideshow where paying visitors could view them three times a day through one-way glass, outstripped Niagara Falls as a Canadian tourist attraction.         The Canadian ''Little Women'' brought an estimated $500 million to Ontario over the nearly 20 years they lived there.         They met the Queen of England, christened warships and graced the cover of Life magazine, but when Yvonne first left home at 19, Mr. Tarini recalled her saying, she could not tell the difference between a nickel and a dime.         ''Multiple births should not be confused with entertainment, nor should they be an opportunity to sell products,'' she and her two surviving quintuplets wrote in an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets that was published in Time magazine in 1997. ''Our lives have been ruined by the exploitation we suffered.''         The first inkling of their profit potential came shortly after their birth when their father, Oliva, signed a contract to display them at the Chicago World's Fair. Public outrage ensued, and the government took the ''quints'' from their parents' care. At Quintland, the doctor who delivered them, Allan Dafoe, became their primary caretaker.         But that did not protect them from becoming a sideshow. The Dionne sisters appeared in advertisements for everything from Puretest Cod Liver Oil to Lysol and Palmolive. Because the rights to their image had been sold, they said later, their parents were not allowed to photograph them and visits from Oliva and their mother, Elzier, were discouraged.         Meanwhile, Dr. Dafoe became one of the world's most celebrated doctors, writing newspaper columns on the quints' daily schedule and even about the pebbles in Callander, which were said to enhance fertility. In 1936 the quints appeared in their first of several movies, ''The Country Doctor,'' based on the life of Dr. Dafoe.         Even their exploitation, seemingly, was exploited, in books like ''The Dionne Legend: Quintuplets in Captivity.'' In 1965, the sisters published their own plaintive memoirs: ''We Were Five: the Dionne Quintuplets' Story.'' In 1998, they sued the government for the separation from their parents and won $4 million.         After a custody battle, their father regained custody of them from the state when they were nearly 10 years old. But in a second book, ''Family Secrets: the Dionne Quintuplets' Autobiography,'' published in 1994, the three surviving quintuplets said that he had sexually abused them, an accusation that their other siblings denied.         The sisters, raised Roman Catholic, were in and out of convents, both as students and initiates. At 20, Emilie died of suffocation during an epileptic seizure.         At 21, the remaining sisters each got $250,000 from a trust fund of their childhood earnings, and shortly afterward they took a determined stab at normalcy, moving into an apartment in Montreal and thus beginning a long estrangement from their parents.         Three of the sisters eventually married and had children, later divorcing. Marie, who had been hospitalized for nervous depression and had placed her two daughters in foster care, died in 1970 of a blood clot. Yvonne is survived by Annette and Cecile Dionne and five of eight other siblings.         Yvonne Dionne, considered the most artistic of the sisters, made several attempts to join a convent before settling in St. Bruno in the home of her sister, Annette. She became a librarian and lobbied the government on behalf of the Duplessis Orphans, children, many of whom were born out of wedlock, who were placed in psychiatric wards in the 1950's, Mr. Tarini said.         She also traveled to Europe and India.         Cecile Dionne once called Yvonne ''the most reserved and perhaps the most individual of us.''       
         Barbara Banning Tweed Estill, a New York civic leader, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         She served as the president of Big Sisters and for 25 years was on the board of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, where she focused on programs for the elderly and public social policy. She was a board member of the Leopold Schepp Foundation, and its president for 27 years. She interviewed applicants for college and graduate-school grants for the organization.  Mrs. Estill was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College in 1930.         In 1943 she married Harrison Tweed; he died in 1969. In 1980 she married Holland Estill, a philanthropies executive, who died in 1987.         Mrs. Estill is survived by her daughter, Barbette Tweed Hunt of Los Angeles and three grandchildren.       
         Imogene Coca, the saucer-eyed, rubber-faced comedian who teamed with Sid Caesar on NBC's ''Your Show of Shows'' and kept America's Saturday night television audiences in stitches for five years in the early 1950's, died yesterday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 92.         Her leer was superb, her wink epochal. Her eyebrow could rise to moronic bewilderment or descend to gold digger torch time. Her chin could jut out with the indignation of a dowager caught cheating at canasta or vanish into the pathos of an abandoned woman. And the wide, silent mouth could curl into almost anything: outrage, boredom, smugness, sweet innocence, and on and on.         To millions, that face -- elfin, mischievous, wistful -- was the funniest thing on television in television's golden age. With Mr. Caesar, who was the top star and got most of the punch lines, Ms. Coca spoofed movies, society matrons, marital bliss and everyday life with extraordinary pantomimes, with a chanteuse voice that seemed always on the edge of a screech, with toe dances that laid waste to Debussy's ''Afternoon of a Faun.''         A child of vaudeville performers who lived out of a trunk and put her on the stage as an 11-year-old song-and-dance girl, Ms. Coca drifted from nightclubs in the 1920's to variety shows and Broadway revues in the 1930's. She was often out of work until her television career began, and then it was rags to riches: $10,000 a week, a $1 million contract.         From 1949, when they began tickling television audiences in the ''Admiral Broadway Revue,'' the forerunner of ''Your Show of Shows,'' to 1954, when they split up, Ms. Coca and Mr. Caesar were one of television's most hilarious and successful combinations, reaching peak audiences of more than 25 million people that swamped the competition.         ''Your Show of Shows'' did more than dominate the Saturday night viewing habits of the American household. The 90-minute show started the careers of some of the nation's most successful writers and performers and set comedic standards that gave rise to Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin and others. For many viewers old enough to remember, the show still represents television comedy at its most inventive.         Sex, politics and religion were out of bounds for television comedy in that era. So ''Your Show of Shows,'' which also starred Carl Reiner and Howard Morris and at various times counted Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and Woody Allen among its writers, had to be fashioned out of the broader terrain of everyday life, which gave the comedy a timeless, classic quality.         Blending lunatic fantasy and more contortions than a fun house mirror, Ms. Coca caricatured the foibles of housewives, spinsters, opera singers, ballet dancers, pouting flappers and haughty socialites, while Mr. Caesar provided the stoicism of a luckless schlemazel and wacky foreign accents -- memorably, a fastidious Prussian with a ''geschmutzik'' monocle who dons a bemedaled tunic and braided military cap and barks orders at his aide-de-camp: ''Brushin' a Prussian!'' ''Perfuma-schpritzen!'' -- then marches off to his job as a doorman.         The sketches were never about very much, often just an idea: a wife trying to hide the fact that she has just smashed up her husband's car, a roof leaking on an elegant dinner party, a catered boardroom lunch that lurches into chaos over who gets the chopped liver as a slavering chairman lusts after a pickle wagged by his vice chairman.         In one pantomime, Ms. Coca, Mr. Caesar, Mr. Reiner and Mr. Morris were life-size mechanical figures on a Bavarian town clock, trotting out to strike the hours -- hammer on anvil, a splash of water from a dipper, a wheezing bellows -- until the thing goes madly, progressively to pieces, leaving all the quaint lederhosen figures drenched, battered and sprung.         In another, Ms. Coca was a wife posing for her amateur photographer husband, who could not quite satisfy himself about her face. Poking here, pushing there, he kept rearranging her features, which froze where he put them. Finally, he got it right: her left eye shut in a grotesque wink, the right following him around the room like a searchlight. The husband-and-wife routines -- dubbed ''The Hickenloopers'' -- became a staple of marital rapture and catastrophe.         In ''The Sewing Machine Girl,'' a sendup of sweatshops, Ms. Coca, with Mr. Reiner as a badgering, leering boss, worked faster and faster, drooping lower and lower, until at last she gave up, did a whirling dervish dance of consumption, collapsed in death throes and, sprouting wings, flew up to heaven on wires.         In ''From Here to Obscurity,'' a parody of Fred Zinnemann's film ''From Here to Eternity,'' Ms. Coca played the hard, innocent bar girl and Mr. Caesar her boxing-bugler soldier, tragic lovers in Hawaii on the eve of war. At last, they are alone together on a beach, in swimsuits under the moonlight. You can hear the romantic music, the waves rolling in.         ''I love you,'' she says passionately.         They start to embrace.         And water -- about a bucketful -- splashes in their faces.         ''I love you,'' he says gamely.         Dripping, bedraggled, shivering, she can hardly keep a straight face as another bucketful hits them.         ''There's one thing I have to ask,'' he says.         ''Yes?''         ''Did you bring a towel?''         Ms. Coca's musical satire came from a well-trained but not powerful voice. She could turn a Wagner aria into a nightmare of brow-knitted concentration, quavering glissandos and narrow escapes from tonal disaster -- just the reverse of a young singer approaching a difficult passage, the mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens once said. ''You're always deathly afraid the young singer will never make the last note,'' she said. ''With Imogene, you're always afraid she will.''         Her dance spoofs were also a result of years of training, and were far more subtle than most audiences realized, extracting humor not by stumbling around but by finely exaggerated professional movements. In ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' she traipsed off in amorous pursuit of a prancing satyr, eventually making her capture by pouring salt from a shaker over his little goat tail.         But it was Ms. Coca's flexible face and her talents as a pantomime that delighted most audiences. ''Imogene can look so abandoned that you wonder if she ever had anybody to abandon her in the first place,'' a friend said. And Max Liebman, who produced and directed ''Your Show of Shows'' for NBC, said, ''The great thing about Imogene is that one nostril never knows what the other is doing.''         At the height of her success, Ms. Coca, who won an Emmy as the best actress of 1951, was making $10,000 a week. After ''Your Show of Shows'' ended in 1954, NBC gave Ms. Coca her own half-hour show and a 10-year, $1 million contract. She was paid half that sum in the first year, but her show faltered and she gave up the balance of the contract.         Ms. Coca subsequently appeared in nightclubs, Broadway plays, films and many television specials. In 1958, she and Mr. Caesar were reunited for an ABC program that ran 18 weeks. And in 1967, ''The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris Special'' won an Emmy Award for the year's best variety show. But, critics said, the old Caesar-Coca magic was not quite there.         From 1950 to 1954, they had made 160 editions of ''Your Show of Shows.'' Those were the years before videotape, when television was live and programs -- classics or not -- vanished into the ether. But Mr. Liebman, the producer, kept ''Your Show of Shows'' on kinescopes, 16-millimeter films.         Last year, like a long-delayed punch line, the staff of the City Center in Manhattan found 47 dusty boxes of long-lost scripts and other memorabilia (but no kinescopes) from ''Your Show of Shows,'' the ''Admiral Broadway Revue'' and other pioneering television productions. They had been stashed away in a closet in an office suite where Mr. Caesar, Ms. Coca and their writers created shows, and had apparently lain undisturbed for nearly 40 years.         In 1973, Mr. Liebman and Mr. Caesar created and released ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows,' '' a selection of some of the best skits in a 35-millimeter enlargement that went into the nation's movie houses and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences. Videotapes have since made ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows' '' widely available to a new generation of fans.         Among its offerings, ''At the Movies'': A poor sap (Mr. Caesar) goes into a theater to relax. He chews 10 sticks of gum while eating handfuls of popcorn. A woman (Ms. Coca) comes in and sits next to him. She begins to squirm and fidget with her skirt. Soon, they are both squirming and fidgeting.         Her jealous boyfriend (Mr. Reiner) enters and accuses them of meeting secretly. The lovers quarrel. The sap moves over one seat, trying to stay out of it. To defy her boyfriend, she moves over and kisses him. (''I'll kiss the fathead if I want!'') Enraged boyfriend attacks unresisting sap. Finally, the lovers make up and depart, arm in arm, leaving the bystander mauled and in tatters.         In 1963, Ms. Coca starred with Jack Lemmon in the film ''Under the Yum Yum Tree'' and in a television comedy called ''Grindl,'' about the adventures of a maid. She later appeared in nightclubs and regional playhouses and in 1979 was in a Broadway revival of ''On the Twentieth Century.''         Imogene Coca was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 18, 1908, the daughter of José Fernandez de Coca, a violinist and vaudeville band leader, and Sadie Brady Coca, a dancer who also performed in a magician's act.         When the Cocas were not on the road, home was a tumultuous Philadelphia household where singers, dancers, actors, gag men and acrobats kept life in a constant swirl. An only child, Imogene spent her early years in the theaters where her parents worked. At the age of 5, she began piano lessons; at 6, singing lessons, and at 7 dancing lessons.         She went to school in Atlantic City for several years, but by the age of 11 was performing in vaudeville. At 13, she was singing in a slinky black dress at the Dixie in Manayunk, Pa., and at 15 was performing in Jimmy Durante's Silver Slipper Club in New York. She made her Broadway debut at 17 in the chorus line of ''When You Smile'' in 1925.         For years, she bounced from show to show, when employed at all. Finally she got a lucky break. Shivering in a chilly theater while rehearsing for Leonard Sillman's ''New Faces of 1934,'' Ms. Coca, a lesser light to Henry Fonda and other young stars, wrapped herself in someone's huge coat and began clowning around: a fan dance with flapping ends. Mr. Sillman saw it and put it in the show. The show flopped, but critics hailed Ms. Coca as a rising comedian.         In another flop, ''Fools Rush In,'' she met Robert Burton, an actor. They were married the day after the play closed in 1935. Mr. Burton, who became a record company executive, died in 1955. In 1960, Ms. Coca married King Donovan, an actor she had met on a summer theater tour. They often performed together in plays and variety shows. Mr. Donovan died in 1987.         Ms. Coca had no survivors.         A small woman -- 5 feet 3 and 100 pounds -- Ms. Coca was shy offstage, a gentle, unassuming, sensitive person, friends said.         Someone who worked with her remembered that once in the chaos of a rehearsal for ''Your Show of Shows'' on a night when the cast was tired and nerves were frayed, when lines were lost and nobody believed it would all come together for the cameras at 9, Ms. Coca suddenly twisted her face into an appalling moue.         The tension dissolved in an uproar of laughter.         ''She had the wonderful faculty of understanding,'' the friend said.         Correction:  June 7, 2001, Thursday  An obituary of the comedian Imogene Coca on Sunday referred incorrectly to a Broadway production of ''On the 20th Century'' in which she appeared. It was the original one, which opened in 1978, not a 1979 revival.       
         Lyubov Sokolova, a Russian actress whose roles in more than 300 movies in the years after World War II shaped the image of the Soviet wife and mother, died on June 6 at her home in Moscow. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the German newspaper Die Welt.         Die Welt said of Miss Sokolova that in the postwar years, ''None of her Russian women colleagues formed as she did the image of the woman -- which was also propagandistically polished up, to be sure.''         She was one of only three professional performers in the 1967 Soviet movie ''Asya's Happiness,'' set on a collective farm. One of her best-known films, it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1988. She also appeared in a 1965 Soviet movie that has been shown under the English titles ''Workers' Quarters'' and ''Workers' Settlement.'' It was shown at the Locarno Film Festival last August.         After Miss Sokolova's death, The Moscow Times called her ''Soviet cinematography's ultimate strong woman with a hard life.'' Her final movie, made last year, is titled ''The Agonies of Love.''         There was also drama in her real life. During the Nazi siege of Leningrad in World War II, when she was working in a factory and also training to become a teacher, her first husband, Georgi Arapovsky, and her mother-in-law starved to death.         After the war, when she had begun acting in films, she married a prominent director, Georgi Daneliya. He left her for another woman after more than two decades of marriage. Their son died in 1985.         Lyubov Sergeyevna Sokolova was born in the industrial city of Ivanovo, 198 miles northeast of Moscow. Her mother sold fabrics in a store. Her father was a carpenter.         As a girl, she was a theater buff and performed in school plays. In 1948, she acted in her first movie, ''The Genuine Human Being.'' As an established actress with a kindly face and large, handsome eyes, she was so helpful to fledgling performers that she acquired the nickname Mama.       
         Maria Chabot, who in the 1930's began the popular Indian markets on the Plaza in Santa Fe, N.M., and later became a close associate of the painter Georgia O'Keeffe, died on Monday in an Albuquerque hospital. She was 87.         Her goal was to be a writer, but her varied life included long periods  as a rancher, as well as acting as general contractor for the house O'Keeffe built on a hilltop in Abiquiu, N.M., which in 1998 was designated a national monument. She took the well-known picture of O'Keeffe on the back of a motorcycle titled ''Women Who Rode Away.''         The Saturday markets for Indian crafts eventually became a daily event, and today they draw more than two million people a year, spending millions on pottery, jewelry and other items made by Indians. But when the markets began in the Depression, the Indians were lucky to get a few dollars for pieces that now reside in museums.         The Indians lacked cars and pickup trucks to get to the market, so one of Ms. Chabot's first initiatives was to rent school buses, she said in an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican in 1996. After the first Indian market, eight of the vendors told her they were using their earnings to install running water in their homes.         Ms. Chabot began the markets in her capacity as executive secretary of the New Mexico Association of Indian Affairs, an advocacy group, with the goal of bringing broader awareness of the artfulness of Indian crafts. At first, the endeavor faced  intense opposition from local businesses.         Later, she helped Indians market their works more broadly by working for the Federal Indian Arts and Crafts Board, setting up cooperative marketing enterprises on reservations throughout the West.         She noticed that many people felt good about paying higher prices for Indian arts. ''Maybe it's guilt for what we did to them,'' she said in an  interview with CNN in 1994.         Ms. Chabot's paternal grandfather was the English ambassador to Mexico in the Mexican Revolution in 1910. His family, including Ms. Chabot's father, fled Mexico City, traveling by horse-drawn wagon. The family settled in San Antonio, where she was born in September 1913.         After graduating from high school at 15, she took a job as a copywriter. She then visited Mexico City to study Spanish and archaeology, making friends there with some New Mexicans. She moved to Santa Fe in 1931 at 18, according to John S. Hart, a neighbor and friend.         In her 20's, she made her way to the East Coast, took a freighter to Europe and spent two years traveling and working in France. She studied art and picked grapes in the vineyards of Provence.         After returning to Santa Fe, she took a job with the federal Works Progress Administration, the Depression-era project to find work for artists and writers. The agency provided her with a Model T Ford and a Brownie camera. Her assignment was to photograph and document Native American and Spanish Colonial arts and crafts.         She met Mary Cabot Wheelwright, the well-known collector of Indian artifacts, when she photographed Ms. Wheelwright's extensive collection. Ms. Wheelwright's collection of Navajo art is now housed in the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe.         For 20 years, Ms. Chabot managed Ms. Wheelwright's ranch at Alcalde, N.M. She hired the labor, supervised the cattle herd and oversaw the care of 1,500 fruit trees. She was president of the local irrigation association, an unheard-of post for a woman at the time, and adjudicated heated disputes over irrigation ditches.         Ms. Wheelwright eventually deeded the ranch to Ms. Chabot, who sold it in the 1960's to move to Albuquerque to care for her elderly mother.         In 1936, Ms. Chabot was named head of the Indian advocacy group. Her idea for the weekly fairs stemmed from visits to Mexico, where she saw that the Indians seemed better off than those north of the border. ''The difference was New Mexico's American Indians did not have a market for their goods and the Indians in Mexico did,'' she said in an interview with The New Mexican in 1996.         Part of her job was visiting pueblos, Indian villages, to encourage women, especially potters, to participate. One was Maria Martinez, the legendary potter of the San Idelfonso pueblo.         After her work with the Indians, Ms. Chabot was introduced to Georgia O'Keeffe by Ms. Wheelwright, beginning a friendship that endured until O'Keeffe's death in 1986.         She spent summers from 1941 through 1944 at O'Keeffe's house on the Ghost Ranch, 125 miles north of Albuquerque. Though her goal was to write, she spent most of her time managing activities at the ranch.         She often accompanied O'Keeffe on the camping trips throughout northern New Mexico on which the artist created many of her paintings. Among them is one called ''Maria Goes to a Party.''         In 1946, Ms. Chabot agreed to manage the rebuilding of an adobe hacienda on a hilltop in Abiquiu, 48 miles northwest of Santa Fe. She supervised the building crew and participated in design decisions for what became O'Keeffe's winter home.         ''I had never found anything as romantic as this beat-up building, a ruin really,'' Ms. Chabot said in an interview with The Albuquerque Journal in 1999 when the house was dedicated as a national landmark. ''It took six months just to get the pigs out of the house.''         She was married for six months in 1961 to Dana K. Bailey, a radio astronomer for the Los Alamos National Laboratory. ''We were much better as friends than as husband and wife,'' she told Mr. Hart, her neighbor.         She has no immediate survivors. A book of the hundreds of letters exchanged between her and O'Keeffe, with commentary, will be published posthumously, Mr. Hart said.         He said that Ms. Chabot was often astounded about the mistaken judgments of outsiders. One author said about how much the two women enjoyed riding horses. Ms. Chabot told her friend that she had never seen  O'Keeffe on a horse.         In 1996, when she was named a ''Living Treasure'' of Santa Fe, Ms. Chabot was asked about her wide experiences. ''You just live your life,'' she said, ''you don't try to do anything.''       
         Grace Borgenicht Brandt, a longtime New York art dealer, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 86  and had homes in Manhattan and Watermill, N.Y.         Ms. Borgenicht was a tall woman whose carriage and general equanimity were almost queenly. She saw herself as both a friend and protector of artists, and with her third husband, the painter Will Brandt, whom she married in 1960, she oversaw a busy social scene in both her Manhattan and Long Island homes.         She began her gallery in the early 1950's as one of a handful of New York art dealers to represent living American artists when most American collectors were buying European art. Although she would eventually show several European artists, she remained most strongly identified with a stylistically varied group of American artists, most of whom she represented for several decades, most prominently Milton Avery, but also Ilya Bolotowsky, Jimmy Ernst, Wolf Kahn, Gabor Peterdi, Leonard Baskin, Edward Corbett and Ralston Crawford.         Ms. Borgenicht was born Grace Lubell in New York City on Jan. 25 1915, and attended the Calhoun School. She became interested in art at an early age and enrolled in the New College at Columbia University, where the experimental program enabled her to study in Paris, in the studio of the painter André L'Hote, in 1934. Returning to New York, she studied printmaking at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 and earned a master's degree in art education from Columbia. In 1938 she married Jack Borgenicht, a dress manufacturer. The marriage ended in divorce, as did a subsequent one to Norman Sachs Jr.         She entered the New York art world as a painter, with her first solo show at the Laurel Gallery on East 57th Street in 1947. She soon became a key backer of its owner, Chris Ritter, helping to publish a series of print portfolios, starting with one of five etchings by Avery. In 1950 Ritter decided to close Laurel, and the artists Ernst and Peterdi, whom he also represented, urged Ms. Borgenicht to open a gallery on her own. The Grace Borgenicht Gallery opened on 57th Street in May 1951, with a show of Ernst's work.         Ms. Borgenicht held her first Avery exhibition the following October, represented the artist until his death in 1965 and then represented his estate until 1995, when she closed her gallery. She devoted more than 30 exhibitions to his work. During the early 1950's she also represented Gertrude Greene, José de Rivera, Adja Yunkers, James Brooks and Roy Gussow. In 1956, she moved to 1018 Madison Avenue and in 1981 to 724 Fifth Avenue. She continued to paint into the 1950's, was included in the 1954 Whitney Annual and had a solo show at the Martha Jackson Gallery in 1955.         In late 1954, she began an association with Margarete Schultz, the widow of the publisher and dealer Karl Heinz Schultz. Ms. Schultz organized an impressive series of exhibitions of works by the German Expressionists as well as Max Ernst, Wols and Jean Arp. Through her, the gallery represented the estate of Max Beckmann during the 1980's and early 1990's, organizing seven shows in 12 years.         During the 1980's and 90's, the Borgenicht Gallery gave first solo shows to young artists like Mark Tansey, Michael Zwack, Mark Innerst and Jane Rosen; began to represent Janet Fish; and held several shows of the work of Stuart Davis and Charles Biederman, American artists from earlier generations.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Borgenicht is survived by her sister, Shirley Black Cash of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Westport, Conn.; three daughters from her first marriage, Jan Schwartz of Los Gatos, Calif., Berta B. Kerr of Wilmington, Del., and Lois Borgenicht of Baltimore; a stepdaughter, Isabella Brandt Johansen of New York City; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Beate Uhse, who as a destitute war widow sold birth control pamphlets from a bicycle before going on to develop Europe's biggest emporium of erotic goods, died on Monday in a hospital in Switzerland. She was 81.         Her company, Beate Uhse A.G., based in the northern German city of Flensburg, said the cause was pneumonia.         She personified the revolution in sexual attitudes that spread across Europe during her lifetime. And her business career began in a time when selling contraceptives to the unmarried was illegal in Germany, as were sexually explicit materials.         Undeterred by scrapes with the law, she flourished when social and legal barriers fell. As staid German attitudes mellowed, her frank, humorous nature and business acumen gained her a degree of respect.         At her death she headed the supervisory board of Beate Uhse A.G., which had reported $100 million in annual revenues at the approach of 2000. The company is listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, employs 1,000 people and runs strings of boutiques and cinemas, a mail-order house and a film studio.         Her shops, which extend from Poland to Portugal, sell everything from contraceptives to sex toys, from movies to lingerie, though she drew the line at sadomasochism.         In 1996, Beate Uhse (pronounced bay-AH-teh OO-zeh) opened a three-story sex museum not far from the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. The museum contains more than 3,000 objects, ranging from kitsch to 17th-century Asian art.         Most recently, her business, ranked 79th among publicly traded German companies, was said to be taking a fresh look at the American market. And to counter the business's invasion of gasoline stations, German church leaders were envisioning setting up chapels along highways.         Beate Köstlin was born in October 1919 in what then was German East Prussia. As a girl, she idolized Charles Lindbergh and as a teenager learned to fly. Among the first women allowed to fly fighter planes for the Luftwaffe, she ferried aircraft to the front lines during World War II. She married another pilot, Hans-Jürgen Uhse, who was killed in the war, as were her parents.         At war's end in 1945, with the Soviet Army approaching Berlin, she flew north with her 2-year-old son and wound up with thousands of other refugees in a small town near the Danish border. She tried to support herself and her child by selling toys, but soon realized that the women around her needed advice about birth control.         The subject had been taboo in Hitler's Germany and condoms were difficult to find. So she bicycled from village to village with mimeographed sheets telling what she had learned from books and from her mother, who was a doctor, about the rhythm method.         She soon added contraceptives and used mail drops to advertise her inventory, which filled eight pages by 1949. The campaign covered West Germany and included brochures with advice on sex.         She bought a publishing house, built a printing plant and in 1962 opened her first shop in Flensburg. Others followed in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin, but it was in 1975 that the liberalization of West German laws admitted her to the big leagues of commerce.         Long shunned by conservatives and feminists alike, she claimed vindication in 1999 when the symbol of Beate Uhse A. G. -- USE -- crossed the board of the Frankfurt stock exchange.         ''What I am happiest about,'' she told the German news agency DPA that year, ''is that we have in the last 50 years succeeded not only greatly in business, but also in being accepted in society.''       
         Aveline Kushi, who taught and promoted macrobiotic cooking and helped found one of the nation's first natural food stores, died of cancer on July 3 in Brookline, Mass. She was 78 and lived in Brookline and Becket, Mass.         A macrobiotic diet emphasizes whole grains and fresh vegetables and generally avoids meat, dairy products and processed foods. The theory of macrobiotics is that such a diet provides physical balance that  leads to greater psychological and spiritual balance.         Ms. Kushi and her husband, Michio, also taught that entire societies could become disharmonious and aggressive from eating meat and processed foods, undermining world peace. But many doctors and nutritionists warn that a strict macrobiotic diet can be nutritionally deficient.         Christine Akbar, a spokeswoman for the Kushi family, told The Associated Press that Ms. Kushi had traditional radiation therapy after learning she had cervical cancer nine years ago. When the cancer spread to her bones, she was told that no conventional treatments were available. Ms. Akbar said Ms. Kushi then relied on acupuncture and Asian medicines. The cancer went into remission for several years, Ms. Akbar said.         Ms. Kushi was born Tomoko Yokoyama on Feb. 27, 1923, in the small mountain town of Yokota in the Izumo area of Japan. She taught in elementary school during World War II, but resigned to work for peace as a member of the World Government Association, run by George Ohsawa, who is considered the father of the macrobiotic movement. Mr. Ohsawa changed her name to Aveline.         She came to the United States in 1951 to attend a meeting of students who supported world government. She stayed to study at the University of Illinois and Columbia University. She married Mr. Kushi in 1954.         Mr. Kushi had also been a student of Mr. Ohsawa and shared Ms. Kushi's enthusiasm for macrobiotics. In her autobiography, ''Aveline: the Life and Dream of the Woman Behind Macrobiotics Today'' (Japan Publications, 1988), Ms. Kushi wrote that she and her husband discovered ''there was almost no good food'' in the United States.         ''We would have to make wonderful food available to everybody ourselves,'' she wrote.         In the early 1960's, the Kushis moved from New York to Boston, where they formed discussion groups on health and world peace. Encouraged by the interest there, Ms. Kushi opened Erewhon, a food store in Brookline named for a utopian novel by the British writer Samuel Butler. It was one of the first stores billed as a natural food store.         Ms. Kushi taught cooking and wrote cookbooks, helping to popularize Japanese ingredients like miso, soy sauce and tofu among Americans. Her cookbooks included ''Aveline Kushi's Complete Guide to Macrobiotic Cooking for Health, Harmony and Peace'' (Warner Books, 1985) and ''The Changing Seasons Cookbook'' (Avery Publications, 1987).         Her views were firm. At a class in Amherst, Mass., she was asked if a touch of garlic was permissible, The New York Times reported in 1980. ''Garlic is strong,'' she said. ''It makes one angry. Garlic causes fights.''         The couple founded organizations to promote macrobiotics, including the Kushi Foundation, the Kushi Institute and One Peaceful World.         Ms. Kushi is survived by her husband; four sons, Phiya, of Becket, Larry, of New York City, Norio, of Asheville, N.C., and Hisao, of Santa Monica, Calif.; four sisters, Miyako Okada of Tokyo; Atsumi Mimura of Hiroshima, Junko Asano of Japan, and Yoko Kendall of Worthington, Mass.; three brothers, Makota Yokoyama of Japan, Kyuu Yokoyama of Spring Valley, N.Y., and Masaru Yokoyama of Dallas; and 13 grandchildren.       
         Joan Bove, who helped make hair coloring respectable in the 1930's by introducing stylists in America to a product called Clairol that she and her husband discovered in Paris, died Saturday at Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Conn. She was 99 and lived in Manhattan.         In 1931, she and her husband, Lawrence M. Gelb, a manufacturer of chemical products, traveled to France in search of new business opportunities and came upon a small company, Mury, that was producing a new kind of hair-coloring preparation called Clairol.         Unlike other hair dyes of the day, which coated the hair and produced a painted-on look, Clairol penetrated hair shafts, producing softer, more natural-looking results. The product also had a foamy shampoo base and mild oils that cleaned and conditioned hair, and it was thicker than other hair color preparations, which tended to dribble.         Joan Gelb, a striking woman known for her keen interest in fashion, quickly realized that Clairol could potentially improve the self-image of older American women.         '' 'Middle-aged' was not in the vocabulary of French women,'' a 1982 Clairol company history quoted her as saying. ''They were at the height of their attractiveness and desirability when they reached 45.''         The couple bought $200 worth of Clairol and returned home to try it out at Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The store's hairdressers responded with enthusiasm, and their endorsement brought in orders from other salons. The two started the Clairol company, with Mrs. Gelb as president, and set up offices at 1600 Broadway.         But there was a major hurdle. Many American women colored their hair, but few would admit it, because it was considered vulgar. The service was done in fully enclosed booths, and some salons had a separate entrance for customers getting their hair dyed.         To promote the discovery -- the Gelbs called it a tint, referred to the process as hair coloring and avoided using the word ''dye'' -- the couple traveled throughout the country lecturing, giving demonstrations, talking with beauty editors and instructing hairdressers on how to use the product. The well-groomed Mrs. Gelb adopted the pseudonym Joan Clair to make her sales pitch.         ''In the early days,'' said her son, Richard L. Gelb, ''the way you got people to look with favor on hair color was through the beauty salons. You had to convince women that if you colored your hair, you weren't a woman of the night.''         Mrs. Gelb scored a major coup when she persuaded her friend Antoine, the Paris hairdresser whose clients included Greta Garbo and Claudette Colbert, to color several wigs with Clairol and place them in Saks Fifth Avenue's windows.         By the end of its third year, the company had revenues of $400,000;  revenues had more than doubled by 1938. But the Gelbs, who were still importing the product from Mury, worried about the possibility of a wartime blockade. The formula was in the hands of a German chemist, who sold it to the American company for $25,000.         By 1940, the Gelbs were divorced. Lawrence Gelb remained active in the company, retiring as chairman before his death in 1980; Mrs. Gelb's involvement with Clairol ceased after the divorce. Instead, she split her time between a horse farm in Almenêches, in the Normandy region of France, and a home in Wellington, Fla., near Palm Beach, her son said.         She was married and divorced three times. Her third husband, Emilio Bove, an executive with Alitalia, died before her.         In addition to Richard Gelb, chairman emeritus of Bristol-Myers Squibb, which acquired Clairol in 1959, and a former director of The New York Times Company, Mrs. Bove is survived by a second son, Bruce, a former Bristol-Myers executive, director of the United States Information Agency and American ambassador to Belgium; eight grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.         In her later years, Mrs. Bove, a brunette, began lightening her hair.  She never let it go gray, Richard Gelb said.         ''Right until almost the end, she was still coloring her hair,'' he said. ''She was a loyal customer.''       
         Eudora Welty, whose evocative short stories, notable for their imagery, sharp dialogue and fierce wit, made her a revered figure in contemporary American letters, died yesterday at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 92.         She was plagued by health problems and had been confined for some time to her home, where she had lived since high school and where she wrote most of her stories, novels, essays, memoirs and book reviews.         As a short-story master, Miss Welty is often mentioned by critics in the same breath as Chekhov, but she was  dismissed early in her career as a regionalist and did not earn widespread critical respect until she was no longer young. When recognition came, she accepted it with the ease, modesty and grace that had become her hallmarks.         She was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel ''The Optimist's Daughter.'' She also received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, several O. Henry Awards and the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and received the Medal of Freedom in 1980, presented, she said happily, by ''one of my great Southern heroes, President Jimmy Carter.''         Late in 1998 Miss Welty said she was ''excited and delighted'' to learn that she had become the first living writer to be included in the prestigious Library of America series of collected works by United States literary giants. The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.         For decades she was pigeonholed by critics who placed her with Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers as a writer of the so-called Southern School. Her reputation as a regional and apolitical writer was often cited as a reason for her failure to win a Nobel Prize. But her work, like that of those other Southern writers, transcended region and possessed a universal relevance and appeal.         ''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980. ''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''         A Clan of Readers         Eudora Welty was born on April 13, 1909, in Jackson, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty, an Ohio native, and the former Chestina Andrews, who had been a West Virginia schoolteacher. The Weltys settled in Jackson shortly after their marriage, and Mr. Welty became an executive of the Lamar Life Insurance company. They also had two sons younger than Miss Welty.         The Weltys were devoted to books and learning. In ''One Writer's Beginnings,'' Miss Welty's 1984 memoir based on a series of lectures she gave at Harvard, she recalled the exhilaration she felt when she fell under the spell of books.         ''It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that storybooks had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass,'' she wrote. ''Yet regardless of where they came from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''         Miss Welty was a daily visitor to the local Andrew Carnegie Library, where she was allowed what she later called ''a sweet devouring'' -- a ration of two books a day by the stern-faced librarian. Several decades later, in 1986, the building was replaced; the new one was named the Eudora Welty Library.         Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.         ''It took Latin to thrust me into a bona fide alliance with words in their true meaning,'' she wrote. ''Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence. I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''         'Listening for Stories'         Miss Welty said she discovered stories in daily life. ''Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories,'' she wrote in 1984. ''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''         Miss Welty attended the Mississippi State College for Women, where she helped to start a literary magazine, and then the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1929. After college Miss Welty told her parents that she wanted to be a writer, but she said that her father insisted that she ''learn something to fall back on'' to support herself, so she took advertising courses at the Columbia University School of Business.         Back in Jackson in the early 1930's, Miss Welty wrote for a radio station and contributed society items to The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. During the Depression she got a publicity job at the Works Progress Administration, which enabled her to travel throughout Mississippi. She was troubled and fascinated by the people she saw and took hundreds of snapshots with a cheap camera, developing her prints in her kitchen at night. In 1971 Random House published a collection of these pictures, ''One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression.'' The book's stark, often grim black-and-white photographs revealed that Miss Welty's long-admired sense of observation was not limited to the ear.         ''I learned quickly enough when to click the shutter,'' she said later, ''but what I was becoming aware of more slowly was a story-writer's truth. The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it. In my own case, a fuller awareness of what I needed to find out about people and their lives had to be sought for through another way, through writing stories. I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''         The Depression pictures were exhibited in New York in 1936, the same year that Miss Welty, who had sent dozens of unsolicited stories to magazines, finally made her first sale. A small literary magazine called Manuscript accepted ''Death of a Traveling Salesman,'' the often anthologized recounting of the last day in the life of a lonely, ill and frightened shoe salesman who loses his way in rural Mississippi. Before he dies of a heart attack, he realizes fleetingly how little he has understood about himself and others.         It was the first of several stories published in small magazines. ''None of these publications paid, not really,'' Miss Welty recalled years later. ''Oh, I think The Southern Review was giving $25 a story, but it took two years before an agent could place one of my stories in a national magazine.''         Life at the P.O.         Miss Welty began to attract attention after The Atlantic Monthly published two of her stories destined to become classics: ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' and ''A Worn Path.'' The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office. The second won Miss Welty her first of six O. Henry Awards.         Early admirers of her short stories pressed Miss Welty to try her hand at a novel, but she resisted for several years. Her first hardcover book was a 1941 short-story collection, ''A Curtain of Green,'' with an introduction by Katherine Anne Porter, who had encouraged her early on. ''A Curtain of Green '' sold only 7,000 copies in 30 years, but the 17 stories in the collection became widely known and valued through their inclusion in many anthologies and college textbooks.         The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.' to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''         ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' combined Miss Welty's antic sense of humor with her pleasure in language. As the narrator prepares to leave her family's home, she says: ''So I hope to tell you I marched in and got the radio. And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot . . . The thermometer and the Hawaiian ukulele were certainly mine, and I stood on the stepladder and got all my watermelon-rind preserves and every fruit and vegetable I put up, every jar.''         An Internet Legacy         Many years later Eudora, the widely used e-mail program, was named after Miss Welty because its designer, Steven Dorner, said he had been processing so much e-mail that he felt like the Welty character who lived at the post office.         In 1941 Miss Welty followed ''A Curtain of Green'' with ''The Wide Net and Other Stories,'' and in 1942 she published ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' a novella that later became a successful musical in an adaptation by Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman. Her first full-length novel, ''Delta Wedding,'' appeared in 1946.         Three years later, a group of stories set in Morgana, an imaginary small town on the Mississippi Delta, was published under the title ''The Golden Apples.'' All of Miss Welty's gifts for compression, metaphorical language and poetic structure were on display. So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart. In the story ''The Whole World Knows,'' she charted a doomed meeting between a young couple who were estranged:         ''There in the flower beds walked the same robins. The sprinkler dripped now. Once again we went into the house by the back door. Our hands touched. We had stepped on Tellie's patch of mint. The yellow cat was waiting to go in with us, the door handle was as hot as the hand, and on the step, getting under the feet of two people who went in together, the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water -- ''Watch out for Mama's!'' -- a thousand times we had gone in like that. As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''         During World War II, Miss Welty was briefly on the staff of The New York Times Book Review and sometimes contributed reviews under the pseudonym Michael Ravenna. But she returned to Jackson during the 1950's, when her mother and brothers fell seriously ill. For almost 15 years, from the mid-50's to the late 60's, she published just a few short stories, some book reviews and a children's book, ''The Shoe Bird'' (1964). During this period she cared for her family and worked on two novels. Some writers speculated that she also suffered some spiritual ordeal or artistic crisis. After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''         Miss Welty's stories often reflected the fruits of her wide reading and special interests. ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.         In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.         Fiction of Family Life         That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life. They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.         Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders. Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she  demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager. This novel was adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and became a hit when it opened on Broadway in 1956.         Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place. We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way. We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations. We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''         And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?' ''         ''I didn't need their pointers to know that there was injustice among human beings or that there was trouble,'' she continued. ''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this. I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else. Whatever else makes them up interests me.''         Miss Welty made one notable exception to her rule against direct crusading when Medgar Evers, the black civil rights leader, was shot to death by a sniper in Jackson in 1963.         ''I did write a story the night it happened,'' she said. ''I was so upset about this, and I thought: I live down here where this happened and I believe I must know what a person like that felt like -- the murderer. There had been so many stories about such a character in the stock manner, written by people who didn't know the South, so I wrote about the murderer intimately -- in the first person, which was a very daring thing for me to do.''         In the Mind of an Assassin         The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested. Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath. Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.         Miss Welty never married. (Marriage, she said, ''never came up.'') She leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she was a shy person, she had many friends who were writers, among them Porter, Robert Penn Warren, Elizabeth Bowen, V. S. Pritchett, Cleanth Brooks, Shelby Foote, Walker Percy, Elizabeth Spencer, Ross MacDonald and Reynolds Price. She also had an enduring friendship with Diarmuid Russell, the agent who fiercely and devotedly represented her.         Her friends often spoke of her innate courtesy, which led her to seldom turn down requests for interviews. Those conversations usually took place at her home, and she often offered her interviewer bourbon and a home-cooked meal. She was warm and humorously self-deprecating.         One unlikely caller was Henry Miller. Miss Welty's mother, who had heard that Miller was a writer of obscene books, banned him from  their house. When Miss Welty did see him, she reported that he was ''the dullest man I ever saw in my life.''         ''He wasn't interested in anything outside himself,'' she said, ''that was the truth.''         In 1943, Faulkner wrote an unsolicited letter to Miss Welty after he had by chance read ''The Robber Bridegroom.''         ''You're doing all right,'' he said. That letter was hung near her wooden desk in an upstairs room in the Tudor-style house that her father built on Pinehurst Street in 1925, when she was 16.         ''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said. ''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''         Correction:  July 25, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the author Eudora Welty yesterday misstated the number of O. Henry Awards she received for short stories and misidentified the first of her stories to win one. The total was eight, not six. The first was for ''Petrified Man'' (1939); ''A Worn Path'' won in 1941.       
         Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ''Ding Dong School'' in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93.         Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ''How are you today?'' She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style.         Then, ''Miss Frances'' would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons:         ''Ask your mother where to play with it,'' for a homemade musical instrument.         ''Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,'' for a messier project.         The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material.         ''Ding Dong School'' began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959.         ''Ding Dong School,'' directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian.         Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ''actually taught kids things,'' Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ''high-tech, dazzly stuff'' of today, ''it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,'' he said.         ''The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,'' he said. ''The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching.''         Its daily competitors at the time were ''Captain Kangaroo'' on CBS and ''Mickey Mouse Theater'' on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ''Ding Dong School'' appeared: ''Sesame Street'' and ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''         In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953.         ''She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,'' The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ''She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers.''         When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ''heartbreaking.''         ''The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,'' he wrote.         In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be.         ''I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,'' she said in a 1955 interview. ''It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,'' she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown.         She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it.         What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ''new doors and windows'' of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said.         Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942.         In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children.         For more than two decades before first ringing the ''Ding Dong'' bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago.         But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II.         ''Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,'' she said.       
         Fanny Brennan, an American painter of small, meticulously executed surrealist still lifes, who spent her childhood in the legendary circle of artists and writers gathered around Sara and Gerald Murphy in Paris, died on July 22 at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 80.         Ms. Brennan was born in 1921 in Paris, where her parents, Richard and Alice Lee Myers, were well-known figures in the city's expatriate art community. The Murphys were close family friends. Educated in Europe and the United States, she enrolled in art school in Paris in 1938, met Tristan Tzara, had her portrait drawn by Giacometti and taught Picasso how to play Chinese checkers at the Cafe Flore.         When war broke out, she left for New York, where she worked for Harpers Bazaar and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1944, she was hired by the Office of War Information to work in Europe. She married the chief of its graphics and exhibitions division, Francis Brennan, in 1946.         Even as a student, Ms. Brennan worked on an unusually small scale. Most of her paintings were three or four inches in diameter. As a young artist in Manhattan, she found that the bathroom of her apartment was the ideal size for a studio. She stopped painting nearly 20 years after her children were born, but began again in 1970 with playful, ingeniously composed images, which often combined domestic objects -- needles, buttons, books -- with panoramic landscapes.         In 1941, she was included in two shows at the Wakefield Bookshop gallery in Manhattan, run by Betty Parsons. Beginning in 1973, she had three solo exhibitions with Parsons, then several with Coe Kerr Gallery. Her work is represented by Salander-O'Reilly Gallery. In 1990, a book of her work, ''Skyshades,'' appeared with an introduction by Calvin Tomkins.         Ms. Brennan is survived by two sons, Richard Lee Brennan of Manhattan and Christopher Herrick Brennan of Feasterville, Pa., and a sister, Lee M. Wrenn of Orcas Island, Wash.       
         Margaret Kilgallen, an artist who contributed to the vibrant fusion of graffiti art, folk art, painting and installation art that emerged in San Francisco in the 1990's, died Thursday in San Francisco. She was 33.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Kilgallen was born in Washington and raised in Kensington, Md. She received a B.A. in studio art and printmaking at Colorado College before moving to San Francisco. Exposed to bluegrass music as a child, Ms. Kilgallen was a skillful banjo player. In San Francisco she took up surfing, becoming equally adept. In 1990 she met her future husband, Barry McGee, also a surfer, and one of several young painters showing in galleries and painting noncommissioned murals on city walls. She and Mr. McGee, who were married in 1999, became part of a circle that included the artists Chris Johanson, Phil Frost, Ed Templeton and Thomas Campbell.         Ms. Kilgallen eventually painted hundreds of murals around San Francisco, most of which have been painted over.         Until 1997, she worked as a book conservator in the San Francisco Public Library, a job that enabled her to study traditional type fonts, which became central to her work. Her installations featured words and cartoonish figures, usually women, painted in different scales on pieces of wood that resembled shop signs, or directly on walls on top of expanses of odd, Depression-conjuring colors. (Consistent with her use of wood scrap for her signs, Ms. Kilgallen got her paint free from recycling centers, which mixed surplus colors at random.)         The overall result was impure Americana, a slightly acidic nostalgia that evoked sideshows, tramp art and old travel posters with infusions of feminist wit. Her women smoked, fought, surfed, played the banjo and occasionally hooked up with men.         Ms. Kilgallen had her first solo exhibition at the Drawing Room at the Drawing Center in New York 1997, and her second the following year at the John Berggruen Gallery in San Francisco. She had a second show in New York at Deitch Projects in SoHo in 1999. Titled ''To Friend and Foe,'' it featured floor-to-ceiling images and words and a pair of small, scrappy wood shacks painted with her signature Victorian lettering.         Ms. Kilgallen's work is currently in ''East Meets West,'' an exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia through July 29, and at Stanford University, where she received a master's degree on June 17.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Asha, who was born on June 7; her parents, Dena and James Kilgallen, of Rockville, Md.; two sisters, Lil Kilgallen of Adamstown, Md., and Marianne Sullivan of Marriottsville, Md.; and a brother, Jamie Kilgallen of Charleston, N.C.       
         Dr. Ruth Ann Sanger, a blood researcher and a co-author of a blood-group manual that helped make transfusions safer, died on June 4 in Britain. She was 82.         Dr. Sanger was an internationally known expert in blood grouping, having worked for many years at the Medical Research Council in London.  In 1950, she published, with Dr. Robert Russell Race, ''Blood Groups in Man,'' a reference book for nearly 30 years. The sixth and final edition came out in 1975.         She also contributed papers to medical and genetics journals.         Dr. Sanger was born in Australia. She graduated from the University of Sydney in 1938 and joined the staff of the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service there. She received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1948, two years after she went to work as a researcher in the blood group unit of the Medical Research Council.         The unit had an important part in defining blood groups and their complexity. Dr. Sanger collaborated with its director, Dr. Race, on ''Blood Groups in Man,'' which became known as ''Race and Sanger'' and something of a bible for transfusion specialists.         She was a member of the International Society of Blood Transfusion and an affiliate of similar groups in Canada, Germany, Mexico and Norway.         Drs. Sanger and Race married in 1956. She succeeded him as director of the blood group unit in 1973 and retired 10 years later. Dr. Race died in 1984. They had no children.       
         Jeanne Loriod, whose artistry playing the ondes martenot, a rare electronic instrument known for its haunting wail, made her the instrument's most celebrated performer, died on Aug. 3 at Juan-les-Pins, France. She was 72.         The cause was a stroke, British newspapers reported.         The instrument, also known as ondes musicales, French for musical waves, was first demonstrated in France on April 20, 1928, by its inventor, Maurice Martenot. Miss Loriod was born in Houilles, near Paris, three months later, on July 13.         She followed her sister Yvonne, to the piano class of Lazare Levy at the Paris Conservatory, where she soon became fascinated by the new instrument. She studied it with Martenot, who had just begun teaching it at the conservatory. Her high grades enabled her to join a quartet begun by Martenot's sister, Ginette.         She was in the middle of a futuristic electric music movement that never went remotely as far as its pioneers dreamed. Beginning with the 200-ton telharmonium, and on through at least a dozen instruments with strange-sounding names and even stranger sounds, proponents of the new wired music delighted in making previously unimaginable noises.         For example, the theremin, an electronic instrument conjured up by a Russian scientist, Leon Theremin, as he tinkered with radio parts in 1920, can make a sound that has been likened to a violin being played while submerged in deep water. Other electronic instruments include the trautonium, the sfaerofon, the gnome and the orgatron.         Not surprisingly, the new instruments found their most welcome home in movie soundtracks, including those for ''King Kong,'' ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''Spellbound.'' Rock groups also liked the eerie sounds. The Beach Boys used a theremin in ''Good Vibrations.''         But those who loved the ondes martenot had higher aspirations. It uses oscillating radio tubes to produce electronic pulses at two supersonic sound-wave frequencies. These in turn produce a lower frequency within the audible range that is amplified and converted into sound by a loudspeaker. Many tones can be created by filtering out some of the tones of the audible notes.         The instrument is played with a keyboard and by manipulating a ribbon with a ring for the player's right index finger. Ondes were manufactured individually, to order only.         But like the theremin, the ondes martenot achieved its widest exposure not in avant-garde music, but on the screen. Maurice Jarre, a friend of Ms. Loriod, played the instrument for ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and ''Mad Max.''         One early composer who took an immediate liking to the ondes martenot was Olivier Messiaen, who married Jeanne's sister Yvonne Loriod; she became a renowned pianist. Particularly in his 10-movement symphony, ''Turangalila,'' Messiaen uses the ondes martenot to create shimmering, swooping musical effects. Virtually everywhere ''Turangalila'' was performed, Jeanne Loriod was to be found, her sister often playing the virtuoso piano part. Miss Loriod recorded her part in the symphony at least six times and performed it live on at least four continents with conductors like Pierre Boulez, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and Zubin Mehta.         In addition to Yvonne, Miss Loriod is survived by another sister, Jacqueline.         Miss Loriod also took ample advantage of two further masterworks that Messiaen wrote for the instrument. ''Trois Petites Liturgies de la Présence Divine'' (1943-44) mixes its qualities with women's voices, piano, strings and percussion. ''Saint François d'Assise'' (1975-83) features the ondes in three of the eight tableaus in a work lasting nearly four hours.         Other composers who wrote for the instrument included Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Edgard Varèse, Charles Koechlin, Florent Schmitt and Jacques Ibert.         Jeanne Loriod performed in more than 500 works, 14 of them concertos. She added to the repertoire herself, by creating 85 works for a sextet of ondes she formed in 1974, initially to revive Messiaen's first ondes piece, ''La Fête des Belles Eaux'' of 1937.         She taught at several French conservatories and wrote a three-volume book that became the standard text for the instrument: ''Technique de l'Onde Electronique Type Martenot'' (Leduc, 1987).         Hugh Davies, a performer and musicologist specializing in electronic instruments, estimated that more than 1,000 works had been composed for the ondes.         Thus Miss Loriod bristled when an interviewer suggested to her in 1988 that the instrument's repertory might be less than extensive.         ''Since 1928 we have 15 concertos and over 300 works of chamber music,'' she answered, also citing the 85 she wrote for her sextet.         But the success of the exotic electronic instrument seems to have been diminished by small number of players.         ''The fact is that any instrument with no institutional grounding of second- and third-raters, no spectral army of amateurs, will wither and vanish: how can it not?'' Mark Singer wrote in ''The Wire'' in 1997.         He continued, ''Specialist virtuosos may arrive to tackle the one-off novelty -- the theramin's Clara Rockwell, the ondes martenot's Jeanne Loriod, the trautonium's Oskar Sala -- but there's no meaningful level of entry at the ground floor, and, what's worse, no fallback possibility of rank careerism if things don't turn out.''         Not just anybody, after all, had Ms. Loriod's versatility. Shortly before her death, she had hoped to perform with the British pop group Radiohead. ''Sadly,'' The Times of London said, ''a new era in the history of the 20th century's weirdest classical instrument was not to commence.''         Correction:  August 22, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Jeanne Loriod, a player of the rare electronic instrument known as the ondes martinot, used an erroneous surname for another such musician, a theremin virtuoso, obtained from a discussion of obstacles to their careers in a British online publication, The Wire. She was Clara Rockmore, not Rockwell.       
         Kim Stanley, whose infrequent but luminous stage portraits brought her to the edge of greatness, but who ultimately shrank from the pressures of performance and stardom, died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 76 and lived in Santa Fe.         She died after a prolonged illness, said her daughter Rachel Ryder Zahn.         In plays like William Inge's ''Picnic,'' Horton Foote's ''Traveling Lady'' and, especially, Inge's ''Bus Stop,'' Ms. Stanley captivated Broadway audiences and dazzled the critics in roles that ranged from a gauche young tomboy to a gallant abandoned wife to a well-traveled wisecracking nightclub singer.         She seemed able to take on almost any part and make it come convincingly alive. In the 1955 ''Bus Stop,'' she played Cherie, a worn-at-the-edges nightclub singer -- she calls herself a chanteuse -- who finds herself sitting out a snowstorm in a Kansas diner with her fellow bus passengers, one of whom is a swaggering cowboy. Their sparring not only won laughs, but also touched the heart.         Ms. Stanley, who later admitted to being tone deaf, even managed a deftly comic rendition of ''That Old Black Magic.'' Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, summed up her work as superb and called it a ''glowing performance that is full of amusing detail -- cheap, ignorant, bewildered, but also radiant with personality.''         Ms. Stanley had already won accolades two years earlier as the hoydenish teenager Millie Owens in ''Picnic.'' Then, cast as Georgette Thomas, a young mother whose husband has deserted her in Mr. Foote's 1954 drama ''The Traveling Lady,'' Ms. Stanley so dominated the stage that she was given star billing two days after the play's premiere.         There were more good reviews for her stage work in the years that followed. She appeared in ''A Clearing in the Woods,'' ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Cheri,'' ''A Far Country'' and ''The Three Sisters,'' among other plays, but nothing came close to her success in ''Bus Stop'' except her performance in the 1958 film ''The Goddess,'' one of her rare forays into Hollywood.         In that film Ms. Stanley won praise as a glamorous actress whose life is emotionally barren, managing to project glamour even though she was quick to concede she was no celluloid siren. She soon decided she did not much like acting for the cameras. The fragmented nature of movie making frustrated her. It was, she said, like ''shooting pool in the dark.''         Kim Stanley, whose original name was Patricia Reid, was born on Feb. 11, 1925, in Tularosa, N.M. Her parents were divorced when she was a young girl, and she and her three brothers were raised by her mother, an interior decorator who moved the family from New Mexico to Texas. Often lonely as a child, she wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming an artist or, at the very least, the local May Queen. She acted in school plays, attended the University of New Mexico and eventually graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Texas.         Her acting experiences in school had kindled a spark, she later said, but she was still thinking of pursuing a graduate degree and perhaps a career in medicine. Then she was approached by a director of the Pasadena Playhouse, who by chance had seen her perform in a college production and offered her a scholarship. She stayed at the California theater only a year, but it was enough to change the course of her life. The compass pointed toward Broadway.         After a season of walk-ons with a stock company in Louisville, Ky., where she'd gone at the urging of a friend who was working there, she boarded a Greyhound bus for New York. After a few fruitless months of making the rounds, talking to agents and trying to see producers, she turned to modeling dresses and then worked as a waitress at a hotel. She also went through a brief marriage to another aspiring actor, Bruce Hall.         The Off Broadway theater was in its infancy, but Ms. Stanley (she had taken her maternal grandmother's maiden name some years before) took an unpaid job with a Greenwich Village group called the Interplayers and lived off the money she had earned as a model. She met other promising newcomers, among them Gene Saks, Sidney Lumet and Michael V. Gazzo (later to write ''A Hatful of Rain'') and soon found herself in a new group called Off Broadway Inc.         She joined the Actors Studio, where she met and worked with the Studio's guru, Lee Strasberg, and later described him as the person ''who made it possible for the whole world to open up for me.'' Method acting, she said, was the key to becoming ''as free as possible.''         In 1949 she put her training to work at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, acting opposite Anthony Franciosa in Gertrude Stein's ''Yes Is for a Very Young Man,'' a production that drew good reviews and calls from theatrical agents. More good notices followed her next appearance, as St. Joan at the Equity Library Theater, and when the producer Kermit Bloomgarden called to invite her to replace Julie Harris in Lillian Hellman's ''Montserrat,'' she made the leap to Broadway.         Ms. Stanley married for the second time in 1949, to another actor, Curt Conway, with whom she had a son, Jamison, and a daughter, Lisa, and soon found herself torn between the conflicting demands of family and career. Performance pressures also began to take their toll, and even after her shining success in ''Bus Stop,'' stories began to circulate about her profound malaise each night at curtain time. By 1957 she had been though another divorce and remarriage, this time to the actor and director Alfred Ryder, by whom she had another daughter, Rachel. Her children survive her, along with a brother, Justin, and three grandchildren.         By the end of the 50's there were other signs of trouble. In 1958 she appeared with Helen Hayes and the British actor Eric Portman in ''A Touch of the Poet'' by Eugene O'Neill. Atkinson hailed Ms. Stanley and Ms. Hayes as ''the two finest actresses of their respective generations.'' Nevertheless, after opening night Ms. Stanley missed a number of performances. It was no secret by then that she and Portman were not on speaking terms, and it was no great surprise when Ms. Stanley abruptly left the play, blaming Portman for slapping her in one scene with what she said was excessive enthusiasm. Portman in turn declared, ''I don't go bashing people in the face,'' but Ms. Stanley was gone for good.         Such conflicts aside, she was still working at perfecting her art. ''To keep it fresh, I try to begin all over again in each performance,'' she told an interviewer. In 1959 she played a middle-aged woman in love with a handsome 19-year-old (Horst Buchholz) in ''Cherie,'' adapted by Anita Loos from two novels by Colette and set in France in the years just before and after World War I. Atkinson found her performance ''magnetic and illuminating.'' Two years later, in Henry Denker's semi-documentary 1961 play ''A Far Country,'' directed by her husband, Alfred Ryder, Ms. Stanley won praise as a young woman afflicted by hysterical paralysis who is helped by the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.         In 1964 Ms. Stanley returned to the source of her first inspiration as an actress and appeared as Masha in an  Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' directed by her old mentor, Lee Strasberg, and co-starring Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight. It was to be Ms. Stanley's last appearance on the New York stage.         The same year, in the British film thriller ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' her portrayal of a sinister London medium who, with her compliant husband (Richard Attenborough), schemes to kidnap a child, won her rave reviews and an Oscar nomination as best actress. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther described Ms. Stanley's portrait of the woman as ''a humble, cloying shrew -- an insidiously diabolic creature, and yet a pitiful victim.'' She did not win an Oscar, although the New York Film Critics gave her their best actress award. Moviegoers were not to see her again for 18 years.         In little more than a decade she had established herself as one of Broadway's most brilliant actresses although, oddly, she never won a Tony Award. She had a number of television appearances to her credit, appearing in various dramatic series and winning an Emmy in 1963 for her work in a ''Ben Casey'' episode about mercy killing. But there were only the two Hollywood films, ''The Goddess'' and ''Seance.'' And for a long while that was the sum of her career: brilliant but all too brief. She returned to her native New Mexico, put aside the stresses of performing, did some teaching in Santa Fe and nursed her ambition to have her own ensemble of actors.         By 1979, however, she was back in New York as artistic director of a troupe of actors in a small theater in SoHo. ''I want to be involved with the great plays,'' she told an interviewer, and admitted that she missed acting and intended to act again. For one thing, she said, ''before I get too old, I'd like to do Hedda Gabler,'' and, she added, she wanted to make ''a serious film about Virginia Woolf.''         As it turned out, she did neither, but she did return to films in 1982 in ''Frances,'' in which she played the ambitious, devouring mother of the actress Frances Farmer (Jessica Lange). Her performance brought her a second Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. The next year, she had a small part as a barnstorming pilot in ''The Right Stuff.'' And she returned to television in 1984, winning her second Emmy in the role of Big Mama in a PBS production of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' with Ms. Lange and Tommy Lee Jones.         There the story ended. Ms. Stanley spent her last years quietly, back in New Mexico. ''You can't be good in the theater unless you've immersed yourself in the marvelous detective story of the human spirit,'' she once told an interviewer. ''But it's difficult, terribly difficult.''         In her case the mystery remained unsolved. She had, in effect, achieved her childhood dream of becoming the May Queen, but chose to leave the parade before its end.         Correction:  August 27, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the actress Kim Stanley on Tuesday misstated the surname of her son and misidentified his father. The son changed his name to Jamison Clift from Conway in the 1980's. His father was William Brooks Clift Jr., not Ms. Stanley's second husband, Curt Conway.         The obituary also omitted a film credit for Ms. Stanley. The Actors Studio production of ''The Three Sisters'' in which she played Masha was videotaped in 1965 and transferred to film and released in 1977.       
         Diana Golden Brosnihan, who lost a leg to cancer at 12, won a gold medal in disabled skiing at the 1988 Calgary Olympics and played a key role in public appreciation of disabled athletes, died Saturday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. She was 38.         Her cancer returned in 1992 and again in 1997.         ''I like to live each day like an adventure,'' she once said.         She did that so well that Sports Illustrated once wrote that she was ''most likely to be remembered as the woman who, perhaps more than any other athlete, brought crossover credibility to the disabled sports movement.''         She was inducted into the Women's Sports Foundation International Hall of Fame in 1997. The citation read, ''She persuaded the ski world to treat all athletes the same, regardless of ability or, in her case, disability.'' She was also inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame that year.         Brosnihan, who grew up in Lincoln, Mass., outside Boston, learned to ski at 5. At 12, she developed bone cancer in her right leg, resulting in amputation above the knee. When she awakened after surgery, her first words were, ''Will I still be able to ski?'' Six months later, she was skiing.         As a high school sophomore, she discovered that she could jog on crutches. In her junior year, the high school ski coach asked her to join the team. She did, and a year later she won the downhill in the world handicapped championships.         ''If you had ever told me that I would make being an athlete my profession, I would have laughed at you, and my family would have laughed at you,'' she once said. ''It was not even a dream.'' But it became a reality. It also became an albatross, and from 1982 to 1985, she took two and a half years off from skiing.         ''It gave me time to find my identity apart from my skiing so that when I came back to skiing it was something I wanted to do for me and not because I needed that image from other people,'' she said.         She used one ski and two outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips attached). Later, never using an artificial leg, she abandoned the outriggers in favor of regular ski poles so she could go faster.         She rejoined the national disabled team and persuaded potential corporate sponsors to support the team as they would any other. She persuaded the United States Ski Association to allow disabled skiers to compete in national championships against able-bodied skiers.         That open-competition policy became known as the Golden Rule, and she took advantage of it. She might finish last, 20 seconds behind a renowned skier like Tamara McKinney, but said she would come closer next time. She often did.         Against other disabled skiers, her success was overwhelming. From 1986 to 1990, she won 10 world and 19 United States championships. In the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, when disabled skiing was a demonstration sport, she won the gold medal in the giant slalom. The United States Olympic Committee voted her the female skier of the year, ahead of able-bodied skiers.         In 1991, the Women's Sports Foundation gave her the Flo Hyman award, which had previously gone to Martina Navratilova, Evelyn Ashford, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Chris Evert.         That year, she retired (for the last time) from competition and took up rock climbing and mountaineering. Then the cancer returned, leading to bilateral mastectomies, the loss of her uterus and an attempted suicide. Again, she turned herself around, climbed Mount Rainier and continued as a motivational speaker.         In 1997, the cancer returned again and spread to her spine, pelvis and lungs. She stopped giving motivational speeches, saying she could not be upbeat anymore and could not force a smile.         At Dartmouth, where she received a degree in English literature in 1984, she casually met Steve Brosnihan, who became a freelance cartoonist for New England newspapers. They met again in 1996 and were married in August 1997 between her chemotherapy sessions.         She is survived by her husband, of Bristol, R.I., her mother, a brother and a sister.         To the end, Brosnihan fought for dignified treatment and perceptions of the disabled. ''You think about women,'' she said, ''and people used to pat us on the back and say: 'Isn't that sweet? She's competing.' Now they don't do that anymore. It's the same with the disabled. People treat us with dignity.         ''To me it has to do with the dignity of each person. Each person is worthy of respect, so it's a matter of if I choose to live with that dignity myself.         ''Sometimes, stereotypes make me laugh. Like when people introduce you as courageous. Often, I've heard it on television, 'We're talking with a girl today who had cancer when she was 12, beat the odds and now she skis.' I say: 'Now wait a minute. I don't just ski. I'm the best in the world and I train my heart and soul out for this and I ski 150 days and I work out in the weight room, and to me courageous doesn't imply any of that.'         ''Athletes don't want to be courageous. They want to be good.''         In 1988, she skied on screen for three minutes in a feature-length movie, ''Escape to Ski.'' Warren Miller, who made the film, became an instant fan.         ''After you're with her for a few minutes, you totally forget her handicap,'' he said. ''She has her act together, and it's not an act.''       
         Jane Greer, whose dolorous but luminous dark eyes and world-weary beauty made her the ideal femme fatale opposite Robert Mitchum in ''Out of the Past'' and ''The Big Steal,'' film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday in Los Angeles.  She was 76.         The cause was complications of cancer, her son Alex Lasker said.  When ''Out of the Past'' was remade 37 years later as ''Against All Odds,'' she came out of semi-retirement to play the mother of the character she had originally played in 1947.         She was never a big star, at least not by the standards of her day, and she was mostly relegated to melodramas. But when a later generation of movie buffs became attracted to Hollywood's black-and-white twisty yarns of the 1940's, they were quite taken by Miss Greer, whose face was best viewed through cigarette smoke in a bar.         In ''Out of the Past,'' she appears with both Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, who plays the heavy, Mitchum's former employer. Mitchum is trying to forget about his shabby past but is recruited by his old boss and ordered to Mexico to find Miss Greer.         The movie's crosses and double- crosses were nowhere nearly as opaque as those of ''The Maltese Falcon,'' but when Bosley Crowther reviewed it for The New York Times, he wrote that its 97 minutes of back stabbing and double-dealing were such that they had to be ''reckoned by logarithmic tables.''         Bettejane Greer was born on Sept. 9, 1924, in Washington. She started her show business career as a big band singer. During World War II, when she was about 19, her mother, who worked for the War Department, saw to it that Jane was one of three young women selected to model uniforms for the new Women's Army Corps.         Howard Hughes, the movie maker with a legendary affinity for beautiful women, saw her photograph and signed her to a personal contract. He made it clear that he didn't want her to marry anyone.         ''I found him rather endearing, like a child,''Miss Greer said of Hughes in one interview. ''His idea was to go to the amusement park,'' she said, adding, ''He won a large collection of Kewpie dolls for me.''         The photograph of Miss Greer in a WAC uniform was published in Life magazine, where it attracted the attention of Rudy Vallee, the crooner.  He called Life and tried unsuccessfully to get her address.         He found it anyhow, and proposed after a whirlwind courtship. Miss Greer accepted. The marriage lasted from 1943 to 1945. Miss Greer dropped the ''Bette'' from her name, and since she didn't think that Mr. Hughes had been using her to her best advantage at R.K.O., bought back her contract for $7,572, payable at $25 a week. When she was almost paid up, she asked Mr. Hughes to forgive the last $50. He refused.         She married Edward Lasker in 1947, the same year she made ''Out of the Past'' and ''They Won't Believe Me,'' with Robert Young and Susan Hayward; they were later divorced.         Among her other movies were ''I Married a Communist'' (1949) with Paul Lukas and Robert Ryan; ''Somebody Loves Me'' (1952), ''Down Among the Sheltering Palms'' (1952) and ''Run for the Sun'' (1956) with Richard Widmark and Trevor Howard, all made at MGM.         In 1957, she also appeared with James Cagney in ''Man of a Thousand Faces,'' the story of Lon Chaney, the silent star. After ''Billie,'' which she made in 1965 with Patty Duke and Jim Backus, she made few movies.         In addition to her son Alex, she is survived by two other sons, Lawrence and Steve; a twin brother, Don, and two grandchildren. Her companion, Frank London, an acting coach, died in January.         Years later, when one of her sons told her that she was ''Queen of Film Noir,'' she told him she really didn't know what film noir was.       
         THERE is no saying no to Caroline H. Newhouse. But you wouldn't know it upon meeting the matriarch of the Newhouse  family in the formal sitting room of her Park Avenue apartment. She sits on a plush sofa, a well-coiffed little woman of 91, ever so sweet, so demure.         But don't let her fool you. This is one tough lady.         Just ask the many wealthy relatives whom she has ordered to fan out into the philanthropic world, assigning them to various boards and charities, even making her pitch at the family Thanksgiving dinner. (She waits until cocktails are over.)         Mrs. Newhouse is an aunt of  S. I. Newhouse Jr., the multibillionaire chairman of Condé Nast Publications. She is the widow of Theodore Newhouse, one of three brothers who founded one of the nation's biggest communications conglomerates. She has become the grande dame of charities in her family.         There was that time when Mrs. Newhouse, as an original board member of the New York City Opera, informed sorrowful board members that she planned on retiring, but she told them, rather drily, not to worry. She'd find them another Newhouse. She called up her nephew Mark Newhouse, who later became the opera board's president.         ''She didn't really offer it,'' the nephew says.  ''She pretty much told me.''         Mrs. Newhouse also put the bite on her niece  Caroline Diamond Harrison, noting pointedly that Mrs. Harrison's sister Alison Diamond Levasseur is on the junior committee of the New York City Opera, and that she too should have something to do. Mrs. Newhouse nabbed her niece for her pet charity, Career Transition for Dancers, a nonprofit group that finds new skills for retiring dancers.         ''There's no denying it,'' Mrs. Harrison says. ''She always comes out with things going the way she wants them to go.''         But in Mrs. Newhouse's apartment, her steely determination is not immediately apparent. She is a bit nervous, extending her hand in a sitting room surrounded by bronze sculptures of her own creation and artwork that includes a Renoir here, a little Rubens over there. Dressed in a salmon-colored pantsuit, she makes small talk about the weather, her failing eyesight. Her fingers drip with serious diamonds, and large South Sea pearls are draped around her neck. A uniformed servant materializes to offer refreshments.         MRS. NEWHOUSE is not keen to draw attention to herself or her philanthropic efforts. ''I don't like to talk about myself,'' she mutters. But her red-painted lips curl into a sly smile and she chuckles, confirming how she has indeed parceled out charity assignments to family members. ''Oh yes, they always say yes,'' she boasts. ''They all make time when I ask them to do something.''         As she rises to give a tour of her artwork, Mrs. Newhouse moves with fragile steps through the foyer with the marble checkerboard floor and into her small library. She pats the seat beside her on a sofa, coaxing up her gray Persian cat, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with luminescent orange eyes. ''Come, sweetheart, don't be bashful. Come here, Wolfie.''         She speaks with an accent still strong from her native Germany, which she left at 23. She has an Old World modesty, too. It takes her closest friend, Alexander J. Dubé, to loosen her up. Mr. Dubé, the executive director of Career Transition for Dancers, bounds into the room, jiggling coins that he found on the floor. They glance at each other conspiratorially. More money for the organization.         ''Go find some more,'' she says, holding open her palm.         Mrs. Newhouse has been particularly adroit at roping family members into involvement with Career Transition for Dancers, which has served more than 2,000 dancers since it began in 1985.         ''She makes them work,'' says  Mr. Dubé, 62, who met Mrs. Newhouse and her husband 26 years ago. ''She'll call them up and say, 'Why haven't you sold any tables for the gala?' or call them up and say, 'I want you to be my co-chair.' She goes after them, and no one says no to Aunt Caroline.''         Si Newhouse Jr.'s Condé Nast is a major underwriter of the organization's annual fund-raising gala in October. Another nephew, Jonathan Newhouse, and his wife, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, have flown in from London, where they live, to be chairman and chairwoman of the benefits.         Mrs. Newhouse has donated $1 million to establish a permanent home and created a scholarship fund that has given away more than $1 million. She never studied dance herself, but often used dancers as models. She says they taught her much about their short careers, facing retirement on average around 30, or when they are injured. ''They're lost, because when you are a dancer you have no time to do anything else but dance,'' she says.         Mrs. Newhouse retired from sculpturing in her mid-70's. She began studying the arts in Germany. She was one of three children raised by her mother after her father, a military officer, was killed in World War I. She says she inherited her spirit of giving from her mother.         She met her future husband at a New Hampshire resort. When he told her he sold newspapers, she thought he owned a kiosk or hawked newspapers as a street vendor. They married a  year later, in 1956.         Mrs. Newhouse thinks she and the Newhouse family are a good match. ''They are so warm and giving, and they respect me because I am the oldest. I am the matriarch.''         Still, she won't let them off the hook when it comes to her charities.         ''They have never said no to me yet.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Gale Cincotta, a plainspoken mother of six who became a neighborhood activist and went on to help ignite the national debate over bank lending policies that discriminated against minority home buyers, died Wednesday at a hospital in Maywood, Ill. She was 72.         The cause was gall bladder cancer, said Tracy Van Slyke, spokeswoman for the National Training and Information Center, of which Ms. Cincotta was executive director.         Ms. Cincotta, who lived in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, achieved fame for her spirited fights for residents of the neighborhood of Austin, on Chicago's West Side, where she lived most of her life. In a 1996 article in Illinois Issues, she told of nailing a rat to the door of the alderman for  Austin in 1970 after he refused to attack rodents. The next day, the city's rat patrol was on the job.         She moved on to national issues, especially her challenge to the banking industry and the federal bureaucracy over the practice called redlining, refusing to lend to residents of minority neighborhoods. As part of this fight, she once threatened to nail a ''Loan Shark'' sign over the door of the Federal Reserve in Washington.         After redlining was outlawed in the 1970's, she kept fighting to make sure the law was enforced.         Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said she ''was instrumental in helping the city formulate its campaign against predatory lending.''         Last year, she successfully lobbied for a Chicago ordinance to ban such lending practices, like offering very high mortgage rates and other confiscatory financial terms to minority members and the poor, often resulting in the loss of homes through foreclosures. In April, the Illinois Legislature followed suit.         Gail Angeles was born on Dec. 28, 1929, in Chicago. Her father ran a Greek restaurant. She married a gas station owner and they had six sons. She became politically active in the 1960's because of school crowding.         In the late 1960's, Ms. Cincotta became president of the Organization for a Better Austin. The school battle expanded into other concerns, as Ms. Cincotta fought real estate agents' encouragement of panic selling by white homeowners as minorities began looking for homes.         People in other cities began turning to Ms. Cincotta and her colleagues for advice, and she became head of National People's Action, a network of 30 groups from 110 cities. The umbrella group held a housing conference in Chicago in 1972 and a protest in Baltimore the next year.         The strategy was extended to other issues, including consumer protection. ''Coalitions are forming all over the place,'' Ms. Cincotta said in an interview with The New York Times in 1982.         Her group was one of those that successfully pressed Congress to pass the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires lending institutions to disclose where they make home loans. It also was an advocate in the winning fight to persuade Congress to pass the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which required banks to invest in neighborhoods where they did business.         National People's Action combined with other neighborhood groups to persuade three large Chicago banks to commit themselves to making $173 million in low-interest loans for housing and industrial development in poor neighborhoods. In return, the groups agreed not to challenge the banks' merger plans.         Colleagues remembered her war cry: ''We want it. They've got it. Let's go get it.''         Ms. Cincotta is survived by five sons, George and Charles of Delray Beach, Fla.; James of Ottawa, Canada; Theodore of Phoenix and Richard of Oak Park, Ill., eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.  No information was available on the sixth son.       
         Ethel Redner Scull, who with her husband, Robert, achieved fame and social status in the 1960's by building one of the first major collections of Pop and Minimal art and becoming the subject of an Andy Warhol portrait, died on Monday at a retirement home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack followed by a stroke, her son Jonathan said.         Once an ardent partygoer and a devoted fashion buff, Mrs. Scull lived with her husband in an art-filled apartment on upper Fifth Avenue and wore creations by designers like Halston, Adolfo and Yves St. Laurent. But after the Skulls divorced in 1975, she had to curtail her way of life, eventually moving to a small one-bedroom East Side apartment.         Her parting with Scull, a taxi tycoon, after a 30-year marriage, involved her in more than a decade of litigation with him and with his estate; he died in 1986 at 70. One of her major grievances, she said, was that although she had fully participated in their art purchases, her husband tried to take sole credit for them.         After they parted in 1974, she told an interviewer in 1986, she could not get access to 35 paintings he had earlier put in storage when their apartment was being redecorated. And she had ''not enough for a sea urchin to live on,'' she said.         In the litigation she went after what she said was rightly hers: half the paintings, property and money that the couple had acquired. In 1985 a State Supreme Court justice finally awarded her a 35 percent share in Scull's art holdings, including $2.5 million worth of paintings and more than $1 million in cash from paintings sold since 1973.         Both sides met at a warehouse to divide the works in 1986. By the flip of a coin, Mrs. Scull won one of the most important, Jasper Johns's 1959 ''Out the Window.'' Later that year she sold it at auction for $3.63 million, then the highest amount paid for a work by a living artist. Calling its departure devastating, Ms. Scull said, ''I'm losing the Johns because I need money to live on.''         But prolonged physical therapy for a back injury and a penchant for spending, her son said, gradually ate up the money and her alimony. Meanwhile her active social life ground to a halt. ''When you're not giving parties and not having the big shots of the world over, you're not invited,'' she said. ''And if your name is not in the columns, you fade away from the scene.''         Besides Jonathan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Scull is survived by two other sons, Adam, of Miami Beach, and Stephen Paul, of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Kaplan of New York and Florida; and two grandchildren.         Ethel Redner was born in the Bronx in 1921. Her father, Ben Redner, owned a taxicab company, and she led a privileged life. A tall, striking woman with a mane of tawny hair, she met her future husband, when she was 23.         At the time she was studying advertising art at the Parsons School of Design, which she described as ''more of a finishing school then.'' In 1944, after a five-month courtship, she married Scull, who had dropped out of high school during the Depression and had an up-and-down career as a freelance illustrator and industrial designer.         At first the couple lived in a small apartment near the Museum of Modern Art, and Mrs. Scull studied at the Art Students League, where she painted realist canvases.         When her father retired, he gave shares in the business to his three sons-in-law. Within a few years Scull had built up his share into a fleet of 130 cabs with 400 drivers. By that time the couple lived in a house in Great Neck, N.Y., bought for them by Mrs. Scull's father. But the couple were culturally and socially ambitious and soon began looking for a larger theater than suburbia.         At Mrs. Scull's prompting, they found it in Manhattan, where, with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, the art world was beginning to generate glamor and profits. At first the Sculls collected Abstract Expressionists but in the early 1960's discovered a world of newer, younger artists like Warhol, Robert Morris, Mark di Suvero and Larry Poons.         In 1965 they auctioned off part of their Abstract Expressionist collection and used the money to start the Robert and Ethel Scull Foundation for the encouragement of unknown artists. It commissioned environmental works from aspirants like Walter de Maria and Michael Heizer and gave artists stipends, bought them food and clothes and paid for their materials.         Mr. Scull also backed the Green Gallery, a showplace for innovative art founded by Richard Bellamy, for the five years of its existence.         Their patronage established the Sculls, at first considered upstarts in the art world, as big-time players. Giving lavish parties themselves, they soon were celebrities.         Gossip and art writers sought them out, and Mrs. Scull regularly made the fashion pages. In 1963 Warhol did her portrait, ''Ethel Scull 36 Times,'' comprising 36 silk-screen images made from snapshots taken in a Times Square photo booth. The couple was cast in plaster by the sculptor George Segal, with Mrs. Scull wearing a Courrèges dress. They established a base in East Hampton, N.Y., then the art world's summer summit.         But in 1973, when they auctioned 50 works by up-and-coming artists for $2.2 million, at the time a record for contemporary American art, they were castigated by some artists and critics, among them Robert Rauschenberg, because they had acquired the art so cheaply. Mr. Rauschenberg accused the Sculls of infidelity and the auction house of encouraging profiteering.         Later, asked by an interviewer about accusations that he and his wife bought art for investment and for social climbing, Mr. Scull replied: ''It's all true. I'd rather use art to climb than anything else.''       
         Sallie M. Wheeler, an Anheuser-Busch heiress who led a successful campaign to return the nation's oldest and most prestigious horse show to Manhattan, died on Friday at her home in Keswick, Va. She was 70.         Mrs. Wheeler, a lifelong equestrian, led efforts to return the National Horse Show to Madison Square Garden after it moved to the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1989. With its audience full of black ties and evening gowns, the show had been a highlight of the high society calendar. But, facing financial burdens, it began to lose its luster in the 1980's.         The show, a Manhattan mainstay since 1883, relocated to the Meadowlands amid rumors of impending bankruptcy. In New Jersey, the show increased in size and eliminated its debt but began to lose what Mrs. Wheeler saw as its greatest asset: its prestige.         Mrs. Wheeler believed the National Horse Show was synonymous with its original location, Madison Square Garden. Throughout the show's history, and even during its seven years at the Meadowlands, fans referred to the show as simply the Garden. The horse show is among four events that have been held at the four different Madison Square Garden buildings. Mrs. Wheeler contributed her time and fortune to make sure it went back there.         With much fanfare, the show returned to the Garden in 1996. To herald its homecoming, Mrs. Wheeler arranged for Seventh Avenue to be shut for a parade of Budweiser Clydesdales.         The heyday of the show was over, however. What was once a weeklong event was condensed into four days and eventually into two and a half. And its stature in the New York social scene was only partly restored.         Mrs. Wheeler's love of horses stemmed from her childhood. She was born Sallie Marie Busch on Aug. 22, 1931, in St. Louis to Catherine Milliken Busch and Adolphus Busch III, who became president of Anheuser-Busch in 1934.         Mr. Busch and his brother, August A. Busch Jr., were partners at the brewery and were accomplished horsemen. As a child growing up on Grant's Farm, once the home of Ulysses S. Grant, Sallie rode horses, and when her father died in 1946, August Busch helped rear her. She began to ride competitively, and at 15, she made her first National Horse Show appearance.         Supported by her stake in the family company, Sallie made a living of her love of horses. In 1965, she married Kenneth M. Wheeler, a professional horse trainer. During their more than 35 years of marriage, they raised and trained hundreds of champion horses at their farm in Keswick and participated in equestrian shows around the country.         Among the most prominent and successful exhibitors in the horse world, the Wheelers won thousands of blue ribbons, an average of 200 to 300 each year. In 1987, the American Horse Shows Association named Mrs. Wheeler its horsewoman of the year. In 1999, the organization gave the Wheelers its lifetime achievement award.         Upon receiving that award, Mrs. Wheeler said: ''It is rare that two people have so fully enjoyed a career in a profession and a hobby in a sport such as Kenny and I have been privileged to. We both realize that none of this would be possible without the fabulous animals we do dearly love and appreciate.''         Mrs. Wheeler's first marriage, to Robert Motch, ended with his death.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Wheeler is survived by five children, Sallie M. Motch of Cold Spring, N.Y., Robert Motch of Carthage, Mo., Kenneth M. Wheeler Jr. of Memphis, Gordon L. Wheeler of Harrodsburg, Ky., and Douglas B. Wheeler of Keswick, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Pauline Kael, who expressed her passion for movies in jaunty, jazzy prose as the longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died yesterday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 82.         Ms. Kael was probably the most influential film critic of her time. She reviewed movies for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1979, and again, after working briefly in the film industry, from 1980 until 1991. Earlier, she was a film critic for Life magazine in 1965, for McCall's in 1965 and 1966 and for The New Republic in 1966 and 1967.         Enchanting her fans and infuriating her foes, rarely dull and often sharp and funny, with an intellectualism that reflected her background as a student of philosophy, Ms. Kael was never anything but outspoken.         Whether dismissing auteur theory, reviewing Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' (1975) before it was finished, questioning the extent of Orson Welles's contribution to ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) or proclaiming Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' (1973) as a cultural event comparable to the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Ms. Kael was always provocative. Her seductive writing style bred a legion of acolytes, known as Paulettes.         The critic Louis Menand wrote in The New York Review of Books in March 1995: ''Kael was the most brilliantly ad hoc critic of her time, and she made it possible to care about movies without feeling pompous or giddy by showing that what comes first in everyone's experience of a movie isn't the form or the idea but the sensation, and that this is just as true for moviegoers who have been taught to intellectualize their responses to art as it is for everyone else.''         By the time she retired, Mr. Menand observed, she had produced a generation of inferior imitators. ''The manner of appreciation she invented has become the standard manner of popular culture criticism in America,'' he wrote.         Assessing her impact in a 1998 interview, Ms. Kael said: ''I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They've rarely agreed with me about movies.''         At the same time, she deflected the question of whether her criticism had had any effect on films and filmmakers. ''I'd rather not say,'' she answered. ''If I say yes, I'm an egotist, and if I say no, I've wasted my life. Although I've been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy.''         Overpraising or overdamning was Ms. Kael's way, and she left no doubt about her favorites: actors like Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, John Travolta, Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, and actresses like Joan Cusack, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver and Debra Winger.         She championed films of the 1970's, like Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' (1972) and ''Godfather, Part II'' (1974); Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' (1973) and ''Taxi Driver'' (1976); Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo'' (1975); and Mr. Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971) and ''M*A*S*H'' (1970). She also liked the sensual violence of directors like Sam Peckinpah, whose films included ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and ''Straw Dogs'' (1971), and Brian De Palma, whose works include ''Carrie'' (1976) and ''Casualties of War'' (1989).         ''You know, they talk about the golden age of the cinema as if it took place in the late 30's or in the 40's,'' she said in 1989. ''There was nothing personal and exciting in most of those movies. They were machine tooled. They were a lot of fun. But except for Preston Sturges and a few flukey individualists, they just didn't have the personal voice of the movies of the 70's.''         As a writer whose heyday spanned the years from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) to ''Awakenings'' (1990), ''Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ''L.A. Story'' (1991), Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.         In a 1968 review in The New York Times of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,'' a collection of Ms. Kael's reviews and articles, Eliot Fremont-Smith called her ''the most quotable critic writing; but what is important and bracing is that she relates movies to other experiences, to ideas and attitudes, to ambition, books, money, other movies, to politics and the evolving culture, to moods of the audience, to our sense of ourselves -- to what movies do to us, the acute and self-scrutinizing awareness of which is always at the core of her judgment.''         Reviewing ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) in treacle-curdling prose that reportedly prompted McCall's to dismiss her, Ms. Kael asked, ''Wasn't there perhaps one little Von Trapp who didn't want to sing his head off or who screamed that he wouldn't act out little glockenspiel routines for Papa's party guests, or who got nervous and threw up if he had to get out on a stage?''         Writing about Kevin Costner in ''Dances With Wolves'' (1990), she said he had ''feathers in his hair and feathers in his head.'' Writing about Robert De Niro in ''Awakenings,'' she said, ''It's in the quiet moments that he's particularly bad.'' She also said that that film contained ''another of Robin Williams's benevolent-eunuch roles.''         At her peak, she lauded popular movies like Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' (1975) and Philip Kaufman's ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978) and became more of a supporter of the auteur theory. But in time, Ms. Kael, who attracted notice early in her career by attacking critics like Bosley Crowther of The Times and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, came under fire for predictability and dogmatism.         It was inevitable that she should be the object of criticism herself. George Lucas named the villainous General Kael in ''Willow'' (1988) for her, and in a celebrated onslaught in The New York Review of Books in 1980, the writer Renata Adler declared Ms. Kael's work ''piece by piece, line by line, without interruption, worthless.''         Ms. Adler, a former film critic for The Times, wrote that Ms. Kael's recent work ''falls somewhere between huckster copy and ideological pamphleteering,'' and that ''mistaking lack of civility for vitality, she substitutes for argument a protracted, obsessional invective.''         Assessing her own work, Ms. Kael said: ''I try not to be rough on small films. Generally, when I'm really rough, it's on something that I know is going to be a big hit, and that everybody is going to go for it, and I think it's an atrocity -- that's fair game. I'm interested in discovering talent, and in trying to explain why I think someone is talented. I'm more interested in that than I am in panning.''         Over the years, Ms. Kael's reviews and essays were assembled in a series of books whose double-entendre titles suggested the intimacy of her love affair with movies (she preferred the word ''movies'' to ''film'' or ''cinema''). Among them were ''I Lost It at the Movies'' (1965); ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (1968); ''Going Steady'' (1970); ''Deeper Into Movies'' (1973), a 1974 National Book Award winner; ''Reeling'' (1976); ''When the Lights Go Down'' (1980); ''Hooked'' (1989); ''Movie Love'' (1991); and ''For Keeps'' (1994).         When the last was published, she said in the introduction: ''I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have.''         Central to her approach to criticism was her belief that the popular appeal of movies was rooted in trash. In her essay ''Trash, Art and the Movies,'' reprinted in ''Going Steady,'' Ms. Kael wrote: ''Movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip -- from what was coarse and common.''         She went on to say: ''If we've grown up at the movies, we know that good work is not continuous with the academic, respectable tradition but with glimpses of something good in trash, but we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain of discovery. Trash has given us an appetite for art.''         Ms. Kael's appetite for the movies began in childhood. The fifth child and third daughter of immigrants from Poland, Isaac Paul Kael and the former Judith Friedman, she was born in Petaluma, Calif., on June 19, 1919. She described her father as a gentleman farmer and a moviegoer, and her own trips to see films began early.         Among the favorites she recalled were comedies in the late 1920's that starred Bebe Daniels as a wisecracking flapper; ''Million Dollar Legs'' (1932), with W. C. Fields; and the Marx Brothers's ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933).         For a time the Kaels lived on their Sonoma County farm, which they lost in the Depression. Ms. Kael was 8 when her family moved to San Francisco.         ''A bookish girl from a bookish family'' is the way she once described herself. Blue-eyed, brown-haired, five feet tall and weighing a bit more than 100 pounds, she said: ''I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at 'Kentucky Moonshine,' a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to a movie again.''         In 1936 she enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in philosophy. Despite expectations that she would proceed to law school or teaching, she went to New York with a friend, the poet Robert Horan, for about three years.         When she returned to the Bay Area, she led a bohemian life, tried her hand at writing plays and helped make experimental films. Married and divorced three times, she supported herself and her daughter, Gina James, by writing advertising copy, clerking in a bookstore and working as a cook, a seamstress and a textbook writer.         Ms. Kael never wrote movie criticism until she was 35 and, she said, ''I never made a living at this until I was in my 40's.'' Her career at The New Yorker did not begin until she was nearly 50.         The turning point in her life came, as in a Hollywood script, when she was discovered in a coffee shop in the Bay Area in 1953. She was arguing about a movie with a friend when the editor of City Lights magazine asked them each to review Chaplin's ''Limelight.'' The friend turned in nothing. Ms. Kael's review called the film ''slimelight,'' and a career was born.         Soon Ms. Kael was being published in magazines like Sight and Sound and Partisan Review, and her provocative criticism was being broadcast weekly on KPFA, Berkeley's listener-supported radio station. The radio criticism led to an offer to manage an art theater, which she turned into a two-screen house, the Berkeley Cinema Guild Theaters.         ''I made the displays, wrote the program and cleaned the chewing gum off the seats,'' she said. She revived W. C. Fields, Mae West and Busby Berkeley films and Welles's ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) and showed Ingmar Bergman films before they became staples of art houses elsewhere. ''It was exciting turning up things and drawing an audience to see them,'' she said.         The feisty, funny reviews that she wrote for the programs enhanced her reputation, and she began lecturing on film at universities in San Francisco and Los Angeles.         She was 46 when her essays in Partisan Review led to an offer to publish her first book, ''I Lost It at the Movies,'' a collection of her articles and broadcasts, which became a best seller. In it she praised movies like Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (1937), Vittorio de Sica's ''Shoeshine'' (1946) and Martin Ritt's ''Hud'' (1963). She attacked other critics, poked fun at materialistic movie magnates and derided the pretensions of Alain Resnais's ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), calling it ''the snow job in the ice palace.''         Assignments from magazines began to flow in, and in 1965, Ms. Kael, her daughter and Ms. Kael's two basenjis (dogs that, interestingly, cannot bark) moved to New York.         In 1968, in response to an offer from  William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, who was willing to let her write whatever she wanted and at length, Ms. Kael began to review movies for the magazine. Until 1979, she reviewed weekly from September through March, and Penelope Gilliatt reviewed for the other half of the year.         Ms. Kael's first review for The New Yorker was virtually the only rave that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' received in New York, but it compelled other critics to reconsider their assessments.         At 59, Ms. Kael left The New Yorker for Hollywood. She briefly worked as a production executive for Warren Beatty. After that job ended over what were described as ''artistic differences,'' Paramount Pictures put her under contract as a consultant and scout for several months before she returned to The New Yorker in 1980.         Ms. Gilliatt had departed, and Ms. Kael began writing every two weeks, commuting to New York from a Victorian home on four and a half acres in Massachusetts that she bought for $37,000 in 1970. In New York, she stayed in a hotel for four days and saw two movies nightly. Back home at night, she wrote. Her daughter, an artist, lived nearby with her family.         She is survived by her daughter, Ms. James, of Great Barrington, and a grandson, William Friedman, also of Great Barrington, and two sisters, Anne Wallach and Rose Makower, both of Berkeley.         Ms. Kael was reputed never to see a film more than once, yet she seemed to remember everything, from lighting and costumes to writing, sound, direction and performances.         In 1991, at 71, after 22 years at The New Yorker, Ms. Kael retired from regular reviewing.         Looking back on her impassioned love affair with movies, she once said, ''I was a film critic the way somebody might write poetry, for fun or love.''       
         Alice Stewart Trillin -- an educator, film producer and author also known as the muse of her husband, the humorist Calvin Trillin -- died on Tuesday evening at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 63.         The cause of death was heart failure resulting from radiation damage to her heart when she was treated for lung cancer in 1976, her husband said.         She was what Sarah Lyall in a 1994 interview in The New York Times described as ''muse, cheerleader, literary interpreter, straight person and buster of bubbles,'' often appearing as a character in her husband's books. She also became an activist who wrote authoritatively about the life of cancer patients.         Because of her earlier illness, which she said was caused by her parents' heavy smoking during her childhood, she became interested in the relationship of cancer patients and doctors. In 1981 she published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine, ''Of Dragons and Garden Peas: A Cancer Patient Talks to Doctors,'' which is still used in medical schools.         In 1996 she published a book, ''Dear Bruno,'' based on a letter she had sent to a 12-year-old who had cancer. Last January she wrote a much-discussed article for The New Yorker, ''Betting Your Life,'' dealing with the way patients make medical decisions.         Alice Stewart was born on May 8, 1938, in Portchester, N.Y., the only child of Dorothy and James Stewart, a businessman and inventor specializing in the coin changers of vending machines.         She attended public school in Harrison, N.Y.; Wellesley College, where she earned B.A. in 1960, and Yale University, where she earned an M.A. in English in 1961. She taught English at Hofstra University and the City University of New York.         In the mid-1960's, she helped design a pioneering writing curriculum for the Open Admissions Program at City College, and she later became writing program specialist at the City University's instructional resource center. Her interest in curriculum design led consulting work for WNET/Thirteen when the television stations was looking for new approaches to educational programming.         In 1981 she formed Learning Designs, a company that produced award-winning educational television series like ''Behind the Scenes,'' starring the comedians Penn and Teller designed to teach 10-to-12-year-olds about the creative process in the visual and performing arts.         In 1965 she married Mr. Trillin and began to appear as the voice of occasionally deflating reason in his autobiographical writings, particularly his three books about food called ''The Tummy Trilogy'' -- ''American Fried,'' ''Alice, Let's Eat'' and ''Third Helpings'' -- as well as in ''Travels With Alice'' and ''Family Man.''         Ms. Trillin was on the faculty at New York Medical College, and a board member of The Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, which supports camps for children with cancer and blood diseases.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Abigail, of San Francisco, and Sarah, of Los Angeles.       
         Barbara K. Olson, who was killed on Tuesday on the commercial jetliner that was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon, was well known to television viewers across the nation as a combative and confident political commentator representing the conservative Republican point of view.         Mrs. Olson, 45, was also half of a highly influential couple on Washington's social-political scene; her husband, Theodore B. Olson, an appellate lawyer, successfully argued the Florida election case for George W. Bush before the Supreme Court. President Bush named Mr. Olson the nation's solicitor general, the official who formulates the administration's strategy before the nation's courts.         Mr. Olson was in his Justice Department office on Tuesday morning when he received two calls from Mrs. Olson, who was using her cell phone aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to tell him the plane had been hijacked. Her description of what was occurring in her last moments provided what officials said was valuable information about the incident. She reported that the flight crew had been herded to the back of the plane with the passengers, and she asked her husband what she should tell the pilot who was apparently beside her while the hijackers were in control of the cockpit.         Mrs. Olson's friends and her husband said her efforts to ''do something'' on the doomed plane were exquisitely in character. ''She never sat back,'' her husband said in an interview.         The Olsons, who were married four years ago, complemented each other in style. Mrs. Olson was the more outspoken of the two in her televised commentaries, while Mr. Olson presented a more deliberative face in his role as the reigning constitutional litigator for the Republican establishment.         Although Mrs. Olson was generally a take-no-prisoners advocate, Mr. Olson recalled on Tuesday that she recently told him she had come to believe that the national political debate had become too acrimonious. He recalled that she said that during one television appearance, she believed those who called in comments to her and her liberal counterpart, Bill Press, were far too harsh.         Barbara Kay Bracher Olson was born on Dec. 27, 1955, in Houston, and trained to be a teacher at the University of St. Thomas in her hometown. But, she had told friends, she wanted to save enough money to go to law school and decided a quicker way to do so than teaching was to become a part of the film industry.         With no experience in the field but  an abundance of self-confidence, she moved to Hollywood and began telephoning production companies connected to well-known actors, offering herself as an all-around helper. Stacy Keach finally offered her a job, Mr. Olson recalled this week, and when she saved enough money to go to law school, she moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Olson turned down jobs in New York after law school because she yearned to live in Washington. As chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Republican majority from  1995 to 1996, Mrs. Olson led the investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in firing longtime employees of the White House travel office. She became a caustic and relentless critic of the Clintons.         Mrs. Olson wrote ''Hell to Pay'' (Regnery, 1999), a highly critical book about Mrs. Clinton, and recently finished a sequel, ''Final Days,'' about the Clintons' last weeks in the White House. Mr. Olson said it would be published by Regnery.         Mrs. Olson is survived by her brother, David Bracher, and her sister, Antoinette Lawrence, both of Houston, as well as her husband.       
         Berry Berenson Perkins, a photographer and eclectic fashion plate of the 1970's before she settled into marriage with the actor Anthony Perkins, was killed on Tuesday, a passenger on American Airlines Flight 11, which was the first jetliner to strike the World Trade Center, a spokeswoman for the family said. She was 53.         She had been returning to her house in the Hollywood Hills from a family summer home on Cape Cod.         With her sister, Marisa, a widely known model of that era who became an actress, Ms. Perkins captured the attention of fashion editors and society columnists. Her photographs appeared in many magazines, including Glamour and Vogue, whose editor, Diana Vreeland, had known the sisters as girls and nicknamed them Mauretania and Berengaria, after the Cunard ocean liners.         Berinthia Berenson was born in New York, part of a seemingly charmed European family. The daughter of the late Robert L. Berenson, a United States Foreign Service officer, and Gogo Schiaparelli Berenson, Ms. Perkins was a granddaughter of the French couturier Elsa Schiaparelli. On her father's side, she was distantly related to Bernard Berenson, the art critic and collector. Ms. Perkins was educated in Switzerland, France and Italy, traveled widely and was introduced to the famous people in her mother's and grandmother's social world.         She met Mr. Perkins in the early 1970's in New York while he was filming ''Play It As It Lays.'' By happenstance, her apartment was used for a scene in the movie, but she later said she had been in love with the actor since age 12. They were married in 1973, in Wellfleet, Mass., in a ceremony characterized by the informality (the barefoot bride wore a granny dress and carried wildflowers) that seemed to characterize much of their marriage.         In a 1977 interview in The New York Times, conducted while she and Mr. Perkins romped with their young sons, Osgood and Elvis, in their Manhattan home, Ms. Perkins said: ''I'm so delighted with my life. I have this fabulous husband, the man I always wanted to marry. I have two fabulous children, which I always wanted, and we're all so happy.''         Mr. Perkins died in 1992. Ms. Perkins spent the last two years of his life nursing him through AIDS-related illness, which he kept secret because of public paranoia about the disease.         In addition to her sister, of New York, Ms. Perkins is survived by her sons, both of Los Angeles, and her mother, the Marchesa Cacciapuoti di Giugliano, of Paris.         In an interview published in the most recent Fashions of the Times, she characterized herself as something of a peacemaker in a family of strong-willed women.         In recent years, Ms. Perkins spent time in Jamaica, where she ran a beachfront bar with her boyfriend. She also followed the careers of her sons. Osgood is an actor and Elvis an artist. While visiting New York in early July, she told friends she planned to see her sister and mother in Europe and then return to her Cape Cod cottage.       
         Dorothy McGuire, who came to Hollywood from Broadway to repeat her 1941 stage success in the title role in ''Claudia,'' and went on to have a long and distinguished film career playing sensitive, intelligent and steadfast women, died yesterday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 83.         Miss McGuire broke her leg three weeks ago and then developed arrhythmia, said her daughter, Mary Hackett Swope.         Miss McGuire is perhaps best remembered for her portrayal of Katie Nolan, the mother in the 1945 film of Betty Smith's novel ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.'' Dealing with the hardships of tenement life in Williamsburg, the film marked Elia Kazan's directorial debut in Hollywood. It also starred James Dunn, who won an Oscar as best supporting actor for his performance as Miss McGuire's doomed husband; Peggy Ann Garner, who received a special Oscar for her role as their daughter Francie; Joan Blondell; and Lloyd Nolan.         The following year, Miss McGuire gave what Leonard Maltin and other critics called ''an unforgettable performance'' in Robert Siodmak's ''Spiral Staircase,'' playing a mute  servant menaced in a strange household that might be harboring a psychopathic killer.         In 1947 Mr. Kazan summoned her again, this time to play opposite Gregory Peck in Moss Hart's adaption of ''Gentlemen's Agreement,'' Laura Z. Hobson's novel about anti-Semitism. The film earned an Academy Award for best picture, and Mr. Kazan received his first Oscar as best director. Celeste Holm won an Oscar as best supporting actress for the film, and Miss McGuire was nominated for best actress but lost to Loretta Young in ''The Farmer's Daughter.''         Another signature role that showcased Miss McGuire's ability to project simplicity, warmth and forbearance was that of the wife of Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) and the mother of Josh Birdwell (Anthony Perkins) in ''Friendly Persuasion,'' William Wyler's 1956 film about a Quaker family living in southern Indiana during the Civil War.         Miss McGuire remained strongly interested in the stage long after she established herself as a movie actress. In the mid-1940's, she, Mr. Peck, Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Mel Ferrer and other actors formed  the La Jolla Players, a repertory company in California. Over the years, she also appeared in several stage productions in New York, including an adaptation of Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg, Ohio'' in 1958 and Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' in 1976. Walter Kerr, reviewing ''The Night of the Iguana'' for The New York Times, said Miss McGuire played the role of the spinster ''with great charm and intelligence.''         Dorothy Hackett McGuire was born on June 14, 1918, in Omaha, Neb., the daughter of Thomas Johnson McGuire, a lawyer, and Isabelle Flaherty McGuire. She showed an early talent for the stage and began to act in the Omaha Little Theater.  Her parents' marriage failed, and after her father's death when she was 14, she was sent to a convent school in Indianapolis, where she pursued her interest in acting and played the role of the Virgin Mary in one production. (Years later, she was cast again as the Virgin Mary in George Stevens's 1965 film, ''The Greatest Story Ever Told.'') After leaving the convent school, she went to Pine Manor Junior College in Wellesley, Mass., where she was president of the Mimes and Masks drama club.         Graduating from Pine Manor at 19, she came to New York, determined to work as an actress while supporting herself as a model. If anyone asked what she liked to do in her spare time, she would say that she enjoyed Edna St. Vincent Millay's poetry and Debussy's music.         In 1938 she got a break of sorts, when she was selected to be Martha Scott's understudy in Thornton Wilder's hit play ''Our Town.'' When Miss Scott went to Hollywood, Miss McGuire took over the role. She did well, but the critics had already seen the play, and her efforts went largely unnoticed, except by her fellow actors. In the late 1930's she played in the road company of ''My Dear Children'' (a vehicle for John Barrymore) and appeared with Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong and Maxine Sullavan in ''Swingin' the Dream,'' a musical version of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' that flopped.         But in 1941 she heard that the producer John Golden and the author Rose Franken were looking for someone to play the title role in ''Claudia,'' Miss Franken's play  about a child-wife. Miss Franken and Mr. Golden had already auditioned  and rejected 208 actresses for the role, made familiar by Miss Franken's 2 novellas and 22 short stories about the character.         Miss McGuire was so intimidated by the prospect of auditioning for the role that she almost didn't try out. She knew that she tended to be rather mechanical when she read lines for the first time and didn't think Miss Franken would approve of her. But Miss Franken saw through the stiffness of the audition and concluded that Miss McGuire would be perfect for the part.         She was right; the production was a great success. Writing in The Times, Brooks Atkinson said that although Miss McGuire was ''a little inexperienced as an actress, she is personally genuine; the charm she radiates across the play is not merely a theater mannerism.''         Miss McGuire's appearance in ''Claudia'' earned her a special award from the Drama League for the best performance in 1941 by a young actor. She went on tour with the play in June 1942 and a year later arrived in Hollywood to recreate the role on film with Robert Young as her husband, David. ''Claudia'' was a hit, and so was its sequel, ''Claudia and David,'' in which Claudia becomes a mother.         The next two decades proved to be especially productive for Miss McGuire. Among her films were ''The Enchanted Cottage'' (1945), in which she and Young starred again, and  ''Till the End of Time'' (1946), in which she played a war widow, and Robert Mitchum and Guy Madison portrayed veterans trying to cope with civilian life. In 1950 she toured with the La Jolla Players in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' and also starred with Burt Lancaster and Edmund Gwenn in ''Mister 880,'' a charming movie about a small-time counterfeiter.         In 1951 she returned to Broadway to appear opposite the young Richard Burton in ''Legend of Lovers,''  Kitty Black's adaptation of a play by  Jean Anouilh. Although critics liked Miss McGuire, they did not approve of the production, and it closed after only 22 performances.         Her other films included ''Invitation'' (1952), ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954), ''Trial'' (1955), ''A Summer Place'' (1959) and William Inge's ''Dark At the Top of the Stairs'' (1960). During this period she also acted in television, especially for the Hallmark Theater.         She also had roles in the films ''Mother Didn't Tell Me'' (1950), ''I Want You'' (1951), ''Callaway Went Thataway'' (1951), ''Make Haste to Live'' (1953), ''This Earth Is Mine'' (1959), ''The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker'' (1959), ''Swiss Family Robinson'' (1960) and ''Flight of the Doves'' (1971). She was a voice actor in ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' (1973).         Miss McGuire was married to John Swope, a photographer and producer who died in 1979. Miss McGuire is survived by her daughter and a son, Mark Swope.         After her husband's death, she accepted fewer roles. But she did appear in a Los Angeles production of Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest'' in 1982 and in Phil Penningroth's ''Ghost Dancing,'' a 1983 television movie in which she played a frail, eccentric widowed farmer  who dynamites a reservoir in a battle over water.         Reviewing it in The Times, John O'Connor said that Miss McGuire was ''an actress whose presence has been unfailingly elegant'' and that she gave ''a performance of powerful dignity.'' It was praise she was used to hearing.       
         Elaine Dannheisser, a longtime collector of contemporary art who gave most of her collection to the Museum of Modern Art, died on Sunday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton.         Her death was announced by a spokeswoman for the Modern, who said that she had died in her sleep.         During the 1980's in particular, Mrs. Dannheisser was a fixture on the international art circuit who rarely missed an exhibition, art fair or auction. She was famous for her malapropisms, consistently referring to the Reina Sofia, a prominent museum of modern art in Madrid, as the Sophia Loren and once telling a friend that she did not approve of ''unanimous sex.''         Mrs. Dannheisser considered her holdings ''a living collection'' and continually sold off and bought new works, often after pursuing them a great while. Although her taste tended to follow existing trends, she became increasingly drawn to what she called ''tough'' art as her self-education as a collector continued.         Elaine Fansling was born in Brooklyn in 1923. Her father was a florist, and her mother was a painter who frequently took her daughter to museums. She studied painting at the Art Students League, began working as an illustrator and continued to paint until her interest in collecting took over.         In 1953, she married Werner Dannheisser, a refugee from Nazi Germany and an owner of a successful engraving company who dabbled in collecting. With her drive and his money, the couple progressed from modern to contemporary, buying works by Picasso, Leger and Rouault, and then Dubuffet, Rothko, Rauschenberg and Agnes Martin. She often said she wished she could have lived in Paris when Gertrude Stein did, but gradually realized that she could be equally involved with the art of her own time.         Mr. Dannheisser sold his business in 1981, just as the East Village art scene was taking off and contemporary-art collecting became a very competitive sport. Mrs. Dannheisser bought a building on Duane Street in TriBeCa for the display of the collection and, with an allowance from her husband, began actively purchasing works by neo-Expressionist and graffiti artists.         In the mid-1980's, she decided these works were not demanding enough. She sold many of them and, with the profits, became one of the first collectors to buy the work of emerging artists like Robert Gober, Jeff Koons and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and, later, Matthew Barney. The collection became international in scope and more Minimalist, Conceptualist and installationist in orientation, with most artists represented by at least two, and sometimes as many as 10, works.         Unlike many collectors of contemporary art, she did not seek out friendships with artists, saying that knowing them could cloud her judgment. One of her few artist friends was Jim Hodges, who worked as caretaker and preparator at her Duane Street building in return for free studio space in the building's basement.         Mrs. Dannheisser's involvement with museums also had phases. She served on the boards of the New Museum of Contemporary Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum before settling on the Modern.         She joined the Modern's painting and sculpture committee in 1990. In 1996 she became a trustee at the Modern and also gave the museum 75 works by 28 artists, one of the largest gifts in its history. Among other things, it included works by Mr. Gober, Mr. Koons and Gonzalez-Torres as well as Bruce Nauman, Sigmar Polke, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth and Joseph Beuys.         In the 1990's, Mrs. Dannheisser's collection had quite a bit of competition from her avid interest in bridge, but she continued to buy, and to sell, art until her death.         Her husband died in 1992, and there are no immediate survivors. A spokeswoman for the Museum of Modern Art said yesterday that Mrs. Dannheisser bequeathed additional works by Willem de Kooning, Richard Prince, Cady Noland and Ashley Bickerton to the Modern, along with a cash gift of $2 million. All her other assets will go to establishing the Elaine Dannheisser Foundation.         Correction:  November 9, 2001, Friday  An obituary of the art collector Elaine Dannheisser on Oct. 30 misstated her maiden name. It was Hanfling, not Fansling.       
         Barbara L. Kaiser, a former judge of Westchester County Family Court, died on Sept. 26 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84. A former resident of Westchester, she lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born in Brooklyn, she earned a law degree at Columbia University and practiced law in Westchester before becoming a judge.         She was a founding member and the second president of the Women's Bar Association of Westchester.         In 1987, Judge Kaiser, who opposed compulsory retirement for judges, reached 70, the state's mandatory retirement age for Family Court judges, and could not finish her elected 10-year term.         Her husband, Dr. Irwin H. Kaiser, whom she married in 1938, died in 1999. Her survivors include two daughters, Dr. Susan Kaiser of Manhattan and Margaret Kaiser of St. Paul; four sons, Peter, of Zurich; Dr. Richard, of New Rochelle, N.Y.; Steven, of Sacramento; and Dr. James, of Columbia, Md.; 15 grandchildren; and a sister, Judith Pestronk of Lido Beach, N.Y.       
         Ruth Goetz, a playwright who collaborated with her husband, Augustus Goetz, on ''The Heiress'' and other plays, died Friday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 93 and had been living in the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood.         ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of the Henry James novel ''Washington Square,'' brought the Goetzes great success when it opened on Broadway in 1947. They also wrote the screenplay for the 1949 film version directed by William Wyler. The play was revived in 1995 by Lincoln Center Theater and received Tony Awards for best revival and for Cherry Jones as best actress.         Through her work with the Dramatists Guild and the Young Playwrights Festival, Mrs. Goetz became known as a mentor and encourager of young playwrights. ''Ruth would go anywhere to see a play and was always searching out new writers,'' John Guare said this week. ''She was also a wonderful keeper of the record of our times and knew who was what and when.'' Sinclair Lewis, H. L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker and George S. Kaufman were among her many friends.         She was born in Philadelphia in 1908 and had her first indoctrination into theater from her father, Philip Goodman, a theatrical producer. At the beginning of her career, she was a story editor and costume designer. After she and Mr. Goetz were married in 1931, they began writing plays together. Their first, ''Franklin Street,'' written with Arthur Sheekman and based on Mr. Goodman's autobiography, closed out of town.         Their next, ''One-Man Show,'' which had a brief run on Broadway in 1945, was set in the world of art dealers and was about the relationship between a father and daughter.         Searching for a subject, Mrs. Goetz suggested to her husband that they dramatize ''Washington Square,'' about a domineering father and his painfully shy daughter. After the couple finished the play, a producer persuaded them to contrive a happy ending, in which the daughter, Catherine, reconciles with her faithless suitor. The play, then named ''Washington Square,'' was a failure in Boston.         The Goetzes rewrote it, restoring their original ending. With Jed Harris as the director, the play was recast with Basil Rathbone as the father and Wendy Hiller as the daughter. When ''The Heiress'' opened on Broadway, Brooks Atkinson wrote a harsh review in The New York Times, saying that the James ''story cannot be dramatized.''         ''We hadn't put the novel onstage,'' Mrs. Goetz said years later. ''It was a different story -- the daughter's finding herself through her tragedy.'' Other reviews were favorable, and the play became a Broadway hit, running for 410 performances.         Soon it was an international success both on the stage and on the screen, and, Mrs. Goetz said, ''it gave James, long in his grave, the best seller he never had.'' The movie version starred Ralph Richardson, Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift (as Catherine's suitor). For her performance, Ms. de Havilland won an Academy Award as best actress. The play has been revived frequently, and in 1974 it was transformed into an opera.         The Goetzes followed ''The Heiress'' with their adaptation of ''The Immoralist'' by André Gide, which opened on Broadway in 1954. In his review in The Times, Mr. Atkinson said, ''Magnificently acted by a company led by Geraldine Page and Louis Jourdan, 'The Immoralist' is an admirable piece of work that retains the integrity of Gide and does credit to the taste of the Goetzes.'' In the play, James Dean made his Broadway debut in a small role as a native houseboy.         Together, the Goetzes wrote the screenplay for, among other movies, ''Carrie'' (1952, adapted from Theodore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie'' and starring Laurence Olivier) and ''Stage Struck'' (1957). ''The Hidden River,'' adapted from a Storm Jamison novel, starring Robert Preston, was their last Broadway collaboration. It, too, was in 1957, the year that Mr. Goetz died.         On her own, Mrs. Goetz wrote ''Sweet Love Remember'd,'' a play about her husband. During the first week of the tryout, the star, Margaret Sullavan, died, and the play closed in New Haven. Mrs. Goetz later adapted ''L'Amour Fou'' by André Roussin into ''Madly in Love.''         She is survived by her daughter, Judy Goetz Sanger, a poet, and a granddaughter, Katie Firth, an actress. Both live in Manhattan.         Speaking about the art of playwriting, Mrs. Goetz said, ''Dramatization is imagination made palpable, or visible, or understandable -- instantly.'' It is, she said, ''the imaginer's highest moment.''       
         Lady Jean Rankin, who held an archaic job as a Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, for more than 40 years, died in Edinburgh on Oct. 3. She was 96.         A kind of lady-in-waiting, a Woman of the Bedchamber attends to a queen's personal tasks, answers the majority of her correspondence and attends less formal functions with her.         The higher-ranking Ladies of the Bedchamber, usually the wives of earls, go to formal events with the queen, taking care of her umbrellas and gloves and so forth, according to Jerrold M. Packard in ''The Queen and Her Court: A Guide to the British Monarchy Today.''         Both groups are called ladies-in-waiting, usually work for two weeks at a time on a rotating basis and are unpaid except for essential expenses. They serve ''because they are personal friends of the queen, or for the honor and kudos the work undoubtedly brings,'' Alan Hamilton wrote in ''The Royal Handbook.''         Lady Jean, who was appointed a Woman of the Bedchamber in 1947, was only five years younger than the Queen Mother and was the last of her ladies-in-waiting to have been almost of the same generation. She accompanied the queen on tours to Paris in 1951, Norway in 1953, the United States and Canada in 1954 and Australia in 1958.         Lady Jean called the Queen Mother ''an easy boss to work for'' and was by her side when she had surgery, as well as when such nasty details as money had to be addressed on shopping expeditions.         The Times of London noted that Lady Jean was a close friend of Princess Margaret, and ''played a pivotal role during her fraught relationship with Group Captain Peter Townsend, acting as a go-between and counselor, especially during the sad period after the princess decided to call off their engagement.''         She continued to serve until 1982, when she became an Extra Woman of the Bedchamber. Until 1994, when she moved to a nursing home in Edinburgh, she continued to serve the Queen Mother from time to time, mainly accompanying her to private dinner parties.         She became something of a celebrity in her own right. The Times wrote: ''She was unflappable, conscientious, but at the same time witty and charming, with a sense of fun to match that of her boss. They suited each other down to the ground.''         Jean Margaret Florence Dalrymple was born in Oxenfoord Castle, Midlothian, on Aug. 15, 1905. Her father, the 12th Earl of Stair, owned a 75,000-acre estate. She spent her youth living in two family castles and in London. She was educated entirely by governesses.         When she was 18, she joined the editorial staff of Queen magazine, a weekly periodical. The Times observed that this was considered ''a fairly racy thing to do.''         The Daily Telegraph reported that in 1931 she met Niall Rankin, a wildlife photographer, and they soon announced that they intended to marry. Lord Stair was unwilling to bless the union because Mr. Rankin had never met his own father, due to his parents' separation. Moreover, he had no money.         So Mr. Rankin finally made the acquaintance of his father, Sir Reginald Rankin. The elder Mr. Rankin was so taken with Miss Dalrymple that he promised to leave his son all his money, The Telegraph said.         They were engaged in July 1931, and Sir Reginald died in September, leaving them a small fortune. The couple married a month later. Mr. Rankin built a reputation as a wildlife photographer and ornithologist and in 1935 received the Wild Life Photography Award of the Year from Hermann Göring.         In 1937, they bought an estate of 1,900 acres on the Isle of Mull. The property came with a 320-acre chain of inhabited islands. They planted rhododendrons and azaleas and bred geese, which Lady Jean continued to raise after Mr. Rankin's death in 1965. The property became a wildlife sanctuary in 1994.         Lady Jean is survived by her son Ian. Another son, Alick, died of cancer in 1999.         During World War II, Lady Jean worked in the Child Recovery Bureau of the Women's Voluntary Service finding homes for orphans, while her husband performed secret missions as a soldier in China. The couple's London home was destroyed by a bomb.         After her appointment in 1947, Lady Jean was in the royal court for three or four two-week periods a year. She spent much of her time farming on the Isle of Mull.         Her legacy was as a footnote to royal events. Elizabeth Longford in ''The Queen Mother'' recorded her remark about the convenience of the Royal Yacht for a traveling queen, as well as telling of the time she and the queen were thrown to the floor of their touring car in Tasmania when the car stopped suddenly.         The New York Times reported in November 1954 that the Queen Mother, whose daughter's coronation had taken place a year earlier, stopped by a day-care center during a visit to New York. She tried to quiet a crying child by offering him some macaroni and cheese.         He was comforted only when Lady Jean picked him up and held him in her arms.       
         Eileen Shanahan, a reporter for The New York Times who broke ground in the male-dominated world of economic news and later a news executive at other papers, died here today. She was 77.         She had been suffering from heart problems and rheumatoid arthritis, her daughter Mary Beth Waits said.         In 1971, The Washington Post reported an incident involving Ms. Shanahan and Maurice Stans, then head of the Department of Commerce, which Ms. Shanahan covered as a leading economic reporter for The Times. Mr. Stans had invited Ms. Shanahan to a reporters' lunch and, when she arrived, she found that the men who worked her beat were not there and that all the other reporters at the lunch were women.         ''Is this a ladies' luncheon?'' The Post quoted her as having asked loudly. Told that it was, she said: ''Then, in that case, I can't stay. I hope you will tell the secretary my reason for leaving. I consider it insulting to lump all women reporters together in a separate class.''         In addition to her work at The Times, from 1962 to 1977, Ms. Shanahan was an assistant managing editor at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Washington Star, and she was a reporter for The United Press, the Research Institute of America and The Journal of Commerce.         She was a speechwriter for the Treasury Department in the Kennedy administration and assistant secretary for public affairs in the Health, Education and Welfare Department under Jimmy Carter.         Ms. Shanahan left The Times in anger in 1977 after she found that, although she was regarded as one of the leading reporters in the Washington bureau, her salary ranked halfway down the list, according to an account by a Times colleague, Nan Robertson. Every reporter who was paid more was a man.         In her book ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992),  Ms. Robertson described Ms. Shanahan's reaction.         Ms. Shanahan said: ''I had always assumed that I was the victim of a degree of salary discrimination, probably on the unjust rationale that I didn't need the money because I had a husband with a good job.''         ''But in my darkest hour,'' she continued, ''I never imagined that my pay would place me in the lower half of the bureau's reporters.''         During this period, a group of women at The Times filed a discrimination suit against the newspaper. Ms. Shanahan was one of the original plaintiffs, but she had left the paper by the time it was settled in 1978. The Times paid $350,000 to settle the lawsuit and agreed to place significant numbers of women in all levels in every department. Later, efforts were made to equalize men's and women's salaries.         Ms. Shanahan was single-minded on the trail of a story and had a reputation for being sharp-tongued  with officials. ''She yelled at bureaucrats who were uncooperative,'' said Richard E. Mooney, who covered economics with her at The Times. A 1966 profile in Forbes magazine, headlined ''Eileen, the Giant Killer,'' described how she decided to write groundbreaking articles about abuses in the mutual fund industry.         She said that she had gotten the idea after noticing the way mutual fund companies entertained their regulators at a convention of the state commissioners who help to regulate the securities markets.         ''I'm not easily shocked,'' she told Forbes. ''I've been in Washington all my life. I was a Washington correspondent for The Journal of Commerce and a tax information officer for Douglas Dillon before I joined The Times. I've seen lobbyists entertain. I tell you this was shocking. They smelled up the hotel. I said to myself, If they feel they have to entertain the commissioners in this way to protect themselves against regulation, there must be something wrong.''         Ms. Shanahan grew up in Washington and received a bachelor's degree  from George Washington University in 1944. While in college, where she studied political science, she worked one summer as a clerk at The Washington Post. There, she met another George Washington student, John V. Waits Jr., whom she married in 1944. He died in 1995.         In addition to Ms. Waits, of Silver Spring, Md., Ms. Shanahan is survived by another daughter, Kathleen Waits of Tulsa, Okla.; a sister, Dr. Kathleen Shanahan Cohen of Teaneck, N.J.; and three grandchildren.         Mary Beth Waits related a technique her mother suggested she follow. ''If you're going in to a meeting with some man who you think is going to try to intimidate you,'' she had said, ''go in chewing gum. He may think you're crude, but he sure won't think you're intimidated.''       
         Peggy Mount, for many years the fearsome battle-ax of British stage and screen with a voice to make henpecked husbands tremble, died on Tuesday at a London nursing home for actors. She was 85.         Although best known for her bullying, harridan roles, Ms. Mount was also successful in classical theater with much praised performances as the nurse to Judi Dench's Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's memorable Old Vic production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' in 1960 and in the title role of Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' at the Birmingham Repertory Theater in 1977.         She also made movies with major stars like Peter Sellers in ''The Naked Truth'' (1957) and Alec Guinness and Gina Lollobrigida in ''Hotel Paradiso'' (1966).         In the three years she played Emma Hornett, the iron-fisted, foghorn-voiced prospective mother-in-law in the 1955 West End farce ''Sailor Beware'' and in the subsequent film, Ms. Mount first made her name. One critic wrote of her performance in ''Sailor Beware'' that  ''with her hair scrapped up from her neck in a tight roll of curls, she is more intimidating than a fixed bayonet -- and with a voice to match.''         In 1971 she said, ''I'm not Lady Macbeth and never had any yearnings to be.''         Margaret Rose Mount was born on May 2, 1916, at Southend on Sea, the Essex seaside resort. Her childhood was unhappy. Her father died when she was 9, and she did not get along well with her mother.         The family's poverty forced her to leave school at 14 and work as a secretary. She discovered theater through the drama society at her church and studied acting privately.         She never married and left no immediate survivors.         She began her acting career in 1944 in repertory theater in the north of England and traveled all over the country until the success of ''Sailor Beware'' established her reputation.         She played similar dragon roles as Ada in a popular British television series called ''The Larkins'' in 1958 and in a similar series titled ''George and the Dragon'' in 1966. Later television credits included ''You're Only Young Twice'' and an appearance as a formidable Sister of Mercy in the ''Inspector Morse'' series.         During the rest of her career she continued to mix comedy with serious drama in London or on tour and the stage with films. In the 1970's she was a member of the National Theater Company, winning plaudits for her appearances in ''Il Campiello'' by Goldoni and Ben Travers's ''Plunder.''         From 1983 to 1985 she acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company in several plays, including ''The Dillon,'' ''Measure for Measure'' and a revival of the school farce ''The Happiest Days of Your Life.''         She was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1996.         She ended her career in 1998 when she lost her sight during a performance of Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya.''         ''The audience had no idea,'' she said. ''But the word soon got out, and I lost my nerve. Not working is my greatest regret. It was always my wish to die working.''       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963, and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died yesterday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks, from 40 to 60, she needs personality, and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot high ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to the old and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from the Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink top-of-the line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account. Her second husband planned to go into the business with her but died of a heart attack a month before the start of the business. She decided to carry on with her plans, despite the advice of her lawyer and her accountant. The business opened with nine saleswomen and her 20-year-old son, Richard Rogers, a sales representative for Prudential Life Insurance, as financial administrator.         The skin-care products that formed the basis of the company were developed by J. W. Heath, an Arkansas tanner who noticed that his hands looked younger than his face and began experimenting with the solution he used in his work. The formulas were passed on to his daughter, Ova Heath Spoonemore, who, sometime later, acted as the hostess at a Stanley Home Products party where Mrs. Ash was conducting the demonstration. When that part of the get-together was over, Mrs. Spoonemore handed out jars with penciled labels to her guests, all of whom had beautiful skin. She explained to Mrs. Ash that the women were her guinea pigs. Mrs. Ash, who also received some samples, became a fan and in 1963 bought the formulas from the Heath heirs for $500.         The philosophy of the fledgling company was based on three principles enunciated by Mrs. Ash -- treating others as they themselves would like to be treated, putting God first, family second and career third, and the belief that with praise and encouragement, everyone could succeed.         Although the product line was added to over the years -- there are now more than 200 items for women and men in skin, hair, nail and body care and sun protection -- the Mary Kay formula for success changed little. Consultants remained independent, buying products at wholesale and selling at retail, and from the beginning there were no accounts receivable or personal checks accepted. Orders are paid for with cashier's checks, money orders or credit cards, and consultants are encouraged to conduct their own business in the same way.         In addition to her financial policy, Mrs. Ash also decided that there would be no fixed territories. Consultants who line up recruits in other cities and states still receive commissions on the recruits' purchases although the newcomers are trained and guided by the directors in their home territories. The unusual system worked because, as Mrs. Ash put it, ''each sales director thinks 'I'm helping her but someone else is helping my recruits in other cities.' ''         Shares of Mary Kay were listed in 1968, first in the over-the-counter market and eight years later on the New York Stock Exchange. In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas, 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''       
         Edith Schwartz Capa, who helped found the International Center of Photography in Manhattan in 1974, died Wednesday at her Midtown home. She was 88.         She laid the foundations of the center's collections as the wife of Cornell Capa, an international photographer and its founding director emeritus. She organized and maintained the negatives and archives of Mr. Capa and his brother, Robert Capa, another renowned photographer.         She supported the staff in many ways without holding an official position at the center. She also became a den mother to hundreds of photographers. Like the Capas, she was born in Budapest. She married Mr. Capa in 1940 and for 30 years accompanied him around the world on his assignments for Life magazine and the Magnum photo agency.         She is survived by her husband  and a sister, Miriam Siegel of Lutz, Fla.       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963 and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died Thursday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks; from 40 to 60, she needs personality; and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better-known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to her old  and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day, multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink, top-of-the-line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled the Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years.         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called the Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account.

         Rachel Gurney, the British actress best known to American audiences as the elegant Lady Marjorie Bellamy on the popular 1970's serialized drama ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' has died, according The Daily Telegraph of London. She was 81.         With fine features and a delicate stiff upper lip, Ms. Gurney was a natural for the role of Lady Marjorie, the wealthy Edwardian matriarch at the heart of the show, which chronicled three decades in the lives of an upper-class British family (upstairs) and their servants (down). Produced by London Weekend Television, the series was imported to the United States in 1973 as part of the Public Broadcasting Service's ''Masterpiece Theater,'' and instantly became one of most popular shows on public television.         Ms. Gurney's character proved particularly popular with viewers, who regularly sent fan mail addressed to her -- or her character -- to the show's fictional address, 165 Eaton Place, London. After two seasons with the show, however, Ms. Gurney left the program in a dramatic finale, as Lady Marjorie sailed to America -- almost -- on the maiden voyage of the Titanic.         Ms. Gurney's career proved considerably more bouyant. She was born in Eton, where her father was a housemaster at the school and where she was raised among the all-male student body. Her mother was a concert pianist, and Ms. Gurney soon found herself drawn to the arts, taking classes at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and later gravitating to London's West End.         For years before ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' Ms. Gurney found steady work in the theater, playing modern and classical roles, including a 1955 turn as Portia in ''The Merchant of Venice'' and a 1965 run of ''A Winter's Tale,'' in which she played Hermione alongside John Gielgud. She also performed in several roles on television series for the BBC, though none as popular as Lady Marjorie.         It was only after she left ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' that Ms. Gurney was seen on the stage in New York, making her American stage debut in 1977 in a production of George Bernard Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell.'' She appeared on Broadway three times, including in ''The Dresser'' in 1981 and in ''Breaking the Code,'' with Derek Jacobi, in 1987. She would work with Sir Derek a year later in a trumpted production of ''Richard II'' in London.         She was married briefly, but divorced in 1950. She is survived by a daughter, according to The Telegraph.         For an actress so associated with highbrow entertainments, Ms. Gurney's true personality was considerably more humble. She claimed to hate opening nights -- ''I'm always awful'' -- and initially declined the role that ended up defining her career.         ''I'm not a heavyweight actor,'' she said in a 1981 interview. ''I don't crave great classic roles. I crave a part with a lot of laughs.''       
         Patricia A. Locke, who worked for decades to preserve American Indian languages and became a pioneer in an effort to grant the tribes greater authority in the education of their children, died on Oct. 20 at a hospital in Phoenix. She was 73 and lived in Wakpala, S.D., on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Winona Flying Earth.         Ms. Locke, of Lakota and Chippewa heritage, won a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1991 for her work to save tribal languages that were growing extinct throughout the United States.         The award followed more than two decades of her advocacy for better education of Indians. In the 1970's, she was appointed to the Interior Department Task Force on Indian Education Policy, and eventually helped write legislation granting tribes the authority to set up their own education departments instead of following state requirements.         Education departments and tribal education codes were ultimately created among more than 30 tribes around the country, and Ms. Locke also helped 17 tribes establish colleges they controlled.         Patricia Ann McGillis was born on Jan. 21, 1928, on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1951. She married Charles E. Locke in 1952; they divorced in 1975.         Ms. Locke taught for more than 40 years, from elementary to university level, and lectured on Indian issues throughout the United States. She worked to protect sacred Indian sites and, starting in 1993, was national coordinator of a coalition that pushed for passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments, federal legislation adopted in 1994 that allowed use of peyote for religious purposes.         Ms. Locke's Indian name was Tawacin Waste Win, which, her daughter said, means ''she has good consciousness -- compassionate woman.''         Besides her daughter, who lives in Wakpala, she is survived by a son, Kevin Locke, also of Wakpala, a performing artist who works to preserve Lakota music; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Rose Shapiro, the president of the New York City Board of Education during one of its stormiest times, died last Saturday at a retirement home in Lauderville, Fla. She was 97 and a former resident of Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Mrs. Shapiro, a campaigner for a strong parental voice in the schools, came to the board in 1963. Mayor Robert F. Wagner named her to a vacant seat and reappointed her to a full seven-year term two years later. She was the only woman on the board. Her colleagues ribbed her by referring to her as ''the sexy grandmother'' after adopting her proposal for sex education courses in the upper grades.         She was vice president of the board in mid-1967 and was voted acting president and president the following May. By then, Mayor John V. Lindsay was putting in place his plan for decentralizing the city's public schools system, starting with some demonstration districts.         One of the experiments in greater community control began with an elected local board for the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn. It soon became the eye of a storm when classroom teachers who were deemed ''unwanted'' by the district leaders were ousted.         The situation spun out of hand when classes resumed in the fall of 1968. An angry central board ordered the reinstatement of the teachers. The local board balked. The teachers, led by Albert Shanker, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, organized a walkout.         There were angry street confrontations in Brooklyn and the central board itself split on how to proceed. At the behest of Mayor Lindsay, the board was enlarged and the new members named by him pressed his case for quick decentralization throughout the system.         Mrs. Shapiro, favoring a more gradual, carefully planned approach, lost her position as president. She left the board in the spring to serve as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's special assistant for narcotics education programs. She also denounced Mayor Lindsay and the revamped school board. ''I believe I can say without equivocation,'' she said, ''that never in my experience has a city administration played such a disruptive role as has this administration.''         Mrs. Shapiro was born Rose Rubin in Russia and came to Ozone Park, Queens, as a toddler. Her parents afforded her a comfortable upbringing as the owners of a large general store.         She studied the history of education in night classes at City College for four years while working at a feature syndicate.         At 21, she married Morris Shapiro, a future civil rights lawyer. She became active in the League of Women Voters, but, with the couple's children in public school, she devoted her energy to the Parents and Teachers Association. In 1944 she was elected president of the citywide United Parents Association, helping to boost its strength from 80,000 to 250,000 dues-paying members in her four years in charge.         She also held leading positions in the Public Education Association and the Citizens Committee for Children. She attended several White House conferences on education.         Her husband died in 1985. She is survived by a son, James, a resident of Luxembourg; a daughter, Nina Agel of Manhattan; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Bella Cabakoff Wexner, a philanthropist and the matriarch of the Limited Inc., a multibillion-dollar retail chain that specializes in women's clothing, died last Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 93 and lived on the Upper East Side, where she moved from Columbus, Ohio, in 1992.         Mrs. Wexner, with a professional background in the clothing business, joined her son, Leslie H. Wexner of Columbus, when he incorporated the Limited in 1963, as did her husband, Harry, and her daughter, Susan. For the next 34 years she served as its corporate secretary-treasurer and as a close adviser to Leslie Wexner.         She helped build the company into one of the country's fastest-growing apparel retailers. By the late 1980's the Limited, based in Columbus, had become the parent of Henri Bendel, Lane Bryant, Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch, among others. Holdings now include Express stores, Lerner New York and a majority stake in Intimate Brands, which includes Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works and the White Barn Candle Company.         With her son, Mrs. Wexner in 1973 established the Wexner Foundation, which supports youth development programs, fellowships and Jewish agencies and temples. In the 1990's she devoted much of her time to charitable work at the foundation and directly for a long roster of charities in this country and in Israel, including the Jewish Agency, the Israel Education Fund of UJC, United Jewish Communities in Cleveland,  Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and Wexner Heritage Village, a large geriatric complex in Columbus.         She was born Bella Cabakoff in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and was taken to Columbus as a toddler. Even before she finished high school she worked for Federated Department Stores, where she became one of its youngest buyers.         She married Harry Wexner during the Depression and eventually they founded a women's apparel store. The Limited went public in 1969, with Mr. Wexner serving as chairman until his death in 1975.         In addition to her son and her daughter, of Manhattan, Mrs. Wexner is survived by four grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Dunnett, a Scottish historical novelist whose weighty works about Renaissance life attracted swarms of devoted fans in the United States, died on Friday in Edinburgh. She was 78.         Her best-known works, ''The Lymond Chronicles'' in six books and ''The House of Niccolò'' in eight, have inspired conventions, fan magazines, among them a quarterly called Kisses and Marzipan, and several Internet forums packed with lively speculation ranging from points of history to the pedigrees of her characters and the subtly wrought links between the heroes of the two series.         Mrs. Dunnett, more properly Dorothy, Lady Dunnett, tempted her fans with buried clues and red herrings that keep them reading and rereading the books.         Anne Malcolm, writing in the The New York Times Book Review last year, said the chronicles, although not widely known nearly 40 years after the first volume appeared, ''are almost certainly destined to be counted among the classics of popular fiction.''         ''Identifying just what it is that sets them apart from other works of historical romance is difficult,'' Ms. Malcolm wrote, although she cited a ''painter's eye for gorgeous detail'' and a ''vocabulary that sometimes outstrips the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.''         Ms. Malcolm described the protagonist of the first series, the fictional Francis Crawford of Lymond, a 16th-century Scot, as the perfect romantic hero, ''impossibly charming, elegant and accomplished; a brilliant swordsman; an inspired leader of men'' who was ''also highhanded, cynical and dangerous'' and not above employing a bit of violence when it suits his often veiled purposes.         For the uninitiated, the uncomprehending or those whose linguistic spectrum spans fewer than half a dozen languages, there is a guide to the minutiae of Mrs. Dunnett's work, ''The Dorothy Dunnett Companion'' by Elspeth Morrison, (Vintage Books, 2001), from which the reader can learn the common punishment for adultery (removal of the nose, by biting or other means) or a simple formula for hair dye involving leeches marinated in vinegar.         The companion offers a glimpse of the laborious process of writing the many-layered historical novels, which delve into the art, culture, manners and science of the times. Although Mrs. Dunnett said the novels drew on her own background in music, art and sailing, they also involved a great deal of travel in search of authentic detail as well as dizzying amounts of library research.         Until shortly before her death she was helping Ms. Morrison complete a second companion volume.         Mrs. Dunnett was born Dorothy Halliday on Aug. 25, 1923, in Dunfermline, Scotland. She grew up largely in Edinburgh and was at school at the same time as Muriel Spark at James Gillespie's School for Girls, the model for the academy in Ms. Spark's ''Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.''         She said it had never been her intention to become a writer of fiction. She studied music and art and took a job in Britain's Ministry of Information.         In 1946 she married her boss, Alastair Dunnett, and the couple moved to Glasgow, where Mrs. Dunnett was employed by the Board of Trade and continued her studies in singing and painting.         She had become a professional portrait painter when her husband, a banker, author, journalist and eventually an oil company executive, suggested she write a novel. He said: ''Make it a series. They're popular at the moment,'' she wrote. ''So (always cooperative) I did.''         Her first novel was rejected by five publishers in Britain, leading her husband to suggest she seek publication in the United States. ''They like long books in America,'' she quoted him as saying. The book was accepted with the proviso that it be cut, and ''The Game of Kings,'' the opening book of ''The Lymond Chronicles,'' was published by Putnam in 1961.         The other books in the Lymond series are ''Queen's Play,'' 1964, ''The Disorderly Knights,'' 1966, ''Pawn in Frankincense,'' 1969, ''The Ringed Castle,'' 1971, and ''Checkmate,'' 1975.         An idea of the complexity of Mrs. Dunnett's books can be seen in the list of characters, which, in ''Niccolò Rising,'' 1986, the first book in that series, takes up four pages peppered with historical kings, their mistresses, Medicis and merchants as well as invented characters.         The Niccolò series, about Nicholas de Fleury of Burgundy, a merchant, also includes ''The Spring of the Ram,'' 1987, ''Race of Scorpions,'' 1989, ''Scales of Gold,'' 1991, ''The Unicorn Hunt,'' 1993, ''To Lie With Lions,'' 1995, ''Caprice and Rondo,'' 1997, and ''Gemini,'' 2000.         She was also the author of a historical novel about Macbeth, ''King Hereafter,'' published in 1982, and seven mystery novels featuring Johnson Johnson, an agent in the guise of a portrait-painting yachtsman. The Johnson Johnson books, some published under the name Dorothy Halliday and released under varying titles, were originally known as ''Dolly and the Singing Bird,'' 1968, ''Dolly and the Cookie Bird,'' 1970, ''Dolly and the Doctor Bird,'' 1971, ''Dolly and the Starry Bird,'' 1973, ''Dolly and the Nanny Bird.'' 1976, and ''Dolly and the Bird of Paradise.'' 1983.         She collaborated with her husband and David Paterson on a work of nonfiction, ''The Scottish Highlands,'' published in 1988.         Mrs. Dunnett's husband died in 1998. She is survived by her sons, Ninian and Mungo, and two grandchildren.       
         Rosemary Brown, who as a middle-aged widow living in a London suburb in the 1960's said she had been in contact with history's most illustrious composers, offering as evidence hundreds of piano miniatures that she said Beethoven, Bach and others had ''dictated'' to her, died on Nov. 16 in London. She was 85.         The odd experiences she described -- which included shopping with Liszt (he was interested in the price of bananas) and watching television with Chopin (he was appalled) -- found a resonant audience in the era of the Beatles and flower power. More intriguingly, they attracted expert scrutiny and some approbation from such luminaries as Leonard Bernstein, along with tidal waves of more or less good-natured ridicule from most of the music establishment.         Mrs. Brown's credibility as a medium was buttressed by her own musical ignorance. She had just three years of piano instruction and could not play by ear or extemporize. There was no record player or radio in her home and she said she never went to concerts.         ''I seemed to lose control of my hands; it was as though someone were guiding them,'' she said of the first time she received a piece of music from Liszt.         Peter Katin, an outstanding interpreter of Chopin, was pleased to record many of the piano works, while the composer Humphrey Searle published an essay noting the similarity of Mrs. Brown's Liszt pieces with his later official compositions. Mr. Bernstein suggested he could ''buy,'' meaning accept, a piece by Rachmaninoff, but not much else.         André Previn, then conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, said that if the newfound compositions were genuine, they would best have been left on the shelf.         But the British composer Richard Rodney Bennett seemed entirely convinced, at least at the time. He said that when he was having trouble with a composition of his own, Mrs. Brown passed along Debussy's recommendation. It worked.         ''If she is a fake, she is a brilliant one, and must have had years of training,'' he said in an interview in Time magazine. ''Some of the music is awful, but some is marvelous. I couldn't have faked the Beethoven.''         Regardless of how much Western music may or may not have been enriched by posthumous contributions channeled by Mrs. Brown, there was scant doubt of her entertainment value. She set off waves of interest in several appearances on British Broadcasting Corporation radio shows, the first in 1969. In the United States, she played at Town Hall in New York and appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson, telling him that her sources said there was no sex in heaven.         She described the various composers in often humorous detail. Beethoven, she said, was no longer deaf and had lost ''that crabby look.'' Debussy wore ''very bizarre clothes'' and was ''a hippie type.'' Chopin kept screaming something in French; it turned out to be a warning that her bathtub was overflowing.         Later she enjoyed visits from the ghosts of other celebrated people, including Shakespeare, Van Gogh and St. Paul. All the visits, she contended, were intended only to prove the existence of an afterlife.         Rosemary Dickeson was born on July 27, 1916, in southwest London. Her father was an electrician and her mother a catering manager. The family's apartment was above a dance hall, and she won dance contests as a girl. But her father vetoed a dancing career.         The most significant event of her youth occurred when she was 7. She had a vision of an elderly man with long white hair, wearing a black gown. He said he was Liszt. ''He told me that when I grow up, he would give me music,'' she said.         ''I've always had the ability, ever since I can remember, to see and hear people who are thought of as dead,'' she said in an interview with Newsweek.         In 1943, she contracted polio, which left her left side weak. When she was 15, she took a job as a clerk at the post office. When walking home from work one day, she said a voice told her to take a different route. A bombing raid struck her usual route.         In 1948, she got an upright piano and took lessons for the third time; as always, they lasted about a year.         In 1952, she married Charles Brown, a government scientist who had once worked as a gardener for King Farouk of Egypt. In 1961, her husband and her mother died. She began visiting spiritualists active in the emerging New Age thinking.         In 1964, she suffered an accident at the school kitchen where she worked and resumed playing the piano during her long recovery. That was when Liszt returned, as promised. She recognized him immediately, she said, and he arranged for the other composers to come, acting ''like sort of a reception desk.''         They took different approaches. Chopin told her what notes to play and pushed her fingers down on the right keys. Beethoven and Bach liked her to sit at a table and take dictation with a pencil. Schubert tried to sing his compositions, but ''he hasn't a very good voice,'' she said.         She was supported by contributions from people who believed in the occult. She wrote three books on her channeling, and made a number of recordings, some featuring her playing the easier pieces, the last in 1988. In the mid-1980's, the visits ceased as she fell into ill health. She is survived by a son and a daughter.         She always declined to ask her musical visitors the questions that outsiders thought would prove their existence. When Time offered her a list of 20 questions, she replied, ''I cannot push a button and call on the composers just like that.''         But when she needed notes for an album cover in 1970, Sir Donald Tovey, a musicologist, was pleased to provide them. ''It is the implications relevant to this phenomenon that we hope will stimulate sensitive interest,'' he said.         He had died in 1940.       
         Pauline Campanelli, a painter whose super-realist still lifes were so popular that their sales were rivaled only by those of Andrew Wyeth among living artists, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Pohatcong Township, N.J., a few miles south of Phillipsburg. She was 58.         Her husband, Dan, also a painter, said she died of complications from childhood polio. She had been seriously ill for nearly three years.         Her work was seldom reviewed; and when it was, the reviews generally ran in obscure publications. It was absent from prestigious art museums and expensive galleries. But in the nation's kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms, her precise, loving depictions of household objects were commonplace.         Her work recalled the Shakers in its simplicity and spirituality. Her later paintings were characterized by stark white backgrounds.         Hundreds of thousands of her prints were sold through mail-order catalogs, furniture stores and galleries specializing in prints and posters. Sales of her most popular picture, ''Wild Rose Berries,'' have exceeded 600,000.         ''She outsells Picasso,'' said Julie Fleischmann, president of Shorewood Fine Art, a unit of the New York Graphic Society, which licenses art and sells prints by both the Campanellis and Picasso.         Mrs. Campanelli described herself ''not as an artist who paints but as a person who lives.'' Her paintings, she said, were not creations ''but communications of the essence of that experience.''         She lived with her husband in a stone farmhouse they restored; it is included in the National Register of Historic Places. And despite needing a wheelchair to get around, she pursued dozens of homespun crafts.         Each year she canned 400 jars of fruit from the 39 trees the couple had planted. A talented quilter, cross-stitcher and yarn spinner, she used antique spinning wheels to turn fleece from her four Dorset sheep into yarn that she colored with dyes made from her homegrown herbs. The primitive American antiques she collected were frequent subjects for her paintings.         ''These are not the nostalgic relics of a long forgotten past, but objects that Dan and I live with every day,'' she said.         Her sensibility was decidedly not that of a folk artist. ''Whether it's a swan decoy or a quilt or a chair, I'm just looking at abstract shapes: rectangles, triangles, S-shapes, tall things, round things,'' she said in an interview in the journal U.S. Art in 1989. ''I am very much influenced by Mondrian's compositions.''         Another influence on her art was her belief in paganism. She wrote books, some with her husband, about witchcraft and pagan rituals and tried to bring her appreciation of ancient, pre-Christian ways to her rustic life as well as to her art.         Her book ''Ancient Ways: Reclaiming Pagan Traditions'' (Llewellyn, 1991) told how pagan cultures celebrated holidays, and it sold more than 40,000 copies. The Halloween section not only gave advice on charms and spells, crystal balls and using a tambourine to contact spirits but also gave a recipe for pumpkin bread. The May Day section said washing one's face with morning dew on that holiday would preserve a youthful complexion.         Pauline Eblé was born in the Bronx on Jan. 25, 1943. She was stricken with polio at 3 and was in an iron lung for a year and in the hospital for another year and a half. She was tutored at home and at 13 was studying college textbooks.         She was fascinated with the way her father, Joseph, a professional photographer, could condense three-dimensional reality into two-dimensional images, but she was not initially interested in art. She wanted to be a naturalist and illustrate the species she hoped to discover.         After finishing high school in Ridgewood, N.J., she attended the Ridgewood School of Art. She began selling still lifes while in school.         In 1969 she married Mr. Campanelli. According to a biography posted on the Llewellyn Web site, they were already practicing witchcraft. They lived in a $60-a-month furnished room painted bubble-gum pink and made a bare living, $2,000 the first year, from teaching and sidewalk art shows. Through competitions, bigger art shows and interest from galleries in the area, they gradually got their heads above water.         She earned a reputation for oil paintings of homey objects, and he drew attention for his watercolors of old mills and other historic scenes. In 1976 they bought a stone house built in 1835, naming it and the three surrounding acres Flying Witch Farm. Because they could not get a mortgage and had no savings, they had to restore the sagging, abandoned structure themselves.         He used antique tools because the house had no electricity to plug in power tools. She climbed down from her wheelchair and refinished the floors on her hands and knees.         They filled their new home with antiques like Cromwell chairs from the 1660's and a William and Mary side table from around 1690. Mrs. Campanelli copied a needlepoint design for the Cromwell chairs from museum slides.         Mr. Campanelli built a garage for the three Model A's he restored and a building to house his wife's ''natural history museum,'' which included at least 10,000 seashells. They pressed grapes in an 1860 fruit press and made 100 gallons of wine a year. They occasionally held what they called Colonial days for their friends, entertaining with a quilting bee, a black-powder shoot, a tomahawk throw and Colonial food.         Mrs. Campanelli, who is survived by her husband and father, painted standing on crutches in an 8-by-10-foot studio that used to be a bedroom. The light streamed through a rippled north window, the sort of light she thought Rembrandt liked.         She worked very slowly, averaging about six paintings a year. She meticulously showed each thread in a ball of yarn. She painted any flowers last, in order not to be hurried.         The Campanellis had long thought that a ghost inhabited Flying Witch Farm: that of Mary Insley Hunt, a member of the family that long owned the place.         ''I think Pauline's going to be the next one,'' her husband suggested. ''She wanted to be.''       
         Mary Whitehouse, a British schoolteacher and mother of three who for more than 30 years campaigned vociferously against sex, violence and blasphemy on television, stage and screen, died on Nov. 23 in Colchester, England. She was 91.         Variously called ''the most dangerous woman in Britain,'' ''the Queen of Clean'' and ''the Archangel of Anti-Smut,'' Mrs. Whitehouse became in the end a beloved national institution, though she achieved far less than she sought. She struggled tirelessly to quell a rising tide of libertarianism in British public entertainment as the country traversed the ''Swinging 60's'' and embraced the ''Permissive Society.''         Her case, put simply, was that television programs and theater obsessed with sex and violence would breed that kind of a society. Many people agreed with her.         She was not without effect. ''The Clean Up TV Campaign,'' which she started in 1964 and which the next year became the National Viewers and Listeners Association, influenced several pieces of British legislation.         These included the 1978 Protection of Children Act, which curbed the pornographic exploitation of minors; the Indecent Displays Acts of 1981, regulating shop window displays and magazine covers; the creation of a Broadcasting Standards Committee in 1988; and the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which dealt with television obscenity.         She was responsible for banning the Danish film ''The Sex Life of Jesus Christ'' in 1977. In 1979, she instigated Britain's first blasphemy trial in 52 years, which resulted in a suspended nine-month jail sentence for the editor of Gay News. In 1982, she brought, but later dropped, a private prosecution against Howard Brenton's play ''The Romans in Britain,'' which explicitly portrayed sexual acts.         Her bête noire was Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, the BBC's liberal director general from 1960 to 1969, whom she called ''the Devil incarnate.'' Not only did he ignore and snub her, he also used to throw darts at a picture of her he had acquired, which depicted her as having five breasts.         But even if the tasks she had set herself were possible, which seems doubtful today, her all-or-nothing, blunderbuss approach doomed her efforts to failure.         Beloved British comics were condemned along with obvious pornographers because they all used words like damn and bloody. Anything that included foul language, adultery or homosexuality was bad in her eyes, regardless of its artistic quality or overall moral stance.         As a result, she was soon attacking a lengthening list of admired and popular works, including the ''EastEnders'' television series; Lord Snowdon's acclaimed documentary about old age, ''Don't Count The Candles''; and Dennis Potter's ''Singing Detective.''         Mary Hutcheson was born in Nuneaton, in Cheshire, on June 13, 1910. She was a staunch Christian and member of the Moral Rearmament movement who at 20 fell in love with an older married man but left him when she saw the unhappiness she had caused his wife.         She trained as an art teacher, and in 1940 married Ernest Whitehouse, an engineer, who died last year. After raising three sons, who survive her, she returned to teaching in 1960, becoming senior mistress at a Shropshire secondary school, in charge of sex education.         This anonymous provincial existence changed in 1963 with the eruption of the Profumo sex scandal, when Mrs. Whitehouse was horrified to discover that her girls regarded Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, the two call girls at the center of the affair, as heroines and role models. The next year she started her Clean Up TV Campaign.         Correction:  December 20, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 3 about Mary Whitehouse, a British crusader against pornography, misidentified her native county. Her birthplace, Nuneaton, is in Warwickshire, not Cheshire.       
         Mercedes Matter, a painter, teacher and the chief founder of the New York Studio School in Greenwich Village, died on Tuesday. She was 87  and lived in East Hampton on Long Island.         Mrs. Matter was born Mercedes Carles in New York in 1913. Her father, the American modernist Arthur B. Carles, had studied with Matisse. Her mother, Mercedes de Cordoba, was a model for Edward Steichen. Ms. Matter grew up in Philadelphia, New York and Europe.         She began painting under her father's supervision at age 6, and studied art at Bennett College in Millbrook, N.Y., and then in New York City with Maurice Sterne, Alexander Archipenko and Hans Hofmann.         In the late 1930's, she was an original member of the American Abstract Artists organization and worked for the federal Works Progress Administration, assisting Fernand Léger on his mural for the French Line passenger ship company. Léger introduced her to Herbert Matter, the Swiss graphic designer and photographer, whom she married in 1939.         The Matters were active in the emerging New York art scene and also traveled frequently to Europe. Their closest friends included Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Alexander Calder and Willem de Kooning. They were also close to Alberto Giacometti, who was an important artistic role model for Mrs. Matter and a frequent photographic subject for her husband.         Beginning in 1953, Mrs. Matter taught at the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the Arts), Pratt Institute and New York University. Based on her teaching experiences she wrote an article for Art News in 1963 titled ''What's Wrong with U.S. Art Schools?'' In it, she lamented the phasing out of the extended studio classes required to initiate ''that painfully slow education of the senses,'' which she considered an artist's life work.         The article prompted a group of Pratt students to ask her to form a school based on her ideas, which led, in 1964, to the founding of the New York Studio School. Originally in a loft on Broadway, the school gained almost immediate support from the Kaplan Fund, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Ford Foundation. It granted no degrees, had only studio classes and emphasized drawing from life. Its teachers, chosen by the students, included the artists Guston, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Charles Cajori, Louis Finkelstein and Sidney Geist; the art historian Meyer Schapiro; and the composer Morton Feldman.         The Matters lived on Macdougal Alley, where Mr. Matter had a studio in one of the eight small buildings that had housed what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art. It was his idea that the buildings would make a perfect home for the Studio School, which bought them from the Whitney family in 1967.         Mrs. Matter practiced as she preached, spending months, and sometimes years, working on drawings and paintings that usually began as still lifes and evolved into near-abstractions animated by thatched lines that attested to her her devotion to the work of Giacometti and Cézanne.         In addition to her art and teaching, she wrote articles on artists, including Hofmann, Kline and Giacometti. She wrote the text for a book of her husband's photographs of Giacometti, published in 1987, four years after his death.         Mrs. Matter had her first solo show in New York at the Tanager Gallery in 1956. Her most recent was a double bill of drawings, shown in the Studio School's gallery, and paintings, at Salander O'Reilly Galleries. She taught at the school until last year.         She is survived by her son, Alexander, and a grandson, Jordan Matter, both of New York.       
         Faith Hubley, a three-time Academy Award winner whose 50 animated films often combined elements of myth, jazz and a deeply felt humanism, died on Friday in New Haven. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         For more than 45 years Ms. Hubley made a film a year, an achievement that Dan McLaughlin, head of the animation workshop at the University of California at Los Angeles, called unbelievable. Her first 21 films were made in partnership with her husband, John, before his death in 1977. Her newest film, ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' came out of the lab just a few days ago; its premiere is to be tomorrow at U.C.L.A., and it is to be shown Jan. 8 at the Museum of Modern Art as part of a celebration of Ms. Hubley's life.         Exploring what she called mythic landscapes, Ms. Hubley used primitive myths, magic and music and, in three classic films, the recorded voices of her four young children to comment on the world as it was, is and should be. A jazz fan who sometimes played the cello in her films, she used the works of Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter and Quincy Jones as background for what has been described as ''filmic poetry.'' Although the visual images of her later films evoke Miró and Klee, Ms. Hubley has described her films as close to cave painting. ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' not quite seven minutes long, paints the deep attachment the Inuit feel toward the earth.         Ms. Hubley once said that the central thread that runs through her impressionistic, dreamlike and often whimsical films is ''human development, with a strong emphasis on the importance of children as people and on the environment people live in.''         When Faith and John Hubley married in 1955 and began making films together, they had only two marriage vows, according to Ms. Hubley. ''One was to eat with the children,'' she said. ''The other was to make one independent film a year.''         The Hubleys kept both promises, and filmmaking became a family affair. They won their first Academy Award in 1959 for ''Moonbird,'' an impressionistic account of young children at play whose unique soundtrack was the recorded voices of their two sons, Mark and Ray. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would not change the name of the category in which they won from ''cartoons'' to ''animated films'' until 1971, but the Hubleys were already expanding cartoons beyond Disney.         Their second Oscar came in 1962, for ''The Hole,'' in which two construction workers debated nuclear destruction. Their third, in 1966, was for the buoyant ''Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature,'' in which the band plays on as more and more people crowd into its automobile.         The Hubleys' work was the subject of a retrospective in 1998 at the Museum of Modern Art.         Until John Hubley's death during heart surgery, Ms. Hubley was considered the lesser partner in their work. When they met, he was already well known. At Disney he had worked as an art director on ''Bambi,'' ''Dumbo,'' ''Pinocchio,'' and ''The Rite of Spring'' episode of ''Fantasia.'' Staunchly pro-union, he had left Disney during a bitter strike in 1941 and then was a founder of United Productions of America, where he helped move animation away from Disney with the creation of ''Mr. Magoo'' and ''Gerald McBoing-Boing.''         Ms. Hubley, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, had bolted from home at the age of 15 without finishing high school. Reticent in interviews about her childhood except to say that her parents had ''made no room for children,'' she created an intimate self-portrait on film in the 25-minute ''My Universe Inside Out'' (1996), which hints at child abuse and her parents' burning down the family house.         At 18, Ms. Hubley went to Hollywood. Because World War II had emptied the studios of young men, she got a job as a messenger at Columbia. She worked her way up to sound-effects editor, music editor and script clerk, and dreamed of being an independent filmmaker.         History gave her a shove in the right direction. Because of John Hubley's political activism, they were blacklisted. Returning to New York, they fed their growing family by working on commercials and educational films. Their first independent film, ''Adventures of an *,'' was finished the year after their marriage, right on schedule.         ''We could have been rich,'' Ms. Hubley recently told a reporter. ''But I told John, 'If you're an artist, you can't be a huckster.' ''         The Hubleys earned an Oscar nomination for ''Windy Day'' in 1968. This time the voices of the children were those of their two daughters, Emily and Georgia. In ''Cockaboody'' (1973), Emily and Georgia played at being grown-up mothers and glancingly mulled the death of their own mother.         When John died, the Hubleys were working on their 21st film, ''The Doonesbury Special.'' Finished by Ms. Hubley, Garry Trudeau and their longtime animator, Bill Littlejohn, the film became their seventh to be nominated for an Oscar.         After her husband's death, Ms. Hubley turned to larger themes and more abstract images. ''Step by Step'' (1979) projects mother love against the impossibility of protecting children in a world of foul water and limited food. ''Seers and Clowns'' (1994), which was animated by Ms. Hubley, both her daughters and Mr. Littlejohn, uses the words of Chief Seattle against metamorphosing images of wisdom and folly.         ''Faith was always timid about doing animation,'' said Mr. Littlejohn, who first worked with Ms. Hubley on the 1962 film ''The Hole.'' ''The strengths of her films were her brilliant designs and her strong ideas. And making one film a year is a standard no one else has approached.''         Ms. Hubley's solo films, usually a combination of her watercolor paintings and cel animation, often dealt in a poetic way with the treatment of women (''Witch Madness,'' 1999) and with pre-Christian myths. ''The Big Bang and Other Creation Myths'' gives no more credence to the scientific explanation of the beginning of the world than it does to half a dozen primitive beliefs.         At the time of her death, Ms. Hubley was a senior critic in the department of art at Yale University. In addition to her four children, she is survived by six grandchildren.         To the end, Ms. Hubley loved being an independent filmmaker. As she told an interviewer a few months ago: ''I am willing to pay the price: total financial anxiety all the time. I don't have any greed illusions. I need to eat, and that's that.''       
         Laurie Johnston, a World War II correspondent, an author and a reporter for The New York Times who was cited for the humanity and wit of her writing, died at her home in Honolulu on Friday. She was 87.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her daughter Elisa W. Johnston said.         Although she spent several months of the year in Hawaii, the island she came to love in the 1940's while covering the war in the Pacific for Reuters, Ms. Johnston was a ''dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker,'' her daughter said. Until just a few weeks ago, she was at the Greenwich Village home she moved into in 1954.         ''She spent her last few days walking around the World Trade Center site,'' Ms. Johnston said, ''and arrived in Honolulu quite frail but wearing an 'I Love New York' T-shirt.''         Ms. Johnston worked as a columnist, reporter and editor for The Times, covering neighborhoods, education and the courts, among other subjects. Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism awarded her the Meyer Berger Award for distinguished reporting in 1980, citing her ''consistently warm and perceptive glimpses of the little and large dramas of New York.''         Ms. Johnston was born in Fort Collins, Colo., and grew up in Albany, Ore. She studied English and journalism at the University of Oregon, and after graduating worked at several West Coast newspapers.         During World War II, she covered the Pacific from Pearl Harbor and was one of the few women accredited to report on both the Army and the Navy. In 1946 Ms. Johnston joined Newsweek's international news department, where she stayed until joining The Times in 1949. She retired in 1984.         In 1939 she married Richard W. Johnston, who was also a war correspondent and who eventually became the executive editor of Sports Illustrated. In 1953 she wrote ''Elizabeth Enters: The Story of a Queen'' (Scribners), a biography for which Mr. Johnston served as the picture editor. He died in 1981. Ms. Johnston later married Charles C. Woolley, who died in 1986.         In addition to Elisa Johnston, Ms. Johnston is survived by another daughter, Dana Johnston of New York City and Honolulu; a son-in-law, Barry Layne Morrison, and a granddaughter, Katie H. J. Morrison, all of Honolulu       
         Megan Boyd, whose fabled expertise at tying enchantingly delicate fishing flies put her work in museums and the hands of collectors around the world and prompted Queen Elizabeth II to award her the British Empire Medal, died Nov. 15 in Golspie, Scotland. She was 86.         She did not receive her award from the queen, to whom she explained that she had no one to care for her dog that day. The queen said she quite understood, and Prince Charles, an avid user of her flies, later made the presentation at his nearby Scottish fishing lodge in 1971.         The episode reflected Miss Boyd's unpremeditated eccentricity, also suggested by her usual dress: a man's shirt and tie, sweater, wool skirt, tweed sport jacket and heavy army-style boots. But the flies she dressed at a small table in front of a window and under a gas lamp -- she had no electricity until 1985 -- were regarded by connoisseurs as ''the Tiffanies of the 20th century,'' according to The American Fly Fisher magazine.         From tiny strands of hair she made magic: the classic Scottish flies like the Jock Scott, Silver Doctor and Durham Ranger; American favorites like the Green Butt and Woolly Hugger; and the fly named after her, the Megan Boyd, a nifty blue and black number famous for attracting salmon at the height of summer, when the water is low, hot and dead.         ''Her attention to detail was perfection par excellence,'' said Jimmie Ferard, an English fly fisherman who owns more than 2,000 of Miss Boyd's flies. ''She took such trouble with every fly she tied.''         She liked to sell to fishermen she knew, the ones who lived nearby. Her prices never exceeded a dollar.         ''A Megan Boyd fly is a $1,000 fly,'' said Gary Tanner, director of the American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vt.         Rosina Megan Boyd, the youngest of three children, is believed to have been born in England on Jan. 29, 1915. In 1918, her father took a job as a riverkeeper, or private game warden, on an estate in Sutherland County in the Scottish Highlands. Another keeper, Bob Trussler, taught her the craft by having her disassemble a finished fly and then reconstruct it on a smaller hook.         She had little formal education but loved to learn everything about the Brora, the river that flowed through the town of the same name where she grew up. During World War II, she held various jobs, including delivering milk and working for the coast guard auxiliary.         At 20, she moved into a small red-and-white cottage perched on a hillside in the village of Kintradwell, and she lived there for 53 years. By personal preference, she had no running water, electricity, telephone or television. She cut her own hair in a style the British call an Eaton crop.         Her studio was a corrugated iron shed with a rusted red tin roof. She spent 14 to 16 hours a day, six or seven days a week, at her workbench, a kidney-shaped dressing table.         But she was dedicated to supplying the fishermen she knew who fished rivers she had learned intimately. Under the mat at her front door was a pad and pencil for the locals to write down their orders.         ''As long as I was tying flies for the fishermen, which I started off doing to earn my daily bread, I kept doing it,'' she said in an interview with The Atlantic Salmon Fly. ''All the other orders had to go to the bottom of the pile.''         She retired in 1985, when she was 70, because of deteriorating eyesight.         ''I knew my eyesight was failing because I was making bigger heads on the flies,'' she said, ''and once you start to do that, it's no use.''         An aide to Prince Charles once showed up and asked that she quickly whip up a masterpiece or two. She declined, saying that was going to a Scottish dance in the village. She loved the traditional dances.         The prince held no grudge. He visited her last year in the nursing home where she had lived in recent years.         She would teach fly-tying to anyone who asked but she said she was unable to find a suitable heir.         ''There is just one man I taught that could tie a decent fly,'' she said. ''He is dead now. The modern ones just want to tie something quick and scrappy and sell it.''         Miss Boyd, who never married and has no survivors, never caught a fish. She never even went fishing.         ''I wouldn't kill a salmon if I got one,'' she said.
