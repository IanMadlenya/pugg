Dr. Lauretta Bender, a child neuro-psychiatrist, researcher and educator, died Jan. 4 in a nursing home in Annapolis, Md. She was 88 years old and lived in Annapolis.         Dr. Bender was known for developing, in 1923, the Bender-Gestault Visual Motor Test, a neuropsychological examination that has become a worldwide standard. She spent many years researching the cause of childhood schizophrenia and was responsible for studies on child suicides and violence.         In 1955, Dr. Bender received the Adolf Meyer Memorial Award for her contributions to the understanding of schizophrenic children.         She became a staff member of Bellevue Hospital in 1930 and later was senior psychiatrist in charge of the Children's Service at the hospital, a post she held for 21 years. Consulant to Children's Guild         Also in 1955, Dr. Bender was appointed principal research scientist in child psychiatry, a new post in the State Mental Hygiene Department. She continued working with the state until 1973, when she moved to Annapolis. Dr. Bender taught at the University of Maryland and was a consultant to the Children's Guild Inc., a group that works with emotionally disturbed youngsters, and similar organizations.         She was born in Butte, Mont. Dr. Bender graduated with a B.S. from the University of Chicago in 1922 and an M.A. in pathology in 1923. She received a medical degree from the State University of Iowa in 1926.         After completing her internship and residency at Billings Hospital of the University of Chicago, she became a resident psychiatrist at Boston Psychopathic Hospital from 1928 to 1929. From 1929 to 1930, Dr. Bender was a research associate in psychiatry at the Phipps Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital.         Dr. Bender was a member of such organizations as the American Psychiatric Association; the American Neurological Association, the American Academy of Child Psychiatry and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was also on the Citizen's Committee for Children of New York City Inc.         Dr. Bender had been married to Dr. Paul Schilder, a Viennese psychiatrist who was an associate of Freud. Dr. Schilder died in 1940. In 1968, Dr. Bender married Dr. Henry Banford Parks, a historian and professor at New York University. He died in 1973.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Peter Schilder of Annapolis; a daughter, Jane S. Knowles of Santa Fe, N.M.; three grandchildren, and a brother, Karl Bender of Milwaukee, Ore.

        Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         With her eye for the new and the lively, Mrs. Varian was best known in New York for the provocative shows of avant-garde art that she organized in the 1960's and 1970's as director of the contemporary wing of the Finch College Museum of Art. Among the more notable were a series called ''Art in Process,'' staged over an 11-year period ending in 1973, which exposed in detail the working methods and techniques of a number of contemporary artists; two ''Projected Art'' exhibitions of experimental films, videotapes and documentaries of artists at work; two Art Deco shows noted for scholarship and selectivity, and a documentary film by the artist Les Levine that portrayed the civil strife in northern Ireland. Mrs. Varian also taught courses in museology and art history at Finch.         Elayne Hanley was born in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1913. She was graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and later received a master's degree in fine art there. She came to New York in 1933 and worked for a while as a dress designer. She married John Varian, a lawyer, in 1936, and retired to raise their son.         In the mid-1940's, she joined the Duveen Brothers gallery, where she became assistant to the president, Edward Fowles, and remained there for 15 years. She went to Finch College as director of its contemporary museum in 1964, a position she held until the college closed for lack of funds in 1975.         In that year, Mrs. Varian moved to Orlando, where her husband had retired. For three years, she served as curator of contemporary art at the John and Mabel Ringling Museum in Sarasota. After leaving there in 1978, she did art appraisal work and mounted several shows as a freelance curator.         She is survived by her husband and by a son, Alfred, of Stowe, Vt.

        Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Miss Yourcenar was a cosmopolitan, versatile woman of letters who wrote in her native French. To English-speaking readers, she was best known for her fiction, especially her 1951 novel ''Memoirs of Hadrian.'' Her other writings included essays, memoirs and plays.         On hearing of her death, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France said yesterday in Paris: ''French letters has just lost an exceptional woman. On the strength of a classical and rigorous style, Marguerite Yourcenar used a very personal tone to find, thanks to history, the occasion for a strong reflection on morality and power.'' 'Words Will Be Read Forever'         Roger W. Straus, the president and chief executive officer of Farrar Straus & Giroux, which has published works by Miss Yourcenar, said yesterday in a statement released at the Manhattan headquarters of the publishing house: ''Marguerite Yourcenar was without question or doubt one of the great writers of the 20th century. She is a great loss to the literary community, but her words will be read and remembered forever.''         Born in Brussels of a French father and Belgian mother, Miss Yourcenar grew up in France and traveled widely. On a visit to the United States early in World War II, she decided to stay when, as she once put it, ''the months stretched into years as the war didn't end.'' For the next decade she taught comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College. She acquired United States citizenship in 1947 but was later reinstated as a citizen of France.         ''I am rootless,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To steal from Hadrian, 'I am at home everywhere and nowhere.' ''         Her induction into the Academie Francaise in 1981 was an accolade that had been denied to Mme. de Stael, Colette and other illustrious Frenchwomen in the four-century history of that prestigious society of 40 ''immortals,'' the arbiters of French language and literature. 'Let Their Shadows Pass'         Commenting on her induction, Miss Yourcenar said: ''This uncertain, floating me, whose existence I myself dispute, here it is, surrounded, accompanied by an invisible troupe of women who perhaps should have received this honor long before, so that I am tempted to stand aside to let their shadows pass.''         She also said the academy was not to blame for not admitting women sooner. ''One cannot say,'' she said, ''that in French society, so impregnated with feminine influences, the academy has been a notable misogynist: it simply conformed to the custom that willingly placed a woman on a pedestal but did not permit itself to officially offer her a chair.''         Miss Yourcenar was respected as a classical scholar as well as a literary stylist. The Oxford University classicist Hugh Lloyd-Jones, writing in The New York Times Book Review in February 1985, praised her ''ornamental and melliflous French prose, studded with the literary allusions which come so easily to such a cultivated writer.'' Mixing Scholarship and Magic         Miss Yourcenar once said her writing had ''one foot in scholarship, the other in magic arts,'' and her interests were diverse.         Shortly before her death, in an interview with Jean-Pierre Corteggiani for the new quarterly Normal, Miss Yourcenar spoke of her views on literature:         ''The books I like best are those where there is intelligence, goodness and no injustice. They are very rare indeed. I think that the reason there is so much bad literature, or at least one of the reasons, is that the average person who sets out to be a writer goes around looking for subjects to write about, and editors have the effrontery to ask you: 'Could you not possibly write a novel about . . . or an essay on . . .,' to which I always reply that I never write anything I have not chosen myself.''         Her works ranged from ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' - an imaginary autobiography of the Roman emperor written as a letter to his grandson Marcus Aurelius - to a volume of stories, ''Oriental Tales'' (first published in 1938 in French), that drew on the folklore of medieval Japan and other cultures. Translated American Spirituals         She also wrote plays, poems and prose poems and translated into French the lyrics of American spirituals as well as works by such authors as James Baldwin, the modern Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, Henry James, Thomas Mann, Yukio Mishima and Virginia Woolf.         The Hadrian novel was widely considered Miss Yourcenar's magnum opus. The author Stephen Koch wrote in The Times Book Review in September 1985 that the work ''has riches for anyone interested in history, humanism or the psychology of power.'' When it was first published, he recalled, ''it was immediately incrusted with the mixed and marmoreal honor of being called a classic in its own time.''         Miss Yourcenar's criticism was praised by John Gross in The Times. Reviewing the English translation of her book ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi and Other Essays,'' Mr. Gross called her ''an outstanding critic'' and said the essays in the book were notably lucid and ''forceful, deeply pondered, the record of a full imaginative response.''         The rest of her work, which drew on her familiarity with several languages and literatures, remained less widely known until she was named to the Academie Francaise. In subsequent years, translations of her writing came out more frequently. Translations Are Published         In April, ''Two Lives and a Dream,'' a volume containing three stories by Miss Yourcenar, was published in an English translation by Walter Kaiser in collaboraton with the author.         The book had come out in 1982 in France, and the stories it contained were revisions of writing Miss Yourcenar did decades earlier. Farrar Straus & Giroux is to publish a paperback edition in April.         ''Mishima: a Vision of the Void,'' a short study by Miss Yourcenar of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, was published here in 1986.         Farrar Straus is also scheduled to publish a collection of essays and literary criticism next spring titled ''That Mighty Sculptor, Time.'' In addition, Farrar Straus is to publish three volumes of autobiography by Ms. Yourcenar, but no publication dates have been set.         The other books by Miss Yourcenar that have appeared in the United States in English translation include, in addition to ''Memoirs of Hadrian,'' ''Coup de Grace'' (1957), ''The Abyss'' (1976), ''Fires'' (1981), ''A Coin in Nine Hands'' (1982), ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi'' (1984), ''Alexis'' (1984) and ''Oriental Tales'' (1985). Read Racine at 8         Miss Yourcenar was born June 8, 1903, the only child of Michel de Crayencour and the former Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne. The name Yourcenar - which she assumed personally and professionally in the 1920's - is an imperfect anagram of the name Crayencour.         Her mother died when Marguerite was less than a month old, and she was educated, largely by tutors, under the direction of her father. As an 8-year-old, she was already reading the work of the 17th-century French dramatist Racine, and as a teen-ager she had two small books of verse published.         Then, as an independently wealthy young woman, she traveled widely, wrote essays, poems and fiction, and won praise as a novelist. In 1950, after settling in the United States, Miss Yourcenar and her American friend and companion, Grace Frick, bought the house in Northeast Harbor - on Mount Desert Island off the Maine coast -that became their longtime home. Miss Frick, who translated ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' and other works by Miss Yourcenar into English, died in 1979.         Miss Yourcenar was known to have prepared a tombstone for her eventual grave, complete up to the final two digits of the date of her death. In the interview with Normal, Miss Yourcenar said she had met a Frenchwoman who was horrified that she had even put the first two numbers of her death date on the marker. ''So she said 'but why should you not live to the year 2000?' I have absolutely no desire to live till the year 2000,'' Miss Yourcenar said. ''The year 2000 is not for me.''         Miss Yourcenar was awarded honorary degrees by Smith, Bowdoin and Colby colleges. She also won numerous European literary prizes, was decorated by the French and Belgian Governments and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the Academy of the French Language and Literature of Belgium.         There are no known survivors.

Sylvia Lewis, former director of the 92d Street Y Nursery School, died Friday after a long illness at her home in Manhattan. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Lewis was director of the nursery school from 1968 until her retirement in 1975. She played a major role in developing the school's preschool education program, which emphasized Jewish culture.         Before becoming director of the school, Mrs. Lewis had taught there for more than 10 years.         ''She was unbelievably gifted in every way,'' said Emily Rosenthal, who directed the school from 1946 to 1966, ''The children loved her.''         Born in Manhattan in 1906, Mrs. Lewis married Kassel Lewis in 1925. She was graduated in 1927 from Barnard College, where she studied English.         Mrs. Lewis is survived by her son, Anthony Lewis, a columnist of The New York Times, a sister, Frieda Berg of the Riverdale section of the Bronx, and nine grandchildren.

        Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The diversity of Mrs. Barr's talents and the force of her personality made her a presence in the New York art world for half a century.         She was the author of ''Medardo Rosso (1858-1928),'' a monograph on the Italian modernist sculptor that was published by the Museum of Modern Art in 1963.         She taught art history for 37 years at the Spence School, where she inspired many future scholars, including Joan R. Mertens, curator of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum.         Mrs. Barr was fluent in French, Italian, Spanish and German and was crucially involved in her husband's curatorial activities and in the wartime effort to provide refuge in the United States for European artists. 'An Essential Partner'         ''Marga was a remarkable person who was an essential partner in the achievements and legacy of Alfred Barr,'' said Richard E. Oldenburg, the director of the Modern. ''A gifted art historian with a fine sense of quality, she was also very intelligent, strong-willed and intensely honest about everything and everyone, including herself.''         ''The book on Rosso is still the best work on him in English,'' said Hilton Kramer, the editor of The New Criterion, whose issue last summer, ''Our Campaigns,'' was devoted to Mrs. Barr's biographical chronicle of the years 1930 to 1944, the turbulent period when Mr. Barr helped shape the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Barr died in 1981 at the age of 79.         ''She was a very gifted linguist, and Alfred was not,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''So all of his dealings with Picasso, Matisse, Miro and virtually all non-English-speaking European artists were done with her as the interpreter. Neither of his two most important books, on Picasso and Matisse, could have been possible without her.''         Mr. Barr's monograph ''Picasso: Fifty Years of His Art,'' published in 1946, was dedicated to her.         ''I grew up in awe of Alfred and Margaret,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose father, Rene d'Harnoncourt, was director of the Museum of Modern Art from 1949 to 1968. ''I think the remarkable thing about Margaret was her emphasis. She made everyone else, including me, feel fuzzy and vague. She had a real gift for drawing your attention and not letting it go.'' Born in Rome         Margaret Scolari was born in Rome in 1901. Her mother, Mary Fitzmaurice, was Irish. Her father, Virgilio Scolari, was an Italian antiques dealer. At the University of Rome from 1919 to 1922, she specialized in humanistic and linguistic studies.         She came to the United States in 1925 and taught Italian at Vassar, from which she also received a master's degree in art history.         In September 1929 she moved to New York City, where she studied art history at New York University. Late in the year, at the inaugural exhibition of the Museum of Modern Art, she met Alfred Barr.         They were married in Paris in 1930. In a profile on Alfred Barr in The New Yorker in 1953, Dwight Macdonald wrote: ''The day after the wedding, Barr started out to borrow pictures for a forthcoming Corot-Daumier show, with Mrs. Barr acting as his translator and secretary. They continued the arrangement through the thirties, going abroad almost every summer to beg and borrow pictures for the next year's exhibitions.''         During World War II, Mrs. Barr was involved in the Emergency Rescue Committee (now the International Rescue Committee), which was responsible for helping artists like Jacques Lipchitz, Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Andre Masson to leave Europe. Translations and Chronology         Mrs. Barr translated Charles Rufus Morey's catalogue of the Vatican Library's Museo Christiano into Italian. She also made the first complete English translation of Matisse's ''Notes of a Painter.''         At the time of her death she was working on the chronology of her life with her husband.         In the introduction to her art history course at Spence, where she taught from 1943 to 1980, Mrs. Barr wrote:         ''I spend no time defining what is art, you'll soon know. Not all of it is, at first sight, beautiful; little of it is pretty; all of it is interesting. And the more you know about a work of art - what preceded it, what followed it, the reasons why it is the way it is - the more it will come to life for you. The tourist who goes through museums exclaiming, 'Beautiful, Beautiful,' is something to be deplored. You jolly well must know why.         ''Now plan to enjoy yourselves. As Poussin, the great French painter of the 17th century, remarked, 'Le fin de l'art est la delectation,' '' - ''The goal of art is delight.''         Mrs. Barr is survived by a daughter, Victoria, a painter who lives in New York City.         A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. on Jan. 12 at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, 921 Madison Avenue, at 73d Street.

She edited the Hadassah newsletter (now a magazine) and, from 1943 to 1946 was editor of the monthly bulletin of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Council of New York. A former resident of Manhattan, she retired to Amherst in 1976, where she taught courses in the Bible and modern Jewish thought, sponsored by the Judaic Studies department of the University of Massachusetts.

Harriette Ann Gray, a dance educator, choreographer and dancer, died in Columbia, Mo., on April 20. She was 73 years old.         Born in Joplin, Mo., Miss Gray trained with Bertie Kirtley. Her career as a dancer began in 1936 when she joined the Humphrey-Weidman Dance Company and became a leading dancer and partner to Jose Limon. She was also assistant to Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman, the company's directors. Miss Gray worked in Hollywood from 1941 to 1951, serving as assistant to Jack Cole at Columbia Studios, teaching movement to young actresses at Universal Studios, and dancing in films produced by Columbia, United Artists and Warner Brothers.         While in Hollywood, Miss Gray also helped form the New Studio for Dancers and Actors and taught dance at private and university studios.

        Cynthia Auerbach, an opera director who was associated with the New York City Opera for 15 years, died Thursday night at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 44 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer.         Cynthia Auerbach, an opera director who was associated with the New York City Opera for 15 years, died Thursday night at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 44 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer.         Educated as a pianist and music theorist, Ms. Auerbach began her stage career at the Manhattan School of Music, where she at first taught music theory and then founded the school's children's opera program in 1969. She had a free-lance career as a director but also held permanent posts at the Chautauqua Opera as artistic director and at the City Opera, where she had been a full member of the directing staff since 1975.         Ms. Auerbach's last directing job was at the American Opera Center at the Juilliard School last February - in a production of Britten's ''Albert Herring.'' At the time, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times of Ms. Auerbach's ''tightly coordinated'' staging and congratulated her for ''shrewdly resisting temptations to let low comedy take over.''         At the City Opera, Ms. Auerbach presided over such revivals as ''Carmen,'' ''The Daughter of the Regiment'' and ''L'Heure Espagnol.'' She also directed the company's new production of ''Les Pecheurs de Perles'' in 1980, which was revived last season. 'American-Made Talent'         Beverly Sills, general director of the City Opera, yesterday described Ms. Auerbach as ''typical of young American-made talent - the kind which has made this country's artists the most versatile in the world. She was feisty and imaginative and so part of our family that she represents a terrible loss.''         Elizabeth Crittenden, her manager at Columbia Artists, remembers Ms. Auerbach as a champion of developing American artists and composers, citing especially her work with young singers at the Texas Opera and at Juilliard and her productions of Carlisle Floyd's ''Of Mice and Men'' and Marc Blitzstein's ''Regina'' at Chautauqua. Ms. Auerbach also directed opera at a score of regional companies in North America, many of them in the American South.         She was born in New York City and received her education at the Juilliard School, the State University of New York at Potsdam and the Manhattan School.         Ms. Auerbach is survived by her father, Percy, now living in Florida, and by two sisters, Ronnie and Lynn, of the New York area. There will be a 2 P.M. service on Sunday at the Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, at 91st Street, in Manhattan.

She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Rachel Eytan Fishman, a novelist and professor of Israeli and Yiddish literature at Hofstra University, died of a stroke Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fishman was born in Palestine. She spent part of her childhood in orphanages and on a kibbutz. She taught school for four years, working closely with the children of new immigrants.         In 1962, Mrs. Fishman wrote ''The Fifth Heaven,'' a novel based on her childhood. It became a best seller in Israel and earned her the Brenner Prize, the highest literary prize in Israel. The book is now included in high school curriculums in Israel.         In 1968, she married Jerry Fishman, a chemist for the Rockefeller Institute, and moved to New York. Two years later, she became an adjunct professor at Hofstra University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Yonatan, of Manhattan and Omri Eytan, of Tel Aviv, and a daughter, Tula, also of Tel Aviv.

        Carmelita Maracci, a leading American ballet teacher and noted performer, died at her home in Hollywood on July 26 after a long illness. She was 75 years old.         Carmelita Maracci, a leading American ballet teacher and noted performer, died at her home in Hollywood on July 26 after a long illness. She was 75 years old.         Miss Maracci was the chief teacher of Cynthia Gregory, a principal dancer at American Ballet Theater. Other pupils, in a teaching career that spanned some 50 years, included Leslie Caron, Geraldine and Charles Chaplin, Erik Bruhn, Jerome Robbins, Agnes de Mille, Donald Saddler, Gerald Arpino and Christine Sarry. But Miss Maracci was even better known as ''one of the major dance figures of our time,'' in the words of Walter Terry, the dance writer, until several career setbacks in the late 1940's and early 50's led Miss Maracci to devote herself to the teaching she had begun in the mid-1930's.         Official biographies state that Miss Maracci was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, but according to her husband, Lee Freeson, Miss Maracci was born in Goldfield, Nev. Her principal dance studies were in ballet, with Luigi Albertieri and Enrico Zanfretta, and Spanish dance, with Hyppolito Mora. After performing with a touring group directed by Alexis Kosloff, Miss Maracci began to experiment with choreography that was a blend of ballet and Spanish dance techniques. Spanish and Ballet Styles         She made her debut in her own work in 1930 in Los Angeles, with a New York debut in 1937. She toured the United States with her own performing group and a repertory of her own dances. Some of her touring was done under the aegis of Sol Hurok, but she broke with him in 1946. The mixed reception accorded her ''Circo de Espana,'' a suite of dances created for Ballet Theater in 1951, was a further blow that led her to devote herself exclusively to teaching.         ''Here is a mistress of ballet technique and style who never dances ballet, of Spanish dance who never does Spanish dances,'' John Martin, a dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1946. ''Both styles are merely materials out of which she fashions an art that is altogether personal, purely subjective in its creative approach, and utterly unique.''         Ms. Gregory has recalled class with Miss Maracci teaching ''on pointe and wearing pink tights, puffing on a cigarette, flicking it out the window and dashing off a fast, furious set of pirouettes.'' Though afflicted with arthritis, Miss Maracci taught in studios throughout Hollywood until 1985. ''She was a person who believed in context and motivation,'' Donna Perlmutter, a West Coast dance writer and longtime student with Miss Maracci, said yesterday. ''Every class of hers was really a performance. She lived in a world of people who came to sit at her feet -and stand at the barre but be imaginative.''         Passionately opinionated, Miss Maracci taught classes with a Socratic tinge, including talk of politics and the other arts of the time. She continued teaching during her last illness by gathering students around her bedside to talk with them of the art of ballet.         Miss Maracci is survived by her husband.

Miss Swoboda, who habitually refused to disclose her age, was believed to be 86.         She taught at some of the leading ballet studios in New York, among them the schools of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, American Ballet Theater, the June Taylor School and the Igor Youskevitch studio. Her pupils included Gertrude Tyven, Norma Vance, Meredith Baylis, Perry Brunson, Roni Mahler and Andrea Vodehnal.         Born Maria Yurieva in St. Petersburg, Miss Swoboda studied dance with Lydia Nelidova in Moscow and entered the Bolshoi Ballet at 15. She was the first dancer taken into the Bolshoi company who trained with private teachers. She left Russia in 1917 and toured Europe with a dance company organized by her and her husband, Vecheslav Swoboda, formerly a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet and now dead.         The two came to the United States as lead dancers with the Chicago Civic Opera Ballet and toured the country several times. The Swobodas opened their own studio in New York in 1937. Miss Swoboda kept the school open after her husband died until 1954, when it became the company school of the Ballet Russe. Miss Swoboda was also married to Nicholas Nedbal.         Miss Swoboda lived in Lakewood, N.J. She taught at her own ballet schools in Asbury Park and Spring Lake and had conducted classes as a guest teacher at ballet companies around the country.

        Minna Harkavy, a sculptor whose works are in the permanent collections of several major museums, died Sunday in the Bronx. She was 101 years old.         Minna Harkavy, a sculptor whose works are in the permanent collections of several major museums, died Sunday in the Bronx. She was 101 years old.         Miss Harkavy was born in Estonia, and emigrated with her family to the United States around 1900. With the exception of the 1920's and early 30's, when she joined the many expatriate American artists living in Paris, she was a resident of New York City for most of her life.         Many of her often oversized sculptures of heads or figures in stone, bronze and clay reflected her social and political concerns. One of her best-known creations, ''The Miners,'' is owned by the Museum of Modern Art. Her works were exhibited widely in the United States and Europe between the 1930's and 1960's, and several of her pieces are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.         Her works were featured in a recent show at New York's ACA Gallery, commemorating the now-defunct New York Society of Women Artists. Miss Harkavy was among the founders of the group, which was devoted to avant-garde women artists. She also taught sculpture for many years in her penthouse studio at the Ansonia Hotel, and did many commissioned busts.         Ms. Harkavy had no survivors.       
        Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Chute, who was born in Minneapolis in 1913, published her first story in 1931. She wrote many stories for and about adolescent boys for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines during the 1930's, and her first book, ''Blocking Back,'' was published in 1938. Many of her early works, such as ''Shattuck Cadet'' (1940) and ''Camp Hero'' (1942), were realistic tales of sports and camp life that captured the relationships and slang of her primarily male teen-age heroes.         Although she continued to write short stories for children and adolescents in the 1940's, Miss Chute began to concentrate on adult fiction with ''The Fields Are White,'' a 1950 book about marriage and manners.         Her best-known novel, ''Greenwillow'' (1956), was described by a critic as ''a deeply moving, gently humorous and serenely wise'' story of young love and self-discovery. It was made into a Broadway musical in 1960. Subsequent works included a 1957 anthology called ''The Blue Cup and Other Stories,'' ''The Story of a Small Life'' (1971) and ''Katie: An Impertinent Fairy Tale'' (1978). Taught at Barnard         Her most recent novel, ''The Good Woman'' (1986), was a parable about a lonely woman who abandons her home for a journey of spiritual awakening while living on the streets.         Miss Chute - who preferred to be called Joy and signed her books B. J. Chute - moved to New York in the early 1940's with her mother and two sisters. Over the years, she did volunteer work with poor children and the Police Athletic League. She became an adjunct professor of English at Barnard College in 1964, and taught creative writing there until her death.         She was also director of Books Across the Sea, a division of the English-Speaking Union that promoted American books overseas, and was an active member and one-time president of the American chapter of PEN, the writer's association.         Miss Chute is survived by two sisters, Marchette Chute, an author, of Manhattan, and Mary Chute Smith, of Morristown, N.J.         A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue and 53d Street, on Oct. 8 at 5:15 P.M.

        Maxeda vonHesse, a speech teacher whose clients included Nelson A. Rockefeller and Christian A. Herter, died of lymphoma Sept. 22 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Daytona Beach, Fla.         Maxeda vonHesse, a speech teacher whose clients included Nelson A. Rockefeller and Christian A.

She carried on the work begun by her mother, Elisabeth Ferguson vonHesse, who died in 1963, coaching actors, politicians, business executives and others.         Miss vonHesse said speech lessons were more than exercises in diction and she worked with a student's ''total personality,'' including gestures, stance, timing, walk and delivery.         Miss vonHesse taught Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Herter during their respective campaigns for governor of New York and governor of Massachusetts.         She was born in Denver and graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. She contended she never needed speech lessons because she came from ''a long line of preachers and teachers, who taught us early to appreciate the power of words.''         There are no immediate survivors.

She was 81 years old.         The hospital spokesman said she died of natural causes, but did not give a cause of death.         A friend and neighbor of Miss Carroll, Countess Maria Larisch, said that the actress had been released from the Hospital Clinic a few days ago after spending more than two weeks there. Other members of the Marbella foreign community said that Miss Carroll, who became a United States citizen in 1943, had lived in the Mediterranean coast town for more than 15 years.         The actress, whose real name was Marie-Madeleine Bernadette O'Carroll, was born on Feb. 26, 1906, in West Bromwich, an industrial community five miles northwest of Birmingham, England. She was the daughter of John Carroll of Ireland and Helene de Rosiere Tuaillon, a Frenchwoman.

After the war she resumed her film career briefly, appearing in ''White Cradle Inn'' (1946), ''An Innocent Affair'' - also entitled ''Don't Trust Your Husband'' (1948), and ''The Fan'' (1949) before retiring from film work for good. She later appeared on the stage and on television and worked for Unesco.         During her long career she also acted in radio dramas and on the stage in the United States.
