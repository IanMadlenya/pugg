         Helen Haje, a Washington public relations woman who championed Arab-American interests with such good-natured fervor that she became gadfly and godmother to the Arab-American movement in the United States, died on Monday at a hospital near her home in Washington. She was 74.         Her family said the cause was congestive heart failure.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Mrs. Haje, who grew up in Altoona, Pa., and married a local Lebanese-American businessman, seemed content with her role as an  American housewife and mother.         But when her husband, Albert, died at the age of 33 in the early 1940's, leaving her with three young children, she pulled up stakes, moved to Washington and went to work, first as a secretary for Catholic Charities and later as an independent public relations woman.         Had it not been for the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and a resulting wave of  Arab stereotypes that swept the United States, Mrs. Haje might have remained a conventional public relations woman, representing commercial and other clients.         In a land of immigrants where ethnic and national societies abound, there had been virtually no Arab-American organizations in the United States, but in the wake of the 1967 war, many prominent Arab-Americans saw the need for a concerted effort both to counter the demonizing stereotypes and to lobby for policies favorable to their often-embattled homelands.         Through her long work with the Saints Peter and Paul Antiochian Orthodox Church in Bethesda, Md., Mrs. Haje had gotten to know and impress many of Washington's leading Arab-American figures, and in 1972 when a group of them formed the National Association of Arab-Americans as the first political Arab-American organization, Mrs. Haje suddenly found herself in the forefront of a movement.         Volunteering to become the group's first executive secretary, she operated the organization for its first few years, first from her home and later at a small office.         Although it was her typing skills that most benefited the organization in its formative stages, the association's founders, many of them unfamiliar with the ways of Washington, soon found her public relations expertise even more valuable.         Over the next years, Mrs. Hafe, a gregarious woman with a wide circle of friends and a bulging file of telephone numbers, continually amazed Arab-American leaders and visiting Arab diplomats with the ease with which she could put them in touch with journalists and newscasters, many of whom were, in turn, equally amazed with the ease with which she could ferret out and secure them interviews with obscure Arab officials or Arab-American scholars, lawyers and business leaders.         Mrs. Haje did not know every one of the estimated three million Arab-Americans in the United States. It just sometimes seemed she did. Although Lebanese-Americans, who account for a third of the total, are the most populous Arab group in the United States, Mrs. Haje recognized and celebrated the common bond among Americans from Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and other Arab counties.         Mrs. Haje, who also served as a bridge between Arab-American organizations, eventually worked so closely with so many of them, including the Arab-American Discrimination Committee and the Arab-American University Graduates Association, that Dr. Clovis Maksud, the Lebanese-born former head of the Arab League, called her the ''mother'' of most of the Arab-American organizations in the United States.         ''At a moment of great despair among Arab-Americans,'' Dr. Maksud said yesterday, ''she helped mobilize and organize the community.''         For all her devotion to her ancestral home in Lebanon and to other Arab countries, Mrs. Haje was a thoroughgoing American who emphasized the need for Arab-American leaders to criticize their homelands' governments when their actions warranted it.         Her survivors include two sons, Charles, of Destin, Fla., and Albert Jr., of Washington; a daughter, Sharyn Corry of Middleburg, Va.; two sisters, four brothers and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Forbes Young, who founded the International Peace Academy, an organization that trains negotiators, diplomats and military personnel in peacekeeping and provides meeting grounds for diplomats involved in efforts to prevent hostilities, died on March 5 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 94.         Mrs. Young's interest in peace started with the dropping of the atomic bomb in 1945. She first joined the World Federalists, a group that worked to influence governments toward peace, but came to believe that an organization that directly involved private citizens would be more effective.         ''When the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, I realized that something enormous had happened, something that had never happened before and that people should take responsibility about what to do about it, for the world would be a really different place from now on,'' she said in a videotaped history of the academy, which is based in Manhattan. ''U Thant was Secretary General of the United Nations at the time. So I asked for a meeting with him. He responded and met me and sat on a bench with me outside. I told him my ideas that an international peace academy could be really useful, but I did not know the right people to start such a thing and how would you suggest I go about it.''         U Thant recommended that she enlist the aid of Maj. Gen. Indar Jit Rikhye, who had been military adviser to U Thant and Dag Hammarskjold. After helping establish the academy in 1970, General Rikhye became its first president, holding that position for 20 years. Mrs. Young provided the start-up money for the organization and, together with several foundations, continued to contribute to its financing.         The academy consists of a few specialists who prepare training models in conflict avoidance, mediation, negotiation, maintaining cease-fires and armistice agreements, negotiation and peacekeeping. There were also off-the-record meetings that brought together United Nations representatives, government officials and an assortment of specialists.         More recently, the group sponsored informal monthly breakfast meetings, also off the record, for such participants and led by Olara Otunnu, the current president, and Rita Hauser, chairwoman of the board.         ''The academy has helped in the career development of hundreds of diplomats and military commanders,'' General Rikhye said from his home in Charlottesville, Va. ''Its pioneering efforts in training future peacekeepers and trainers have had a global impact.''         Mrs. Young was born into a family of diplomats in Milton, Mass., the daughter of Ralph Emerson Forbes and Elise Cabot and a great-granddaughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Her uncle Cameron Forbes was the first Governor-General of the Philippines and often entertained government and military officials, including President William Howard Taft and Gen. John J. Pershing.         In the mid-1920's, she married George Lyman Paine Jr., an architect in New York City. They divorced in the 1930's. Two sons, Michael Paine of Harvard, Mass., and Cameron Paine of Tylersport, Pa., and two grandchildren survive.         In the early 40's she married Dr. Giles Thomas, a psychologist in Manhattan, who died several years later. Her third marriage, to Arthur M. Young, who built the first helicopter to be certified for commercial use, was in 1948.         The couple set up the Institute for the Study of Consciousness in Berkeley in 1972, believing that the world had become too focused on material objects and needed a new spiritual and moral order. Mr. Young died in 1995.       
         Hilda Ginsburg Schwartz, a retired justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who was a mentor and role model for many female lawyers, died on March 18 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         She was among the first women to reach the New York bench at any level and was a judge for 24 years after a stint as the city's Director of Finance. She served on the city's Magistrates Court and Civil Court and she retired from the State Supreme Court in 1983 at 76.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from New York University and, in 1929, from its law school. She joined 9 other women in 1934 to found what is now the 2,000-member Women's Bar Association of the State of New York, and served as its president.         Mayor William O'Dwyer appointed her secretary of the New York City Board of Estimate in 1946, and his successor, Vincent R. Impellitteri, put her on the Magistrates Court in 1951. She served until 1958, when Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her city treasurer.         In 1962, she became the city's first Director of Finance. In 1965, Mayor Wagner made her a Civil Court judge and she won election to a 10-year term the next year. She was elected a State Supreme Court justice in 1971.         During her tenure as Director of Finance, she created an important indicator of the city's economic health, the New York City Excise Tax Guide, as a resource for businesses, lawyers and individual taxpayers, as well as for the city administration. It compiled data, regulations, laws and source materials culled from the city's excise taxes.         Her husband of 52 years, Herman N. Schwartz, died in 1982.         She is survived by a son, John M., and a sister, Edith Smolen, both of Manhattan.       
         P. W. Manchester, a Britain-born critic with wide-ranging interests who edited important dance magazines in London and New York, co-edited a dance encyclopedia and taught dance history, died on Monday at Deaconess Hospital in Cincinnati. She was 91 and lived in Clifton, Ohio.         The cause was complications of a stroke, said Janet Light, a friend.         Miss Manchester disliked and never used her given name, Phyllis Winifred. She signed her reviews with her first initials and was known to friends and colleagues as Bill. Dance was her passion and she witnessed the final days of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the birth of the company that became the Royal Ballet and the formative years of the New York City Ballet.         She could also speak authoritatively on subjects like world literature, the British royal family and baseball, a sport she became devoted to after moving to New York in 1951. She even occasionally served as a radio sports commentator in Cincinnati, discussing baseball games in a refined British accent.         Miss Manchester came to the United States to work as associate editor and principal critic for Dance News, a monthly magazine, and, with its founder, Anatole Chujoy, co-edited  The Dance Encyclopedia, published in 1967. She also wrote dance criticism for The Christian Science Monitor during the 1960's.         Miss Manchester was born in London and worked there as a dance critic for Theater World magazine from 1941 to 1943.         She attracted widespread attention in 1942 with ''Vic-Wells: A Ballet Progress,'' a book appraising the company now known as the Royal Ballet. The work was considered so shrewd that Miss Manchester was often asked if she had personal connections to the company's staff. But at the time, she had none. That same year, however, she became directly involved with another troupe by serving as secretary to Marie Rambert, director of the Ballet Rambert.         Miss Manchester resigned in 1946 to found a monthly magazine called Ballet Today. Its success and her succinct prose led Mr. Chujoy to invite her to Dance News. When Mr. Chujoy died in 1969, he willed her his magazine. But she decided to sell it and accept an offer to teach at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, remaining there until she retired in 1993.         She also taught at the University of Utah and the North Carolina School of the Arts and was an adjudicator, arranging programs for regional ballet festivals.         Miss Manchester took an active part in Cincinnati civic life and for several years was host of a weekly radio dance program there. In 1975, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts enabled her to prepare a series of radio programs on dance history. She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1988.         She is survived by nieces and nephews in Britain and the United States.       
         Betsy Carden, a former dance teacher at Brooklyn College and a leader in American college dance, died on May 5 at her home in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said her family.         Born in Danville, Va., and educated at Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia and at New York University, Ms. Carden taught at Radford College in Virginia before coming to Brooklyn College in 1955. She was head of the Brooklyn College dance department when she retired in 1986.         Believing that colleges need to foster dance as a performing art, she was active in the American College Dance Festival Association from 1979 to 1990. She originated its scholarship program, helped develop its choreography series and supervised many college dance festivals. At her retirement from the association, she was its first executive secretary. She also was president of the American Dance Guild, 1973-75.         She is survived by her husband, John, of Chapel Hill; two sisters, Ardelle Morgan Carter of Lake Wales, Fla., and Mary Jane Martin Bright of Kinston, N.C., and five brothers, W. Ray Martin of Tucson, Ariz., and James T. Morgan, George G. Martin Jr., Robert H. Martin and M. Gene Martin, all of Danville, Va.       
         Beatrice Snyder, a co-founder and former executive of Biocraft Laboratories, a maker of generic pharmaceuticals, died June 21 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.         The cause of death was complications from emphysema, said Harold Snyder, her husband.         The Snyders started Biocraft Laboratories, which specialized in generic antibiotics, in Fair Lawn, N.J., in 1964. Ms. Snyder, who headed the financial operations of the company and was responsible for developing the inventory system, held the titles of senior vice president and secretary. Mr. Snyder was chairman and chief executive. Eventually, all three of the couple's children worked in the company.         Biocraft, which Mr. Snyder said became the first generic pharmaceutical company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1985, had annual sales of $150 million when it was bought by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1996. Ms. Snyder was elected to the Teva board.         Ms. Snyder graduated from Hunter College in 1945 with a bachelor's degree in statistics.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Beryl Snyder Trost, and two sons, Brian and Jay, all of New York, and five grandchildren.       
         Erika Cheetham, an English medieval scholar who made a fortune translating the predictions of the 16th-century physician and astrologer Nostradamus, who gazed not only at the stars but also, legend had it, into a brass bowl of water to see visions of the future, died on May 3 in London. She was 58.         Her books, ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' ''The Further Prophecies of Nostradamus'' and ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' in which she claimed to have found predictions of the execution of  Charles I, the Great Fire of London, the Apollo 13 catastrophe and the spread of AIDS, sold in the millions.         They were on mass-market paperback best-seller lists for years in the United States, Britain and other countries, and, since the first book appeared in 1973, they have never been out of print.         Her good fortune came about because of a mistake at the Taylorian Library at Oxford, where she was working toward a doctorate in medieval languages. The librarian gave her the wrong book, the ''Propheties de M. Nostradamus.'' She found it fascinating and saw in it what she interpreted to be a prediction of World War II.         Michel de Notredame, the astrologer's real name, was also a traveling doctor from Provence, doing what was regarded as heroic work during plagues in Aix-en-Provence and Lyons. He produced several almanacs and a book of rhymed prophecies called ''Centuries,'' which has stayed in print through 300 editions. Before  his death in 1566, he had gained a wide following.         In the 33d quatrain of his fifth set of predictions, for example, a passage on the city of Nantes read: ''The city's leaders in revolt, will in the name of liberty, slaughter its inhabitants without regard to age or sex. There will be screams and howls and piteous sights.'' Two centuries later this was interpreted as a prophecy of the drownings of Nantes under the Committee of Public Safety in 1793.         But being a closet Lutheran in a time of the Inquisitions held to punish heretics, most of Nostradamus's prophesies were cryptic and written in a mix of archaic French, Latin, Greek, Italian or English. Translators contended that the quatrains contained codes, anagrams, hints and fragments of meaning that, put together, were predictions of coming events. A reference to a figure named Hister was taken as code for Hitler.         Erika McMahon-Turner was born in London on July 7, 1939, a daughter of wealthy parents, Eric A. Turner, Under Secretary to the Admiralty, and Helen Lilian McMahon Turner.  She attended a convent school but was expelled for writing an essay contending that God did not exist. She had an interest even then in the paranormal and the prophetic. Later, on gaining acceptance to St. Anne's College, Oxford, she cut a stylish, aristocratic figure, someone who went riding with the Aga Khan and married a Grenadier Guard, James Nicholas Milne Cheetham.         After receiving her Ph.D. she became a staff writer for The London Daily Mail. She wrote an article on Nostradamus in 1961 and two years later began translating his work in earnest.         Her first book appeared in 1965 and became an immediate hit, as did the other two. Her publishers at Corgi Books were now excited about Nostradamus as well. ''A very profitable business to be in,'' one was quoted as saying. ''Every publisher should have a Nostradamus title on their lists. And the beauty of it is that if you get one of Nostradamus's predictions wrong, you can always remove it from the next edition.''         Indeed, at the start of the 1990's at least 10 Nostradamus titles were in print, and with the advent of the Persian Gulf war, bookstores in Britain and the United States were selling out, with total sales tripling in some cases.         Ms. Cheetham, however, was ambivalent about the perspicacity of her hero. Claiming to be a linguist, a scholar and a skeptic, she once said: ''It's all rubbish, you know. Some of it is so vague and tortured and you could bend all sorts of events to fit.''         At other times she projected conviction: ''It's a question of all the portents coming together,'' she said in 1985, ''a pope with two attempts on his life, two brothers assassinated in the U.S.A. and the advent of Halley's comet.''         In her periods of skepticism, she was not alone. ''In a respectable London bookshop last week,'' wrote Francis Wheen in The Guardian in 1996, ''I was astonished to find an entire section given over to works by or about Nostradamus, the mumbo-jumbo merchant.'' The likely explanation, he said, was superstition linked to the approach of the year 2000.         Other nonbelievers in the more distant past included the Catholic Church, which in 1781 put ''Centuries'' on its index of condemned books.         Ms. Cheetham also wrote the screenplay of the 1982 film ''The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which Orson Welles played Nostradamus, and she was a contributor to periodicals and encyclopedias.         She was divorced in 1980, and is survived by a son, Alexander M. Cheetham.       
         Shirley Polykoff, the pioneering advertising woman who came up with a single double-entendre that changed the face, or rather turned the heads, of American society, died on Thursday at her home on Park Avenue. She was 90 and the author of the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' slogan, which unleashed American women to choose the color of their hair.         In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as the mid-1950's hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.         Then in 1956 Miss Polykoff invented the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign for a tiny Bristol-Myers division known as Clairol. Almost overnight, the slogan became a national catch phrase, and dyed hair (although never thereafter, she made sure, known that way) went from declasse to de rigueur.         Attracted by the slogan and its reassuring tag line, ''Hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure,'' within a decade nearly half of all American women were regularly coloring their hair, and sales of dyes, tints and rinses had soared from $25 million to $200 million a year, with Clairol accounting for more than half the total (as it does today with industry sales of more than $1 billion).         Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone & Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.         For the Brooklyn-born middle daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, especially one whose mother wanted her to be a boy, the triumph was hardly a fluke. From the time she was 11 and made ''$3 and change'' for 12 hours' work selling coats in a Brooklyn department store, Miss Polykoff had relished proving herself in the traditional masculine role of breadwinner.         By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone & Belding in time to take over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New York agencies with retail accounts.         As one of the few women in a male-dominated industry selling almost exclusively to women, the traditional household purchasing agents, Miss Polykoff had an advantage over her sometimes obtuse colleagues, particularly those who told her the proposed ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign was too suggestive.         In her 1975 book, ''Does She . . . or Doesn't She? And How She Did It,'' Miss Polykoff recalled that when similarly obtuse executives at Life magazine turned down a 10-page Clairol layout because of the double-entendre, she challenged them to poll the women in the magazine office.         When the dirty-minded executives could not find a single woman who thought the line had any smutty connotation, Miss Polykoff was not surprised. She had realized all along that well brought-up women of the 1950's, the Clairol target audience, would never admit, as she put it, ''that a nice girl ever got an off-color meaning about anything.'' The ad ran, and, as she recalled, ''everybody got rich.''         To some latter-day feminists, Miss Polykoff was somewhat perplexing, on the one hand an obvious pioneering role model for professional women, on the other a woman whose success, which included such campaigns as ''Is It True Blondes Have More Fun?'' and ''If I've Only One Life to Live, Let Me Live It as a Blonde,'' depended on catering to women's vanity as sex objects.         Miss Polykoff, who frankly used her femininity to charm men and who chided modern businesswomen who try to ape men, did not apologize. For all her ambition and outsized success as a woman, Miss Polykoff was cut from a pre-feminist mold, never forgetting, as she often put it, that she was ''a girl first and an advertising woman second.''         Growing up as the awkward middle daughter between two raven-haired beauties, Miss Polykoff, who saw her blond hair as her only physical distinction (at least until she began to develop what she called her ''sexy curves''), was so distraught when her hair began to darken as a teen-ager that she began having a local hairdresser lighten it, just to make the back match the front. That fiction sufficed until her future mother-in-law secretly asked her son the Yiddish foreshadowing of ''Does she  . . . or doesn't she?''         Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000 so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George P. Halperin. After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried employee for many years.         She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio, and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 15, 1998, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Shirley Polykoff, the advertising woman who devised the slogan ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' in 1956 to advertise hair coloring products, referred incorrectly to the ownership of the advertiser, Clairol. The company was independent at the time. It was acquired in 1959 by the Bristol-Myers Company, now Bristol-Myers Squibb.       
         Ruth Snedden Shoup, whose many years in New York public affairs and whose tenure on the city's Board of Higher Education bridged the mayoralties of Fiorello H. La Guardia and John V. Lindsay, died on June 25 at Ledges retirement home in Laconia, N.H. A former resident of Riverdale, the Bronx, she was 94.         Mrs. Shoup was a mainstay of the New York League of Women Voters and a staunch La Guardia supporter when she was sworn in by the Mayor in 1936 to the Board of Higher Education. She gained a reputation as one of the board's most active and outspoken members, quite capable of scolding City Hall when it trespassed on the body's mandate to run the municipal colleges.         By the time she retired from the board in 1970, Mrs. Shoup had been a member or chairwoman of many board committees and a perennial board secretary who had used her positions to play a key role in growing and nurturing the colleges.         When she took office, the city's college chain was already the country's largest system of higher education. It included four colleges: Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens. By the 1950's, their collective enrollment had passed 100,000 and the board had steered their evolution into today's City University of New York.         In 1957, the city opened the first two-year community college on Staten Island and a short time later those in the Bronx and Queens. In 1965, CUNY awarded its first two doctorates at its Graduate Center.         Throughout, Mrs. Shoup was a stalwart in planning, writing budgets and helping to evaluate academic leaders for college presidencies.         A native of Oakland, Calif., she was a graduate of Stanford University.         She is survived by her husband of 73 years, Carl S. Shoup; their daughter, Dale S. Mayer, of Center Sandwich, N.H.; a son, Paul S., of Charlottesville, Va., eight grandchildren  and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Appleton Standen, one of the world's leading authorities on tapestries and a longtime curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died last weekend at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. Standen's writings, which include an award-winning, two-volume catalogue of the Met's European post-medieval tapestries, helped broaden the interest in her speciality, which was one she never set out to have. When the Met's director offered her a curatorial position in charge of its Textile Study Room in 1949, she said yes, but added that he should know three things: she didn't know much about textiles; she cared less than most women about fashion, and she never used a needle and thread unless she had to. The subject took: until a month ago, she was at the Metropolitan every day at 9 A.M., said Thomas Campbell, an associate curator.         She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of a British Army officer, and spent her childhood in Ireland and England. She received an honors degree in English from Somerville College, Oxford University, in 1926, and immigrated to the United States two years later. In Boston, she went to work for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, founded by William Sumner Appleton, her uncle.         She is survived by a sister-in-law, Lisl Standen.         Ms. Standen also did volunteer work for the photo collection of Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. She was invited to take the legendary museum course taught by Paul J. Sachs, the Fogg's associate director. In 1929 she was hired by Joseph Widener as secretary to his art collections. This position lasted until he gave the works to the National Gallery of Art in 1942. With World War II  under way, Ms. Standen became an American citizen and joined the Women's Army Corps, ending up in Ohio working for the Air Force. In 1945, she was sent to Europe as a member of the American Military Government's Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, the group that preserved, restored and returned art plundered during the war to its rightful owners. In early 1946, she took over management of the Weisbaden Collecting Point.         Ms. Standen, who remained single all her life, worked at the Met until 1970, organizing exhibitions and writing and lecturing on textiles and paintings. Besides her 1985 catalogue, ''European Post-Medieval Tapestries and Related Hangings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' she published more than 50 articles.         After her retirement, she remained a consultant to the Met until 1988. In 1986, she began to compile a biennial newsletter about tapestries, which she distributed in the academic world. She had just completed her final article, about Beauvais tapestries, which Mr. Campbell said was to be published posthumously in the Metropolitan Museum Journal. Her archives and books are expected to be left to the Metropolitan.       
         Claire M. Smith, a literary agent and a former president of Harold Ober Associates, a Manhattan literary agency, died on Saturday at her home in South Prospect Park, Brooklyn. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the agency said.         Mrs. Smith, whose clients included Richard Adams, Judy Blume, Dean Koontz and James Herriot, began her career as a secretary at Alfred A. Knopf. In 1959 she joined the Ober agency. Her first success came with ''The Incredible Journey,'' a novel by Sheila Burnford about the travels of two dogs and a cat across the Canadian wilderness. The book has been the basis for three Disney films.         Mrs. Smith is survived by her husband, Robert Kimmel Smith, an author; a daughter, Heidi M. Smith of San Francisco; a son, Roger K. Smith of New York City, and a sister, Harriet M. Levine of Orangeburg, N.Y.       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.       
         Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide operation, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940's and 50's she was married to the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic American self-help book ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after Mr. Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates and $187 million in annual sales.         With her strawberry blond hair, gleaming smile and rich Oklahoma twang -- Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Mr. Carnegie as well as his wife -- she proved as big a success in business as he was in motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950's wondered whether she had what it took to continue Mr. Carnegie's quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took over the operations ''so that I have no time to sit and whittle and spit.''         Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.         In the early 1940's, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called an ''unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course at a Y.M.C.A. in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired for the jump she made from stenographer in the Gulf Oil Corporation's accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite. She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.         Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company offered her a job in New York. She became Mr. Carnegie's secretary in January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later made her his business partner.         Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case histories for a book she wrote, ''How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their husbands were such aphorisms as ''Share his interests and ideals'' and ''Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a wailing wall.''         But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and teaching interests. She once started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of women taking the regular course.         Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune 500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the confidence to present themselves well in public settings. Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.         Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics. So did Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of the Chrysler Corporation.         ''For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his autobiography, ''Iacocca.'' ''But that was before I took a course in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help of Carnegie teachers.         Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late 1960's.         Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa. She retired from active management of the closely held company in 1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she remained chairwoman.         She is survived by Mr. Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier. She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.       
         Minerva Bernardino, a major force behind the founding of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and a pioneer among Latin American feminists, died on Aug. 29 in the Dominican Republic. She was 91.         Ms. Bernardino, who was appointed a representative of the Dominican Republic at the United Nations in 1950, was one of only four women to sign the United Nations Charter in 1945. At the Charter conference in San Francisco, she insisted that the document include the phrase ''to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination against race, sex, condition or creed.''         A contemporary of Eleanor Roosevelt, whose passions for human rights she shared, Ms. Bernardino joined Mrs. Roosevelt and three other women who were delegates to the first United Nations General Assembly in 1946 -- Jean McKenzie of New Zealand, Evdokia Uralova of the Soviet Union and Ellen Wilkinson of Britain -- in writing an ''Open Letter to the Women of the World'' calling on women to take a more active role in politics and government.         She was vice chairman and then chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Women from 1944 to 1949, the first regional body set up to advance the rights of women.         ''Ms. Bernardino spoke up for women in the aftermath of World War II, understanding that life for women would never be the same, '' said Kristen Timothy, deputy director of the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women.         Ms. Bernadino, born in Seibo in the Dominican Republic, was the granddaughter of a provincial governor and one of seven children in a family that was unusually liberal on women's rights.         ''My mother was very progressive and I was reared in an atmosphere that was, at that time, most unusual in my country,'' she once told The Christian Science Monitor in an interview. Her father also encouraged her independence.         When she was orphaned at 15, her lack of inhibitions about women working led her into a career in the civil service. Meanwhile, she was studying for a bachelor of science degree.         By 1929, she was active in the women's rights movement in the Dominican Republic, where she was a leader in Accion Feminista Dominicana, which led the fight for expanded rights in the 1942 Constitution.         In her long life of fighting for women's and children's rights, Ms. Bernardino won many honors. In 1995, she was awarded the Hispanic Heritage Award for excellence in education in Washington. On the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in 1997, she was honored in a speech by Secretary General Kofi Annan, who called the commission ''to an important extent her creation.''         Ms. Bernardino was also known in Latin American for her sustained opposition to strongmen -- she went into what friends described as self-imposed exile to demonstrate her opposition to the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in her own country -- and for her work on international panels dedicated to making the region a zone of peace.       
         Winnie Ruth Judd, who spent three decades in an Arizona state mental hospital as the notorious ''trunk murderess'' in one of the most sensational criminal cases of the 1930's, died in Phoenix on Friday. She was 93.         With the Great Depression at full strength in the fall of 1931 and newspapers vying for stories to take their readers' minds off their miseries, the lurid details of the Judd case proved irresistible. But the case also provoked a debate over capital punishment.         Mrs. Judd, then a 26-year-old secretary at a Phoenix medical clinic and the wife of a doctor, arrived at Union Station in Los Angeles on Oct. 18, 1931, on a train from Phoenix, accompanied by two trunks and several valises. When a baggage man noticed what appeared to be blood dripping from one trunk, he asked her to open it. Mrs. Judd said she did not have the key and left in an automobile driven by her brother, Burton McKinnell. The police were called and traced the car from the license plate.         Inside the larger trunk, detectives found the body of Agnes Anne LeRoi, 32. What they found in the smaller trunk catapulted the case into headline news around the country. It contained remains of Hedvig Samuelson, 24, her body neatly cut into three pieces to make it easier to pack. A few days later, a valise left behind by Mrs. Judd was found to contain a fourth body section.         The two women had been fatally shot the previous Friday night at a Phoenix residence they had previously shared with Mrs. Judd when her husband was out of town.         Four days after the bodies were discovered, Mrs. Judd was arrested in Los Angeles. She quickly became an object of curiosity. When she was returned to Phoenix for trial, thousands lined the streets for a glimpse, and the owner of the home where the murders occurred sold 10-cent tickets for tours.         Mrs. Judd maintained that she shot the women in self-defense when they attacked her during an argument, but prosecutors said that she entered the residence while the two  slept, then shot them in the head out of jealousy over attentions paid to them by her married boyfriend.         Two years later, by then dubbed the ''trunk murderess'' and the ''tiger woman'' in headlines, Mrs. Judd was convicted of murdering Miss LeRoi and was sentenced to hang. Mrs. Judd was not tried for the murder of Miss Samuelson, so the question of who dismembered her body was never formally raised. There was later speculation that a local physician other than husband had performed the expert cutting.         Pressure was brought to spare Mrs. Judd's life in view of her claims of self-defense and her lawyer's assertions that she was mentally ill. Thirty state legislators and a group of 34 ministers and priests signed petitions, and Arizona authorities received several thousand letters on her behalf. Eleanor Roosevelt was among those expressing concern.         Several days before the hanging was to take place, a jury impaneled for a sanity hearing found that Mrs. Judd was then insane, and she was institutionalized. She escaped six times from the Arizona State Hospital for the Insane in Phoenix over the next two decades, maintaining later that a nurse had given her a key to the entrance that she hid in a coin holder and used in some escapes. She was taken back into custody within a short time on each occasion and otherwise proved a model patient, cooking for other patients and helping bathe them.         On Oct. 8, 1962, Mrs. Judd escaped yet again, this time disappearing for almost seven years. She was finally found in the San Francisco area, where, calling herself Marian Lane, she had worked as a housekeeper in a mansion owned by an elderly woman. The noted defense lawyer Melvin Belli took her case and fought unsuccessfully against extradition to Arizona.         Mrs. Judd was judged to be sane by medical examiners in Arizona, was transferred to the state penitentiary in Florence and was freed shortly before Christmas 1971. She returned to California to work for the family that had previously employed her, later lived in Stockton and then went back to Phoenix a few years before her death.         Sixty-seven years after the murders, the crime lives on. An Internet ''sightseeing tour'' of Phoenix has a photo of the site where the murders occurred (it is now a vacant lot between two homes) and advises that an apartment building where Mrs. Judd once lived is the site of a medical center.         A longtime friend, Kenneth Cain of Sun City, Ariz., said yesterday that Mrs. Judd had no immediate survivors.         In a letter she wrote in 1952, Mrs. Judd, an Indiana native and the daughter of a minister, called the dismemberment ''a ghastly deed'' but again maintained that she shot the two women in self-defense. She said that she transported the bodies because she was suffering from shock, but wrote, 'I've asked God many times to forgive me.''       
         Paula Kissinger, a refugee from Nazi Germany who held the Bible at the White House in 1973 when her first-born son, Henry, was sworn in as Secretary of State, the highest Cabinet post in her adopted land, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday in Manhattan. She was 97.         From the time she arrived in America in 1940 with her husband and two young sons until the time she died, Mrs. Kissinger lived in the same apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where  she was well known and well regarded by the once large German-Jewish  emigre community there.         It was Mrs. Kissinger -- the practical one in the family -- who decided that they had to leave Germany when Hitler came to power. Dr. Henry Kissinger told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that his father was reluctant to recognize the growing evil around him. ''My father was lucky he had an earthy wife who made all the decisions,'' he said.  ''She looked after necessities.''         She got in touch with a cousin in New York, and it was soon arranged.  ''It was my decision, and I did it because of the children,'' she told Mr. Isaacson. ''I knew there was not a life to be made for them if we stayed.''         Mrs. Kissinger was born Paula Stern in 1901 into a prosperous middle-class family in Leutershausen. In 1922, she married Louis Kissinger.  He was 35; she was 21. They moved to Furth, where he was a teacher, and within the year their first son, Heinz Alfred, was born. He took the name Henry when the family came to the United States. The next year a second son, Walter Bernhard, arrived. Both sons, as well as six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, survive Mrs. Kissinger.         When she arrived in New York she quickly mastered the language and, to supplement the money earned by her husband and her sons, she became a cook and a caterer in Washington Heights. She refused to leave the neighborhood, even after her husband died 10 years ago and her elder son asked her to move in with him and his wife downtown.         Several years ago, she fell in her kitchen and was unconscious for several hours. She was put on a life-support system, but when doctors wanted to remove it, her son Henry refused. When the doctors explained that she wouldn't be able to think or speak, he replied, ''You don't know my mother.'' After being unconscious for days, she awoke and asked him, ''What day is it?'' When he told her it was Tuesday, she said, ''Cancel my 10 o'clock dentist appointment.''         She returned to Germany a few times, once when Dr. Kissinger was given an honorary degree. She was struck by the unreality of it all.  ''First you get chased away, and then you get treated like royalty,'' she told a reporter. Back home, when her son came to visit, the neighborhood was all excited and she admitted to being proud: ''They say, 'My son the doctor.' What should I say, my son the Aussenminister?' ''       
         Valerie Hobson, a British movie star who stayed loyal to her husband, John Profumo, after he figured in a sex scandal as a member of Britain's Conservative Government in 1963, died on Friday at a London hospital. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, the British news agency Press Association said.         Miss Hobson, a British naval officer's daughter, starred in British films of the 1930's and 1940's. As the movie historian Ephraim Katz has put it, ''she developed into one of the prime leading ladies of the British screen, gentle, graceful and elegant, the personification of the well-bred upper-crust English lady.''         She retired as an actress after starring as the governess, Anna, in the 1953 stage production of the musical ''The King and I'' in London. That role, The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday, was her greatest success, and ''as an actress, she knew, like Garbo, when to quit.''         The British critic W. A. Darlington wrote in The New York Times that in the musical her singing voice ''was true and clear'' and ''besides the great good looks which had taken her on to movies, she proved to have a warm and charming personality.''         Earlier she starred as Estella in David Lean's ''Great Expectations'' (1946), which the critic Leonard Maltin has called ''one of the greatest films ever made, a vivid adaptation of Dickens's tale of a mysterious benefactor making a poor young orphan a gentleman of means.''         Another of her best-remembered film roles was her starring part, with Alec Guinness, in the much-applauded black comedy ''Kind Hearts and Coronets'' (1949).         In 1954 she married Mr. Profumo, a Conservative member of Parliament. He stepped down in disgrace as Secretary of State for War in 1963 after it had become known that he was having an affair with a British call girl, Christine Keeler, who was also involved with a Soviet military attache.         Later Mr. Profumo did much to redeem himself by throwing himself into unpaid charity work. Miss Hobson also did volunteer work, for a leprosy relief organization and for children with mental handicaps. In 1975 she and her husband went to Buckingham Palace, where he was honored for his good works by being made a Commander, Order of the British Empire.         The 1963 scandal became the basis for the 1989 film ''Scandal'' -- which,  the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, ''so abridges and elides the real-life case that it isn't easy for a nonstudent to follow the chronology of events.''         Born in Larne in Northern Ireland, Miss Hobson went on to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She began her performing career on the London stage, acted in some modest British films, then made some Hollywood movies for Universal -- largely forgettable, except for ''The Bride of Frankenstein,'' where she played the baron's wife -- and returned to Britain in the mid-1930's.         Her 1939 marriage to Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan, a baronet who had produced several movies she was in, ended in divorce in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Mark Havelock-Allan and David Profumo.       
         Elisabeth A. Owens, who helped to shape the field of international tax law and in 1972 became the first woman ever granted tenure at Harvard Law School, died on Sunday at Falmouth (Mass.) Hospital. She was 79 and lived in Falmouth.         The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said her niece Charlotte Harris.         Tenure did not come easily for Professor Owens. Former students and faculty colleagues alike say she  was denied it for years because of her sex. Speaking to a reporter for the Harvard Law Bulletin in 1988, another professor at the law school,  Milton Katz, described the granting of tenure for her as ''a delayed justice,'' and Professor Owens herself said at the time, ''It was a decision that I also felt was overdue.''         Asked for comment yesterday, Michael Chmura, a spokesman for the law school, said Harvard did not comment on faculty appointments other than to announce them.         Even after Professor Owens had gained tenure, said Ms. Harris, her niece, she was assigned, condescendingly, to teach women's' studies. After a year of that, she refused to teach the subject and returned to her main interest, international tax law.         Elisabeth Ann Owens was born in Boston and graduated from Boston Girls Latin School and from Smith College, summa cum laude. She received her bachelor of laws degree from Yale Law School in 1951 and subsequently became a research assistant to the tax expert Stanley S. Surrey at Harvard Law School.         After a year in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, she began teaching full time at Harvard. Asked once by a reporter how she had decided to concentrate on tax law, she said: ''I think at one point Professor Surrey asked me, 'What is creditable tax?' My answer turned into three books.''         Professor Owens was the author of ''The Foreign Tax Credit'' (I.T.P., 1961), which Prof. Oliver Oldman of Harvard called ''one of the best tax books ever written.'' Professor Oldman said the beauty of the work was the way it organized ''the law into a structured, reasoned whole.''         Professor Owens was also the author, with Gerald Ball, of the two-volume ''The Indirect Credit'' (I.T.P., 1975 and 1979).         In midcareer, Professor Owens also developed an interest in natural resources law. She retired in 1981.         She is survived by her sisters Margaret Harris, of Falmouth, and Mary Bemis, of Randolph, Mass.; her brothers, Cornelius Owens of West Roxbury, Mass., and Graham Owens of Yarmouth Port, and 15 nieces and nephews, including her nieces Mary Owens and Charlotte Harris, with both of whom she lived in Falmouth.       
         Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the daughter of Gerald and Sara Murphy, the golden couple at the center of the modernist whirl in 1920's Europe, who was dandled on the knees of the towering figures of the avant-garde, died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Palm Beach in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach Shores and East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was liver cancer, said Amanda Vaill, the author of ''Everybody Was So Young: Gerald and Sara Murphy -- A Lost Generation Love Story'' (Houghton Mifflin).         Mrs. Donnelly, the eldest of the Murphys' three children and the only one to reach adulthood, published a biography of her parents, ''Sara & Gerald: Villa America and After'' (Times Books) written with Richard N. Billings, in 1982.         Attractive, cultured and well-to-do (Gerald was heir to the Mark Cross leather goods fortune, Sara the daughter of an industrialist and a grandniece of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman), the Murphys epitomized the urbane insouciance of the jazz age. Although Gerald enjoyed a brief career as a painter -- his small output remains well regarded -- he and his wife were content to occupy backstage roles as bartenders, muses and sometime financial angels to the foremost writers, composers and artists of their age.         In return, the Murphys were memorialized (not always graciously) in the work they supported. They were the inspiration for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ''Tender is the Night''; Sara was the model for Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' and Fitzgerald bestowed the name Honoria on the heroine of his 1931 story ''Babylon Revisited.''         Honoria Adeline Murphy (she pronounced the 'H' in her first name) was born in New York on Dec. 19, 1917. Fair haired and blue eyed, she ''looked like a Renoir and was dressed accordingly,'' in the words of the Murphy biographer Calvin Tomkins.         In 1921, partly to escape the philistinism of American culture, the Murphys sailed for Europe with Honoria and her younger brothers, Baoth and Patrick. In Paris they painted scenery for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which gave them entree to a circle that included Picasso and Jean Cocteau.         In the summer of 1925 the family moved to Antibes, on the Riviera, then an unheard-of destination in warm weather. (The Murphys are credited with starting the Riviera's summer season.) They christened their house Villa America.         At Villa America, they moved in a shimmering bubble that seemed to insulate them from ordinary cares. The late 20's passed there in a charmed blur of jazz and Champagne and beaded dresses, of spats and white flannels and sherry and biscuits on the seashore. A representative guest list: Picasso, Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Archibald MacLeish, Philip Barry, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Cole Porter, Monty Woolley, Igor Stravinsky, Fernand Leger and Ernest and consecutive Mrs. Hemingways.         To Honoria and her brothers, these artistic titans were simply the adored tall people of their enchanted childhood. Hemingway taught her to catch and gut fish. (She got off easy: he once tried to teach her father to bullfight.) The photographs in the family album were by Man Ray. Scrutinizing one of Honoria's drawings hung on the Villa America terrace (nicknamed ''Les Salons de Jeunesse''), Picasso counseled, ''Don't change it.''         As a young woman, she studied French theater history with Mrs. Darius Milhaud and acting with Mrs. Patrick Campbell. She later performed with the French Theater of New York and worked as a secretary for Theater Inc., a producing organization. In recent years, she lectured on the Lost Generation writers and opened her vast archive of family memorabilia to scholars of the period.         In 1929 the real world intruded savagely on the Murphys' idyll when their youngest son, Patrick, was found to have tuberculosis. They returned to the United States, where Honoria attended Rosemary Hall School in Greenwich, Conn., and the Spence School in New York, from which she graduated in 1937.         It was Baoth who died first, in 1935, after contracting spinal meningitis at 15. ''Only the invented part of our life -- the unreal part -- has had any scheme, any beauty,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Fitzgerald. ''Life itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed.''         Two years later Patrick died at 16. Fitzgerald wrote to the Murphys: ''For a long, long time you will be inconsolable. But I can see another generation growing up around Honoria and an eventual peace somewhere.''         A devoted daughter who was ever conscious of her responsibility as the sole surviving child, Honoria fulfilled that prophecy. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she wed William M. Donnelly, a businessman, in 1950. (On their honeymoon, she telephoned her parents every night.) The couple lived in Carmel, Calif., and later in McLean, Va. Mrs. Donnelly, who was widowed in 1988, is survived by their children, John, of Palm Beach Shores; Sherman, of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Laura, of East Hampton, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         ''How different a dawn than the one we saw in a hospital 18 years ago,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Sara after the Donnellys' second son was born. ''Two boys went out from our family, and now two other boys have come into it.''
