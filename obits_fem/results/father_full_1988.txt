        Chaya Moussia Schneerson, the wife of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, died early yesterday at New York Hospital. She was taken to the hospital Tuesday night complaining about feeling ill. She was 86 years old and lived in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.         Chaya Moussia Schneerson, the wife of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, died early yesterday at New York Hospital. She was taken to the hospital Tuesday night complaining about feeling ill. She was 86 years old and lived in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.         Thousands of her husband's followers - dressed in the black garb of the Hasidim - lined the streets for the funeral procession that began outside her home on President Street yesterday afternoon and moved slowly past the headquarters of the Lubavitch movement at 770 Eastern Parkway, near Brooklyn Avenue.         Burial was at the Old Montefiore cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Schneerson, who was known as the Rebbetzin, was born in the Russian city of Lubavitch, the second of three daughters of the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchak Schneerson. She married Menachem Schneerson, her third cousin, in Warsaw in 1928. Together they fled Hitler, living in Paris, Nice and eventually settling in Brooklyn, in 1941.         Upon her father's death in 1950, her husband succeeded him as the Rebbe, or grand rabbi, of Lubavitch, one of the major remaining Hasidic dynasties. In keeping with Hasidic tradition, Mrs. Schneerson never held formal office in the Lubavitch organization, but ''she was very much behind the scenes,'' according to her husband's close aide, Rabbi Yehudah Krinsky.         ''In her quiet behind-the-scenes way, she was involved in every activity of Lubavitch,'' he said.         Surviving are her husband and a sister, Hannah Gourary.       
        Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Best known for her insight into the everyday activities of American women, young and old, and for her studies of life as it was lived in and near Union Square from 1930 until the present day, Miss Bishop was the living continuation of a specific and distinctively American idiom.         That idiom, which was pioneered at the turn of this century by Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, George Luks, John Sloan and others, was reportorial in style, anecdotal in tone and shorn of all extraneous or merely complimentary material. It was intended to seize a moment, tell a tale, and give a renewed dignity to people for whom high art in this country had not often had a place. A Perceptive Observer         On the street corner, in the automat, in the subway and on park benches in fine weather, Miss Bishop proved herself a perceptive observer. For young women in the big city who were as yet unmarked by life, she had a particular feeling. But she was alert to the potential both for happiness and for an irrevocable, untold misery that exists at every stage of metropolitan life.         For all the rapid, spontaneous, firsthand qulity of her observation, she knew how to reach back into European Old Master painting for support and encouragement. John H. Baur, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, once said of her work that ''in some mysterious manner which I do not really understand, her paintings carry forward the great tradition of north European 17th-century figure painting.''         Miss Bishop cherished that connection, and once said that ''you may have true gifts and the ability to make something that is new and surprising, but if your work hasn't any connections and your gift gives out, you haven't any leverage.'' Optimistic Viewpoint         When she first came to New York in the early 1920s, determined to become an artist, Miss Bishop studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois, both of whom had studied with Robert Henri.         From Pene du Bois, and later from her close friend, the painter Reginald Marsh, Miss Bishop learned to sharpen and perfect her sense of a New York subject. But neither age nor familiarity ever eroded her inherently optimistic approach to life. In her late work, it was as apparent as ever she had an unsentimental confidence that one day, somehow, the lot of women in the city would be changed for the better, Miss Bishop was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 3, 1902, the daughter of John Remsen Bishop, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Anna Bartram Bishop. Her father moved his large family from Princeton to the Midwest in hopes of giving them a more comfortable life. The failure of this venture, and the experience of genteel poverty in Detroit, gave her a lifelong sympathy with underprivileged people. Moved to New York in 1918         In 1918 she moved to New York and studied at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. Shortly after leaving the Art Students League in 1924, she began to work in the Union Square area, where she eventually took rank as the unofficial but unquestioned visual historian.         In 1932, she joined the Midtown Gallery in Manhattan, with which she remained closely affiliated for the rest of her life. A member of the National Academy of Design since 1941, she was vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters from 1944-46, a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London in 1964, a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971, and the recipient of honorary doctorates at Bates College, Mount Holyoke College and Syracuse University. She also received the gold medal of the National Arts Club in 1968 and 1970, the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts award (presented by President Carter) in 1979, and the gold medal for painting from the National Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1987.         Miss Bishop was married in 1934 to Dr. Harold Wolff, a neurologist. She is survived by a son, Remsen Wolff, and two granddaughters, Sara and Naomi Wolff.

Olive Carey, an actress and the wife and mother to a pair of famous Harry Careys, died Sunday at her home. She was 92 years old.         Olive Golden was born on Jan. 31, 1896, into a performing family headed by her father, George Fuller Golden, a vaudeville entertainer.         The actress appeared on screen with Harry Carey, her future husband, in the 1914 silent movie ''The Sorrowful Shore.'' She later worked with the director D. W. Griffith and made several films with John Ford, John Wayne, her husband and their son, Harry Carey Jr. When her husband died in 1947, Mrs. Carey came out of retirement to act in such films as ''The Searchers,'' ''The Alamo'' and ''Two Rode Together.''         In addition to her son, she is survived by a sister, Mignonne; a daughter, Cappy Carey; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Bessie Heard, who endowed her hometown of McKinney with a wildlife sanctuary and natural science museum, died Tuesday night, a museum spokesman said Wednesday. She was 101 years old.         Bessie Heard, who endowed her hometown of McKinney with a wildlife sanctuary and natural science museum, died Tuesday night, a museum spokesman said Wednesday. She was 101 years old.         More than 40,000 visitors each year come to the Heard Natural Science Museum and Wildlife Sanctuary, which Miss Heard endowed in 1964. It includes more than five miles of nature trails, said Steve Runnels, the museum's director of development.         Miss Heard was the eldest of five daughters. Her father, John Spencer Heard, spent four years in the Confederate Army and then opened a general store in McKinney, north of Dallas, with his brother.         Survivors include two cousins.       
        Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Miss Somogi's early successes were at the New York City Opera, where she made her 1974 debut in ''The Mikado'' and ''La Traviata,'' thus becoming the company's first female conductor. Yet, the preponderance of her career was centered in Europe. Beginning in 1981, Miss Somogi became first Kapellmeister under Michael Gielen at the Frankfurt Opera and left there only last year with the departure of Mr. Gielen and the dismantling of his organization. Miss Somogi's last appearance was six months ago conducting ''Das Rheingold'' in Frankfurt.         She never returned to the New York stage after moving to West Germany. During her Frankfurt career, she presided over new productions of ''Il Turco in Italia,'' ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' ''Tales of Hoffmann'' and ''Das Rheingold.'' Miss Somogi's American appearances during her European years were confined to productions at the Tulsa Opera. Joined City Opera in '66         She joined the City Opera in 1966 as a rehearsal pianist, spending her summers as assistant conductor to Thomas Schippers at the Spoleto Festival in Italy. There were also purely instrumental conducting appearances with the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics and more opera with various regional companies across the United States.         At the time Miss Somogi was hired in Frankfurt, Mr. Gielen said: ''We took her because she was the best. Our orchestra has some old experienced hands who cannot be taught very much. Within five minutes she had them on the edge of their seats.''         Judith Somogi was born in Brooklyn of a Hungarian father and a Sicilian mother. She said she had gained valuable experience as a church organist and choir director in Lynbrook, L.I., and as a pianist, she went on earn two degrees at Juilliard. ''Conducting,'' Miss Somogi once said, ''is something you learn by doing.''         She is survived by her parents, Louis and Antonina, and by her sister, Jane, all of Lynbrook.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Mystery in Sculpture         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left.         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.

In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's and was shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting people of her time. Known for Wall Sculptures         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev in the Ukraine in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in the Ukraine until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest. A Feeling For Wood         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Mr. Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she married Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich.

Constant Change, Constant Work         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A.

She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters and two great-granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Carolyn Ann Franklin, a singer and songwriter, died of cancer on Monday. She was 43 years old.         Carolyn Ann Franklin, a singer and songwriter, died of cancer on Monday. She was 43 years old.         Among Miss Franklin's compositions were ''Gotta Find Me an Angel'' and ''Ain't No Way,'' both made into million-record sellers by her sister, Aretha.         She also arranged ''Take Another Little Piece of My Heart'' by Erma Franklin, another sister and singer, a song later made popular by Janis Joplin.         Miss Franklin was born in Memphis and moved with her family to Buffalo and then to Detroit in 1946. As a child, she formed a singing group with members of the young people's choir at the New Bethel Baptist Church, where her father was the pastor.         She, Erma and their cousin, Brenda Bryant, sang background on Aretha Franklin's early records.         She is survived by her sisters, her grandmother and two brothers.       
        Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Judge Matthews was named to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by President Truman in 1949. At the time of her nomination, she was a familiar figure in Washington as a lawyer for the National Women's Party and an active campaigner for women's rights.         Judge Matthews presided over a number of major trials, including the 1957 bribery trial of James R. Hoffa, then vice president of the teamsters' union, at which he was acquitted. Help From Friends in Senate         She recalled in an interview several years ago that her friendship with a number of senators had blunted opposition to the notion of a woman on the Federal bench. When her nomination was being considered, one of the judges on the district court, T. Alan Goldsborough, said publicly that while ''Mrs. Matthews would be a good judge,'' there was ''just one thing wrong: she's a woman.''         While Judge Goldsborough told her some years later that his opposition had been mistaken, she received an icy welcome from her fellow judges, who agreed among themselves to assign her all the ''long motions,'' the most technical and least rewarding part of the court's docket.         Judge Matthews never retired from the court. In 1968 she took senior status, permitting her to reduce her workload on the district court while also hearing occasional cases in other Federal courts in Washington. She sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. She continued hearing district court cases until five years ago.         Judge Matthews retained a strong sense of her own role as a pioneer, and never wavered in her commitment to expanding opportunities for women. In a 1985 interview with the Third Branch, a newsletter published by the Federal court system, she said she had always chosen women to be her law clerks.         ''The reason I always had women,'' she said, ''was because so often, when a woman makes good at something they always say that some man did it. So I just thought it would be better to have women. I wanted to show my confidence in women.''         Burnita Shelton decided as a young girl that she wanted to be a lawyer, although professional opportunities in the law were extremely limited for women. She was born Dec. 28, 1894, in Copiah County, Mississippi, where her father owned a plantation and served as clerk of the local chancery court. She often accompanied him to court. But while the family sent her brother to law school, she was sent to the Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati, where she studied voice and piano.         She was teaching piano when the United States entered World War I. Hoping to find a Government job that would enable her to go to law school at night, she moved to Washington, passed a Civil Service examination, and took a job with the Veterans Administration. She went to night school at National University Law School, which later became part of George Washington University.         After her graduation in 1919, Mrs. Matthews, now married to a lawyer, Percy A. Matthews, applied to the Veterans Administration for a job as a lawyer. When the agency told her that it would never hire a woman in the legal department, she opened her own law office. More Obstacles to Legal Career         There were other stumbling blocks as well. The local bar association refused to accept her application for membership, returning the check she had sent for membership dues. Judge Matthews included that check among the papers she donated to what is now the Burnita Shelton Matthews Collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, at Radcliffe College.         Her activities on behalf of women's rights began in law school. In 1919, she was among several dozen women who regularly picketed the White House on Sundays on behalf of women's suffrage. ''You could carry a banner,'' she recalled in the 1985 interview, ''but if you spoke, you were arrested for speaking without a permit. So when they asked me why I was there, I didn't answer.''         After women got the vote in 1920, she shifted the focus of her activities. She became the lawyer for the National Woman's Party, which was trying to persuade state legislatures to lift legal barriers to women. Mrs. Matthews researched state laws and drafted proposed bills. The National Woman's Party owned the property across the street from the Capitol where the Supreme Court's building is now located. In the 1920's, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft proposed acquiring the land for the Court, she went to the Chief Justice's home to try to persuade him to look elsewhere. Her efforts failed, but she represented the party in the condemnation proceedings and won a generous settlement for it.         In the 1940's she also taught at the Washington College of Law, now part of American University. Upheld Right of Black Muslims         In 1949, President Truman named her to one of 20 new district judgeships that Congress had created to relieve a backlog in district court dockets. Among her rulings was one upholding the right of Black Muslims in the local prison to conduct religious services.         In a 1955 case, she refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer Paul Robeson, who was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and of supporting various pro-Communist activities, . Mr. Robeson's passport was withheld from 1950 to 1958 and was restored to him when, in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled the State Department's action unconstitutional.         On the Court of Appeals, Judge Matthews ruled that the Social Security Administration could not cut off disability benefits without a hearing.         In 1984, President Reagan commended her for her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit.''         Her husband died in 1969. They had no children. Judge Matthews is survived by four sisters-in-law and 11 nieces and nephews. She will be buried in the family cemetery in Copiah County, Mississippi.       
        Lea Lake, for the last 55 years a proprietor of Sweet's, the oldest seafood restaurant in New York City, died of heart failure at Lutheran Hospital in Brooklyn on Sunday. She was 89 years old and lived in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.         Lea Lake, for the last 55 years a proprietor of Sweet's, the oldest seafood restaurant in New York City, died of heart failure at Lutheran Hospital in Brooklyn on Sunday. She was 89 years old and lived in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.         Miss Lake was involved with the restaurant from her childhood.         It was founded in 1842 by Abraham M. Sweet on Fulton Street in Manhattan in what is now the South Street Seaport. Miss Lake's father, James, walked into the restaurant on the morning after the Great Blizzard of 1888 asking for work and was hired as a waterboy - the job today known as busboy. Twenty-nine years later he bought Sweet's from the proprietor's son, Edward.         Miss Lake took over on the death of her father in 1933. A small, soft-voiced woman, she was in charge for many decades. One of the first things she did in 1933 was to discontinue the boarding house that had been an adjunct of the restaurant since its early days.         Sweet's operated continuously in the block known as Schermerhorn Row, between South and Front Streets, except for two periods. One was in the years just before and during the Civil War, and the other covered 18 months in 1982 and 1983 when the landmark house occupied by the restaurant was restored.         Miss Lake's partner, Andrew Gerzel, who has managed the restaurant since 1966, recalled last night that as a young woman, she had aspired to a career in show business and had appeared in at least one Broadway musical in the 1920's.         Miss Lake is survived by her sister, Queenie A. McFarland of Caldwell, N.J.

Monica Bergman, an art historian, died of cancer Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 40 years old and lived in Manhattan.         A graduate of Vassar College, Mrs. Bergman had a master's degree from Cambridge University. She was a Fulbright Scholar in 1975 and specialized in the art of India.         She is survived by her husband, Nicholas; her mother and stepfather, Dale and Harold Kaufman of Manhattan, and her father, Eric Lawyer of Atlantic Beach, L.I.       
        Gertrude Soule, a Shaker leader whose storytelling helped visitors understand a rapidly disappearing religious community, has died at 93, leaving only two Shaker women in their 90's in the state.         Gertrude Soule, a Shaker leader whose storytelling helped visitors understand a rapidly disappearing religious community, has died at 93, leaving only two Shaker women in their 90's in the state.         Richard Kathmann, director at Shaker Village, said today that Miss Soule died in her sleep over the weekend.         Miss Soule's death leaves Sister Ethel Hudson, 92, and Eldress Bertha Lindsay, 90, as the last Shakers in a community that once numbered 400 men, women and children.         Miss Soule was born in Topsham, Me. At age 11, she and her sister were placed with the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Me., after the death of their mother. Chose to Remain         She chose to remain with the community when she turned 21 and signed the Shaker vow of celibacy. In the early 1950's, she became an eldress, or spiritual leader, of the Sabbathday Lake Society. In 1957, she was appointed to the Lead Ministry of the United Society of Believers.         She moved to Canterbury Shaker Village in 1972 to assume further responsibilities as a member of the Lead Ministry and served as vice president of the nonprofit educational corporation and museum that administers the historic site founded in the 1780's.         Miss Soule frequently told stories to the children visiting the museum. Her favorite was about an orphaned seal pup she helped raise when she lived with her father. They kept the seal in the family bathtub.         Famous for their simple, efficient creations, including the flat broom, clothespin and ladderback chairs, Shakers once numbered 6,000 at 24 communities throughout the country.         Now, the villages in Canterbury and Sabbathday Lake are the only ones with living Shakers. There are five undisputed shakers in Maine, and others admitted as new members. The Canterbury village has admitted no new members since 1965.         Services for Miss Soule will be held Tuesday at the Dwelling House Chapel at the village, Mr. Kathmann said.

        Lyn Blumenthal, a leading video artist who was also a prominent lecturer and writer, died of a heart attack at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 39 years old.         Lyn Blumenthal, a leading video artist who was also a prominent lecturer and writer, died of a heart attack at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 39 years old.         In 1976, Ms. Blumenthal was a co-founder of the Video Data Bank, for which she and a colleague, Kate Horsfield, taped more than 160 interviews with leading visual artists of the 1960's and 70's. Based at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Data Bank later expanded to become the country's largest video art archive.         Ms. Blumenthal, a native of Chicago, received a graduate degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1976. She moved to New York City shortly thereafter and began her career as a video artist. Her works were shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art and elsewhere in this country and Europe.         She also became well-known as a consultant to alternative arts organizations, and as a panelist and adviser to agencies that included the National Endowment for the Arts.         Among her last projects was ''What Does She Want,'' a series of six feature-length video art films by different artists focusing on women's issues.         She is survived by her father, Dr. Sunoll Blumenthal, and her mother, the former Frima Horwitch, both of Chicago, and by her brother, Alan, of Miami.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Adela Rogers St. Johns, the journalist, author and screenwriter, died yesterday morning in the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, Calif., her grandson, George St. Johns, said. She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         Adela Rogers St. Johns, the journalist, author and screenwriter, died yesterday morning in the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, Calif., her grandson, George St. Johns, said. She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         As a journalist for Hearst and other publications, she wrote about such stories as the Leopold-Loeb murder trial, the abdication of Edward VIII, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and the trial of the kidnapper, Bruno Hauptmann.         She also wrote many articles for Photoplay magazine, becoming known as its ''Mother Confessor of Hollywood.''         Her screenwriting included two Tom Mix westerns, and her published fiction included short stories and serials for The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping and other magazines. Worked for Several Papers         The Hearst publications for which she worked over the years included The San Francisco Examiner, The Los Angeles Herald and The Chicago American. She also worked for the Hearst-owned International News Service.         Mel Durslag, another longtime writer for Hearst publications, said yesterday, ''She was a tough, hard newspaper woman, a figure from the old, roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no longer lives.''         Mrs. St. Johns was the daughter of a California criminal lawyer, and she spent much time in courtrooms in her youth. She wrote in a 1969 volume of memoirs, ''The Honeycomb,'' that what she did not learn at school she had ''learned from pimps, professional prostitutes, gamblers, bank robbers, poets, newspapermen, jury bribers, millionaire dipsomaniacs and murderers.'' Began Career in 1913         She was born in Los Angeles on May 20, 1894, the daughter of Earl Rogers and the former Harriet Belle Greene. She grew up mainly in Los Angeles, attending several schools, including Hollywood High School, and then traveled widely, with time out to study piano in Leipzig.         She began her newspaper career in 1913 as a reporter and feature writer with The San Francisco Examiner. She worked for The Los Angeles Herald from 1914 to 1918, The Chicago American in 1928 and The New York American in 1929.         Mary Pickford, Tom Mix, Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino were some of the celebrities she interviewed over the years.         Mrs. St. Johns's first short story, ''The Black Cat,'' was published in 1918. Her first novel, ''The Sky Rocket'' (1923) became a movie, and so did ''A Free Soul'' (1924) and ''A Single Standard'' (1925). Taught at Universities         She taught at the Graduate School of Journalism of the University of California at Los Angeles from 1950 to 1952, and at other universities over the years.         Her books included ''How to Write a Short Story'' (1952) and ''Affirmative Prayer in Action'' (1955), and ''Final Verdict,'' a biography of her father, in 1962.         Other magazines to which she contributed included McCall's, Ladies Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Reader's Digest.         Mrs. St. Johns was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Nixon in 1970.         Her 1914 marriage to William Ivan St. Johns ended in divorce in 1929, and so did her subsequent marriages, to Richard Hyland and to Francis P. O'Toole.         She is survived by a daughter, Elaine St. Johns of Arroyo Grande; two sons, McCullah St. Johns of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Richard Rogers St. Johns of Los Angeles; 10 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.         Memorial services will be held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, Calif.

She was 91 years old and lived in Caldwell, N.J.         Queenie A. McFarland, who was ac tive until two years ago in the manage-ment of Sweets seafood restaurant, a family business at Fulton and South Streets, died of cardiac arrest Sunday at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, N.J. She was 91 years old and lived in Caldwell, N.J.         Mrs. McFarland was a daughter of James Lake, who in 1917 acquired Sweets, the oldest seafood house in New York City, founded by Abraham M. Sweet in 1842. Her sister, Lea Lake, died in April at 89 after having been a co-owner of Sweets since 1933, when their father died.         Mrs. McFarland was involved with the restaurant in childhood but was associated for several decades with Ohrbach's specialty store. In 1962, after her retirement there, she rejoined Sweets. She worked there until two years ago, when she was severely injured by an intruder at the restaurant during the victory parade in lower Manhattan for the New York Mets, who had won the World Series.         Mrs. McFarland is survived by two sons, John, of East Hanover, N.J., and Benjamin, of Andover, N.J.; five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Dawn made her Broadway stage debut in March 1911 in an imported musical called ''The Pink Lady.'' The show was a hit, running for three years, and although she was not the leading lady Miss Dawn skyrocketed to fame.         She was once the mascot of both Army and Navy at one of their annual football games. And Miss Dawn said that when West Point's cadets tossed their hats onto the stage, one hat belonged to a cadet who later became President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career Began in London         Miss Dawn began her career in London musical comedies and appeared in ''The Dollar Princess'' and ''Dear Little Denmark,'' as well as ''The Pink Lady.'' In New York, Victor Herbert is said to have written ''The Debutant'' for her and she had roles in ''Up in Mabel's Room'' and ''The Demi-Virgin.'' Although she was an exceptional beauty, most of her roles were not starring ones.         Hazel Dawn was born in Ogden, Utah, and named Hazel Tout. Her family later moved to Wales, where her father, a Mormon, was a missionary. In London, according to one version of how she got her name, a producer, Ivan Caryll, met her at a party and said: ''You're just the one I want for my new play. But you must change your name. Tout is honest but impossible. You are so young, so fresh, so pink, you remind one of the dawn; you shall be Hazel Dawn.''         Miss Dawn starred in the original ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and appeared in early silent films of the Famous Players, among whom were Marion Davies and Margaret Clark. Married Into Wealth         In 1927, Miss Dawn married Charles Gruwell, a mining engineer from Montana, reportedly ''one of the richest men in the West,'' and largely gave up her career, though she did appear on stage in ''Wonder Boy'' in 1931. After Mr. Gruwell died in 1941, she went to work in the casting department of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, retiring from there about 25 years ago. She also appeared in 1946 in the film ''Margie.''         Miss Dawn is survived by her daughter, Dawn Gruwell Kaufman, and her son, Charles E. Gruwell, both of New York, five grandsons and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Groman was born in New Britain, Conn., where she studied ballet with Lillian Sjovall before moving to New York at the age of 11 to study at the Professional Children's School and at the American Ballet Theater School. She danced a wide variety of corps and solo roles in the City Ballet through the 1950's and then became a soloist in Ballet Theater in the early 1960's.         Miss Groman left a few years later to join the First Chamber Dance Quartet, a small troupe that been formed in 1961 by two dancers she had known in the City Ballet, Lois Bewley and William Carter. After that troupe disbanded in 1969, Miss Groman and Charles Bennett, a member of the first troupe, formed the First Chamber Dance Company. Original Choreography         Like the Quartet, the First Chamber Dance Company made its mark by touring extensively and presenting original choreography. Miss Groman and Mr. Bennett were joined by Michael Uthoff, Lisa Bradley and Marjorie Mussman, all former Joffrey Ballet members. Unlike the Quartet, which concentrated on ballets by its own members, the second group also drew from outside choreographers.         In recent years, Miss Groman headed the Groman Dance and Exercise School in New York.         She is survived by her father, Walter E., of New Britain; and three brothers, Walter J., of Toronto, John E., of Dedham, Mass., and Dr. David B., of Prince Edward Island, Canada.       
        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Mrs. Bunche was active in many civic and community organizations over the years. She served as a director on a number of boards, among them the New York City Youth Board, the Inwood House for Unwed Mothers, the Japan International Christian University and the advisory board of the Metropolitan Chapter of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. At her death, she was a board member of the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations, the Irving Berlin God Bless America Fund and the Play Schools Association, which honored her last year for 37 years of service.         Mrs. Bunche was a native of Montgomery, Ala., where her father had been a Republican national committeeman and an advocate of civil rights. She met her husband when she was a first-grade teacher at a school in Washington, where Mr. Bunche was a political science professor at Howard University. They were married in 1930; he died in 1971.         She is survived by a daughter, Joan, of Manhattan; a son, Ralph Jr., of London; a sister, Aileen Davis of Washington; a brother, Booker Harris of Hartford, and six grandchildren.         A service will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 1076 Madison Avenue on Tuesday at 1 P.M.       
        Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.         Baroness Lee of Asheridge, as she was known after being made a life peer in 1970, held a seat in Parliament for 27 years. She was a member of the Labor Party's national executive from 1958 to 1970 and served as party chairman in 1967 and 1968.         The present leader of the party, Neil Kinnock, on Thursday recalled her as ''a woman of brilliance and vision, a great socialist, who inspired so many and was loved by all who knew her warmth and passion for justice.''         Given special responsibility for the arts in 1965 by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, she played a crucial political role in starting the Open University, which provided higher education by correspondence, over radio and television and at evening classes to many students who had had no other university-level studies. Lesson for a Teacher         Her lifelong concern for the underprivileged was sharpened by her experience while teaching for two years in the late 1920's in a village near Lochgelly in Fifeshire, eastern Scotland.         ''I did not believe that there was any good reason why either the children or myself should come to terms with life as we found it in that bleak mining village,'' she wrote in her volume of memoirs ''This Great Journey.''         ''Most of the misery I saw around me in school, in the streets, and in private homes, had its roots in the poverty of the place,'' she said. ''I did not see how, within the four walls of a classroom, I could ever hope to change any of that.''         She ran successfully for Parliament and represented a Scottish district from 1929 until she lost the seat in 1931. She represented another district, near the industrial city of Birmingham in England, from 1945 until losing that seat in a general election in 1970. She then automatically acquired a seat in the House of Lords on being elevated to the peerage.         A New York Times editorial commented at the time: ''How Scotland's fiery Jennie would have scorned the robes of a baroness early in her Labor Party career!'' Married to Bevan         She was born Janet Lee on Nov. 3, 1904 in Lochgelly. Her father, James Lee, was active in the trade union movement. Her paternal grandfather, Michael Lee, won renown in the movement, rising to be a member of the Scottish Miners' Executive.         Lady Lee was married in 1934 to Aneurin Bevan, a prominent Labor Party figure who was known as Nye. A former coal miner, he was a elected to Parliament in 1929 and remained a Member of Parliament for 31 years, serving as Minister of Health from 1945 to 1951. He died in 1960.         After Jennie Lee was elected to Parliament from Staffordshire in 1945, and Mr. Bevan was re-elected to Parliament in the same elections, they became known as ''Britain's first man-and-wife parliamentary team.''         Lady Lee, who held degrees from the University of Edinburgh, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Cambridge University. Her books included ''My Life with Nye,'' published in 1980, in addition to ''This Great Journey,'' which was published in the United States in 1942 after appearing first in Britain.         Lady Lee and Mr. Bevan had no children, and she has no survivors.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         The reports said Ms. Onassis had been staying with childhood friends at an exclusive country club outside the Argentine capital. Her father, Aristotle Onassis, laid the foundation of his self-made fortune in shipping, real estate and high finance in Argentina and was a dual citizen of that country and Greece.         Mr. Onassis died in 1975 in France and his daughter and only surviving child was left in charge of the Onassis Group, with assets then variously estimated at $500 million to $1 billion, most of it in shipping. Forbes magazine, citing a worldwide slump in that industry, reported in 1987 that the figure probably had shrunk to $250 million or less.         Mr. Onassis' two major shipping companies were Springfield Shipping of New York City and Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Onassis gave up her American citizenship. She learned about business and finance in the New York offices of her father, beginning as a 20-year-old secretary. After his death, she gradually strengthened her hold over the Onassis Group, although some questions remained in the late 1970's as to just how much control she exerted and how much she left to day-to-day managers.         One of the world's richest women, Miss Onassis was no stranger to personal misfortune. There was the death of her only brother, Alexander, in a private-plane crash in 1973. She herself went through four much-publicized marriages and divorces. Churchill and Callas         The social life on ''Ari'' Onassis' 325-foot yacht, named Christina, was legendary and included the likes of Winston Churchill and the soprano Maria Callas. In fact, Mr. Onassis was romantically linked with Miss Callas when his own marriage to the former Athina (Tina) Livanos, another shipping heiress, broke up in 1959.         Tina Onassis eventually was remarried to her former husband's arch rival, Stavros Niarchos. And Ari Onassis, in 1968, married Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of President John F. Kennedy, whom he first met in 1963.         Christina Onassis defied her father in 1971 by marrying Joseph Bolker, a millionaire home builder and real-estate man, A divorced father of four, he was 27 years her senior and the union broke up within months, apparently at the insistence of her father.         Her next marriage, strongly promoted by her father, took place shortly after his death. Her second husband was Alexander Andreadis, a Greek shipping and banking heir. It, too, lasted only 14 months.         Miss Onassis' third marriage, in Moscow in 1978 to Sergei Kauzov, a Soviet shipping agent, again made front-page headlines, as did her flight to Greece a few days later and their separation in 1979. Marries Frenchman         She married a French businessman, Thierry Roussel, in 1984 and had a daughter with him, Athina, the following January. They filed for divorce eight months later.         Ms. Onassis was said to have never felt close to her stepmother. Friends in Athens said Mr. Onassis was thinking of divorcing the former Mrs. Kennedy at the time of his death and had intended to limit a divorce settlement to $3 million rather than the $250,000 a year provided in his will.         The reports of a forthcoming divorce were denied by Christina, who in 1977 was said to have made a much more generous multi-million settlement in return for which Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dropped all further claims against the estate.       
        Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Though Miss Seefried spent most of her career with the Vienna State Opera, she sang frequently at Covent Garden in London, at La Scala in Milan and at music festivals in Salzburg, Edinburgh, Lucerne and elsewhere. She was also a respected recital and concert singer. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in November 1953, as Susanna in Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' - one of her signature roles.         Miss Seefried was born on Oct. 9, 1919, in Kongetried, a small town in Bavaria. Her father started to give her music lessons when she was a small child, and at the age of 11 she sang the role of Gretel in a performance of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' She studied at the Augsburg Conservatory, and in 1939 joined the Aachen Opera at the invitation of Herbert von Karajan.         She made her Vienna State Opera debut in 1943, as Eva in Wagner's ''Meistersinger,'' and remained with the company until her retirement in 1980.         Miss Seefried made several concert tours of Europe, the United States and the Far East in the 1950's. In 1953, she and her husband, the violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, did a world concert tour together. 'Authority of Style'         From the start of her career, Miss Seefried was praised for the clarity of her voice and her appealing stage presence. Reviewing her Metropolitan Opera debut, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times, ''The shining light of this performance was Miss Seefried, whose beautiful voice and brilliancy and authority of style won her instant recognition.''         During several seasons in the 1950's, she appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra under the direction of Bruno Walter. Reviewing her 1956 performance of ''Et Incarnatus Est'' from the Mozart Mass in C minor, Howard Taubman said in The Times: ''The top of her soprano may not have the brilliance of some other singers, but she is an artist. She sang with warmth and tenderness and with a richness of understanding.''         Though her repertory came to include works by Hindemith, Poulenc, Berg and other modern composers, she was best known for her work in operas by Mozart, including Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni,'' and by Strauss, including Octavian in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and the Composer in ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' She also sang Marzelline in Beethoven's ''Fidelio.''         Miss Seefried recorded most of her operatic repertory and several albums of lieder.         She is survived by her husband and two daughters.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.
