         Barbara E. Brooks, an editor at three major women's magazines, died yesterday at her sister's home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 39 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lymphoma, said the sister, Suzanne Steinau.         For the last four years Ms. Brooks was the home director of Family Circle, where she was in charge of the magazine's decorating, remodeling, gardening and crafts coverage.         In a project to adapt housing to the needs of modern working women, she and an architect and a builder -- both women -- created what they called the Busy Woman's Dream House, with a design that was streamlined to minimize housework and maintenance. The project was displayed at the National Association of Home Builders' show in Atlanta in 1990.         That same year Ms. Brooks's magazine work won an award from the International Home Furnishing Center.         She started her magazine career as an associate decorating editor at Mademoiselle. Later she was hired to edit major articles at House Beautiful. In 1980 she went to Family Circle, where she started as its decorating editor.         Ms. Brooks was born in Queens. She was a graduate of Boston University and earned a master's degree in fine arts from Sarah Lawrence.         Her sister is the only immediate survivor.       
         Mary Lazar, the wife of the literary and talent agent Irving P. (Swifty) Lazar, died last Thursday in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 60.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lazar was born in Aurora, Ill. She began her career as a model, and appeared in advertisements as a "Coca-Cola girl." She later headed her own television and motion picture production company, Juno Productions, and worked in the development department of Telepictures Productions. From 1988 to 1991 she was a West Coast editor for Simon & Schuster.         In addition to her husband, with whom she shared homes in Beverly Hills, Manhattan and Southampton, L.I., she is survived by two sisters, Anita Rosenow of Boulder, Colo., and Holly Benfer of Norco, Calif.       
         Jeanne Sauve, a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada in the 1980's, died on Tuesday in Montreal. She was 70.         Her death was announced by the office of the Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II. It did not give the cause of death.         A former television journalist and freelance columnist, Mrs. Sauve entered politics in 1972 by winning election as a Member of Parliament from a district outside Montreal now known as Laval-les-Rapides.         After two years as a back-bencher, she was named as a junior minister in the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, overseeing science and technology and eventually the environment and communications. A Difficult Passage         But it was as Speaker, the keeper of the rules and traditions in the lower house, that Mrs. Sauve broke barriers and gained a national reputation.         When she was named to the post in 1980, she was still best known as part of a political elite that had congregated in Montreal in the 1950's to discuss art and politics and nationalism.         One participant was Mr. Trudeau, then a law professor and editor; another was Rene Levesque, a radio commentator who would later became a secessionist and Premier of Quebec, and a major adversary of Mr. Trudeau.         Her appointment drew criticism. Not only was she the first woman to preside over a forum that is still overwhelmingly male, but she was viewed by the Conservative opposition as lacking established ties to the House and knowledge of its often baroque procedures.         In her first two years, Mrs. Sauve was severely tested by strategists from the opposition who barraged her with points of order and privilege. But eventually even her adversaries paid tribute to her firmness and fairness, and she remained Speaker until 1984. Finally Won Respect         When Mr. Trudeau named her to the largely ceremonial but highly respected position of Governor General, she was also the first woman in that post, where she served until 1990.         Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit in Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, on April 26, 1922. She was educated at the University of Ottawa and University of Paris.         In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman who also served as a minister to Mr. Trudeau; he died last year. She is survived by a son, Jean-Francois.         Correction:  January 29, 1993, Friday         An obituary headline yesterday about a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada misidentified her. She was Jeanne Sauve.       
         Mitzi Berger Hamovitch, an English professor who taught at Queens College for more than 30 years, died on Thursday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. She was 68 and lived in Great Neck.         She died after heart surgery, said her husband, William Hamovitch, a retired economics professor and provost at Queens College.         She was the editor of "The Hound & Horn Letters" (University of Georgia Press, 1982). The book was a collection of letters between the editor of the Hound & Horn, a literary magazine published between 1927 and 1934, and the magazine's writers.         Born in Montreal, she moved to Buffalo in 1946 with her husband and earned her master's degree in English at the University of Buffalo. In 1953, the couple began teaching at Queens College. In 1978, she earned her doctorate from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She retired in 1989.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Susan Hamovitch of Brooklyn, and a brother, Monty Berger of Montreal.       
         Meredith Bowman Neuffer, 70, an artist who specialized in Oriental brush painting, died on Friday at her home in Weston, Conn.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Ms. Neuffer's works, featuring flowers and landscapes painted on silk with color ink washes, are held in private and public collections, including the Smithsonian Institution. They were were also shown in New York City and Washington as part of an exhibit by the Sumi-e Society, an international organization of Oriental brush painters.         Ms. Neuffer was born in Brockton, Mass., and graduated from Skidmore College in 1944. She worked as radio copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency and as the arts and crafts editor at American Home magazine, both in Manhattan.         Surviving are a son, Mark, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Elizabeth Neuffer, of Washington.       
         Dorothy Van Doren, author, editor and widow of the poet and critic Mark Van Doren, died on Sunday at the Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn., where she lived. She was 96.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son John, of Evanston, Ill.         Mrs. Van Doren was born in San Francisco, but grew up in New York City. She was a graduate of Barnard College.         She published four novels, including "Those First Affections" (1938), a highly praised effort to create the subjective world of a young girl.         Later, she turned to light-hearted autobiography. "The Country Wife" (1950) was an informal discourse on matrimony, parenthood and life as an amateur farmer in Connecticut. "The Professor and I" (1959) told of life with her husband the poet, and "Men, Women and Cats" (1960) reported further observations on family life.         She was for many years an editor on The Nation, and during World War II ran the English desk at the Office of War Information, which later became Voice of America.         Her husband died in 1972. In addition to her son John, she is survived by another son, Charles, of Cornwall, Conn., and Cortona, Italy, four grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Andrea Boroff Eagan, a journalist, educator, union founder and advocate for women, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         The interwoven themes of her career were social change, group action, women's rights, health and writing. Her causes grew from beliefs she formed as a campus activist in the turbulent protests of the 1960's.         In a celebrated moment during the Columbia University protests in 1968, she and Richard Eagan were unofficially married in a seized building. A chaplain pronounced them "children of the New Age." They were later legally married by that same chaplain.  Feminist Advice for Girls         Drawing on her personal experiences, Ms. Eagan wrote the first feminist advice book for teen-age girls, "Why Am I So Miserable, if These Are the Best Years of My Life?" (Lippincott, 1976). Later she wrote "The Newborn Mother: Stages of Her Growth" (Little, Brown, 1985), about the psychological changes in women after childbirth.         She also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, mostly on health and women. She was the editor of the National Women's Health Network Series for Pantheon Books and president of Healthright, a nonprofit organization.         Ms. Eagan was active in local and national efforts for abortion rights and other health and women's issues. She taught about them at New York University and at La Guardia, Manhattan Community and Hunter Colleges.         From 1983 to 1987 she served as the founding president of the National Writers Union, which won contracts for freelance writers at several national magazines. She was also a founding board member of the Writers Room, Manhattan office space for writers free of distractions.         Ms. Eagan, who graduated from Columbia in 1969, reaffirmed her protest-era beliefs in a 1988 interview in The Washington Post: "The fact is, we were absolutely correct in what we perceived as being wrong. We were in error only in that we weren't successful."         Her survivors include her mother, Dorothy Boroff of Manhattan; her husband, Richard, and two daughters, Molly and Daisy, the Tony-award winning child actress in "The Secret Garden."       
         Claire Huchet Bishop, an author of popular children's books and a leading opponent of anti-Semitism, died on Thursday at her home in Paris at the age of 94. She had resided in Manhattan for about 50 years.         The cause of death was a hemorrhage of the aorta, said Mira Felner, a friend.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop began her career following in the footsteps of her grandfather and mother, noted storytellers in her hometown of Le Havre, France. She carried on that tradition in Paris and the United States, then began transcribing her stories. Many Translations         Her resulting books, which won several prizes, have appeared in a dozen languages, and some continue to be reprinted. Two were made into films. Her first book, "The Five Chinese Brothers" (Coward), is being translated to Spanish, 55 years after its original publication.         The persecution of Jewish friends in France in World War II prompted the second theme of Mrs. Huchet Bishop's life. She began writing for children and adults on spiritual issues and became an advocate in efforts for religious and racial harmony.         A Catholic, she was credited with helping win the deletion of anti-Semitic passages from the catechism with her analysis, "How Catholics Look at Jews" (Paulist Press, 1974). In a delegation visiting the Pope in the 1980's, she encouraged formal Vatican recognition of Israel.         She also served as the president of the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1975-77 and of the Jewish-Christian-Fellowship of France from 1968 to 1981.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop was born in Geneva. As a young woman, she discontinued her studies at the Sorbonne to devote more time to storytelling. In 1924 she opened France's first library for children, L'Heure Joyeuse (The Joyous Hour), and served as its director for five years.         She married Frank Bishop, an American concert pianist, and moved to the United States. She was in charge of the children's reading room at the New York Public Library in the mid-1930's and was the children's book editor of Commonweal.         After retelling a fable about Chinese quintuplets with superhuman powers, she decided to write down her version. That led to its publication and her career as an author of about 30 books. Two were runners-up for the Maybery Award, the highest honor for children's books, and she won other awards and citations.         Often her books had serious themes. "Pancakes-Paris" (Viking, 1947) was about food scarcity in wartime France. "Twenty and Ten" (Viking, 1952) told the true story of Christian French youngsters who hid their Jewish playmates from the Nazis. Wonderworks made it into a film, "Miracle at Moreau," for PBS television.         Her husband died in 1944.       
         Judith Grad, a former counsel to the New York City Board of Ethics who in later life became a psychotherapist, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 68.         The cause of death was heart failure, her family said.         A native of Brooklyn and graduate of Brooklyn College, she put herself through New York University Law School at night by working as a legal secretary. She was an editor of the N.Y.U. Law Review and graduated first in her class. Joined Law Department         During the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay, Miss Grad worked in the city's Law Department, rising to chief of the Opinions and Legislation Division. There, she helped draft the 1974 state law that repealed the requirement for corroboration of testimony in the prosecution of sex offenders.         In 1978, Mayor Edward I. Koch recruited Miss Grad for the Board of Ethics. As counsel, she was involved in the investigation of city officials and employees for financial interests or private interests that were in conflict with the proper discharge of official duties. One case arising during her tenure involved charges of corruption against Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President who committed suicide in 1986. She retired after about 10 years in office.         Prior to her ethics work, Miss Grad did pro bono work for Odyssey House, the drug and alcohol treatment organization in New York, and ran group counseling sessions for women there. This stirred her interest in psychotherapy, which she pursued after leaving public service. She trained with the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis and, at the time of her death, was treating patients as a psychotherapist.         She became a board member of the Metropolitan Center for Mental Health, a psychiatric clinic on the Upper West Side that helps people unable to afford private treatment. She was board president of the Metropolitan Institute for Training in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, which is associated with the center.         Miss Grad is survived by her sister, Charlotte Schiff-Jones of Manhattan.       
         Marka Truesdale duPont, a patron of mental-health groups and the performing arts, died Tuesday at her home in Wilmington, Del. She was 82.         She had had a prolonged illness, her family said.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Chapin School. As a young woman, she worked for the Henry Street Settlement Theater.         Moving to Vermont in 1942, she became publisher and editor of The Burlington Daily News. During her tenure it won an award from Editor and Publisher magazine for exposing squalid conditions at a reform school for boys and at the state mental hospital in Waterbury.         Later, in Delaware, she was the founding chairman of that state's Mental Health Association and an officer and fund-raiser in the National Association for Mental Health, of which she was a past president.         Mrs. duPont's first marriage, to Grover Loening, an aviation designer with Orville Wright, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, A. Felix duPont Jr., a member of the duPont family of Wilmington; two daughters by her previous marriage, Louise Truesdale Loening of Landenberg, Pa., and Priscilla Loening Hanford of Paradise, Calif.; a son, Christopher T. duPont of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepson, Michael Hoyt duPont of Union, Wash.; a stepdaughter, Katharine duPont Gahagan of Wilmington, and a sister, Anne Truesdale Broadhurst of Wilton, Conn.       
         Maggie Hemingway, a British novelist, died on May 9, the British press reported late last week. She was 47 and lived in London and in Deal, a seaside resort near Dover.         The cause was defective functioning of the blood-forming organs, The Daily Telegraph said.         Ms. Hemingway won the Royal Society of Literature's Winifred Holtby Prize for her first novel, "The Bridge," which was published in Britain in 1986 and won critical praise there and in the United States.         Reviewing Atheneum's American edition in February 1987 in The New York Times Book Review, Eden Ross Lipson, an editor of the Book Review, wrote, "If you like your tea and fiction delicately seasoned and served exquisitely, this novel may be a perfect midwinter cup."         Ms. Hemingway was a distant relative of Ernest Hemingway, The Times of London said. She was born in Orford, in eastern Suffolk, studied at Edinburgh University and worked in publishing until "The Bridge" came out. Her other published novels are "Stop House Blues" (1988) and "The Postmen's House" (Trafalgar, 1992). She finished a fourth work of fiction, "Eyes," before she died.         Ms. Hemingway was separated from her husband and is survived by two daughters.       
         Dorothy B. Hughes, a mystery writer as well as a critic and historian of mystery fiction, died on Thursday at her home in Ashland, Ore. She was 88.         She died of complications from a stroke, said her daughter Suzy Sarna.         Ms. Hughes wrote 14 mystery novels, most of them set in the Southwest and involving an upper-class hero caught up in evil intrigue. Her best-known works include "The Cross-Eyed Bear" (1940), "Ride the Pink Horse" (1946), "The Expendable Man" (1964) and "In a Lonely Place" (1947), which was made into a movie starring Humphrey Bogart. In 1979 she won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, of which she was a founding member, for her critical biography "Erle Stanley Gardner: The Case of the Real Perry Mason" (1978).         Ms. Hughes was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. She also studied at the University of New Mexico and Columbia University. After working as a reporter and women's editor in the 1920's, she began reviewing crime fiction for The Albuquerque Tribune, The Los Angeles News, The Los Angeles Mirror and The New York Herald Tribune. In 1961 she began reviewing for The Los Angeles Times.         In 1978, the Mystery Writers of America gave her its Grand Master Award in recognition of her life's work in fiction and criticism.         In addition to her daughter Suzy, of Anacortes, Wash., she is survived by a brother, Frank Flanagan, of Phoenix; a sister, Calla Haye, of Santa Fe; another daughter, Holly Hughes of Rowe, N.M.; a son, Antony A. Hughes, of El Paso, Tex.; 10 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Penelope Gilliatt, a writer of fiction, journalism and screenplays, and a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 61.         She had been in poor health for some time.         Ms. Gilliatt (pronounced with a hard G) was best known for the film criticism she wrote from 1968 to 1979 for The New Yorker, where she shared reviewing duties with Pauline Kael, and for her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," a 1971 film starring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch.         Her short stories were marked by precision, compression and a gift for conveying a dramatic situation through dialogue. Anthony Burgess, reviewing her short-story collection "Nobody's Business" for The New York Times Book Review in 1971, wrote: "She is intelligent, economical, poignant, highly contemporary. She is also innovative."         Ms. Gilliatt, whose maiden name was Penelope Conner, was born in London. Her father, a barrister and later a judge, worked as a director of the BBC. After attending Queen's College, a private school, she came to the United States to enter Bennington College in Vermont on a scholarship. She dropped out during her first year. "I thought I should get on with life, and I'd run out of money," she later said in a newspaper interview. A Contest Winner         A brief period working for the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York ended when she won a short-story contest sponsored by British Vogue. She returned to London to join the magazine's staff, eventually becoming its features editor. She also contributed freelance articles to The Spectator and New Statesman.         From 1961 to 1967, Ms. Gilliatt served as film critic and, for one year, drama critic of The Observer in London. In 1968 she joined The New Yorker, where, in addition to reviewing film, she contributed many short stories and profiles.         Her first novel, "One by One" (1965), about a menage a trois, contained the seeds of her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," about a London couple, a man and a woman, in love with the same man. The screenplay, which was widely praised for its sensitive, literate treatment of a potentially exploitative subject, was nominated for an Academy Award.  The National Society of Film Critics named it the best screenplay of the year, and the New York film critics, in a tie vote, named her co-winner for best screenplay with Larry McMurtry, for "The Last Picture Show.         Ms. Gilliatt left The New Yorker in 1979 on an extended leave of absence after writing a profile on the novelist Graham Greene whose accuracy was challenged by Greene. A novelist, Michael Mewshaw, also complained to the magazine that material in the article had been taken, without credit, from an artcile he had written on Greene for The Nation. At the time, Ms. Gilliatt said that Mr. Greene's charges were a subtle form of practical joke. She continued to contribute short stories to the magazine and in recent years wrote profiles of John Cleese and Jonathan Miller. Known for Her Stories         Although Ms. Gilliatt wrote five novels, including "A State of Change" (1968) and "The Cutting Edge" (1979), she was best known for her stories, collected in "Come Back if It Doesn't Get Better" (1969), "Nobody's Business" (1972), "Splendid Lives" (1978), "Quotations From Other Lives" (1982) and "They Sleep Without Dreaming" (1985).         Ms. Gilliatt's New Yorker film criticism and profiles were collected in "Unholy Fools" (1973) and "Three-Quarter Face" (1980). Her last book was "To Wit: Skin and Bones of Comedy" (1990), a collection of essays.         Both her marriages, to Roger Gilliatt, a neurosurgeon, and the playwright John Osborne ended in divorce.         She is survived by a sister, Angela Conner of London, and a daughter, Nolan Osborne Parker of East Sussex.       
         Marjorie Henderson Buell, the creator of Little Lulu, the mischievous cartoon character with corkscrew curls who regularly outwitted the neighborhood boys, died on Sunday in the Elyria (Ohio) United Methodist Home. She was 88.         The cause was lymphoma, said John D. Harvith, the co-arranger in 1982 of the only comprehensive retrospective of Mrs. Buell's work, in Oberlin, Ohio.         "She was a pioneer in presenting a girl cartoon character who was resourceful, courageous and who regularly beat out the boys," said Mr. Harvith. Mrs. Buell, who was known as Marge, was also a role model for future cartoon entrepreneurs, since she kept control of the rights to the Little Lulu character. She licensed a host of spinoffs, including comic books, 26 animated cartoon features, greeting cards, dolls, games, puzzles, toys and coloring books.         The Lulu marketing empire was international, with comic books published in languages that included Arabic, Finnish, Japanese, Spanish and Greek. Mrs. Buell sold her copyrights to Western Publishing Company when she retired in 1971.         Mrs. Buell was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 1904. Her first cartoon was published in 1921, when she was 16, in The Philadelphia Ledger. Soon her work found a market in the Ledger syndicate, and ultimately in Life, when it was a comic magazine, as well as The Saturday Evening Post, The Country Gentleman, Judge and Collier's.         In 1934 The Saturday Evening Post asked her to draw a weekly cartoon for the magazine's back page. George Horace Lorimer, the editor, wanted a young female character to take the place of another cartoon that was moving from The Post to King Features Syndicate.         The first "Little Lulu" drawing appeared in December 1935. So popular had the character become by 1944 that Mrs. Buell took Lulu and her friends Tubby, Alvin, Annie and Wilbur from The Post and made the cartoon a daily syndicated comic strip. Lulu also served as the advertising mascot for Kleenex tissues until 1960.         Mrs. Buell is survived by her husband, Clarence Addison Buell; two sons, Lawrence I., of Boston, and Frederick H., of Warwick, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Genevieve Millet Landau, former editor in chief of Parents magazine and an expert in child development, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Landau joined the staff of Parents in 1957, becoming editor in chief in 1970. She resigned from the magazine in 1978 to create the Hasbro Center for Child Development and Education, a nonprofit arm of the Hasbro Toy Company.         She served as editorial director of the Dell Magazine Group from 1981 until she retired in 1987. She later worked as a volunteer for the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization that helps former convicts.         She graduated in 1954 from Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Besides numerous articles, she was the author of a book, "The Gift of Play," (Walker & Company, 1980), with Maria W. Piers.         Survivors include her husband, Sidney; two daughters, Elizabeth Millet of Manhattan and Jessica Rosenberg of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author, editor and illustrator of children's books, died on Wednesday at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. She was 75 and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         Her sister, Barbara Klaw, said the cause was lung cancer.         Mrs. Bevans's most widely distributed work is her illustrations for the original "Pat the Bunny," (Golden Books, 1940), created by Dorothy Kunhardt, the second-best-selling children's book ever, after "Peter Rabbit."         She is author and illustrator of "Thomas Retires," (Viking, 1939) a children's book. Other works include " 'I Wonder Why,' Thought the Owl," (Putnam, 1965) and "Danny Kaye's Around the World Story Book," (Random House, 1960), of which she was co-editor.         She was editor of a best-selling book for adults, "Vogue's Book of Etiquette," (Simon & Schuster, 1948), compiled by the late Millicent H. Fenwick. She also edited "McCall's Book of Everyday Etiquette" (Golden Press, 1960).         Born in New York City, she was the daughter of the historian and critic Carl Van Doren and of Irita Van Doren, for many years literary editor of The New York Herald Tribune. She studied art at Cooper Union in Manhattan.         In 1975 Mrs. Bevans and her family moved to West Cornwall, where she served on the Cornwall Board of Education from 1977 to 1983. She was also Cornwall's representative on the board of Housatonic Valley Regional High School.         She and her husband, Tom Torre Bevans, founded The Cornwall Chronicle in 1991. This monthly newspaper of community news is distributed free to all Cornwall residents and many out-of-town subscribers.         Besides her husband and sister of West Cornwall, surviving are two daughters, Anne Bevans of West Cornwall and Jane Duber of Lillooet, British Columbia; a son, John, of West Cornwall, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  July 25, 1993, Sunday         An obituary last Sunday about Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author and illustrator of children's books, included a work among her credits erroneously. "Pat the Bunny" (Golden Books, 1940) was illustrated by its author, Dorothy Kunhardt.       
         Frances Ruth Grant, who spent her life opposing dictatorships and promoting human rights in the Americas, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Miss Grant's dedication to Latin American culture, art and human rights began in her childhood. The daughter of a pioneer of New Mexico's statehood, she was born and raised in the remote pueblo of Abiquiu in the foothills of the Valle Grande mountains. It was there that she absorbed the atmosphere of Hispanic-American culture.         She was educated at Barnard College and graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1918. She also received extensive tutoring in economics, political science, music and the arts. A Museum Founder         She was a founder in 1923 of the Nicholas Roerich Museum in Manhattan, under whose auspices she went to the Far East and wrote about the philosophies and cultures of India and Tibet. She served as a vice president of the museum until 1937.         Miss Grant first visited Latin America in 1929 and after that devoted most of her energy to the republics of the hemisphere. She lectured at virtually all of its universities and centers of learning and started some of the first cultural interchanges, including exhibitions, musical programs and public forums.         Her work was primarily responsible for the Roerich Pact, an inter-American agreement for the preservation of cultural sites signed at the White House by 21 republics in 1935. She founded the Pan American Women's Association in 1930 and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom in 1950 and headed both of them into her late 80's. A Journal Editor         From 1951 until the mid-1980's, she edited the English and Spanish editions of Hemispherica, a journal published by the Inter-American Association. For this she received a special citation in 1982 at Columbia University from the trustees of the annual Maria Moors Cabot prizes in inter-American journalism.         Recognized as a leader in the defense of civil and politcal liberties, she was a past chairman of the Latin American section and secretary of the International League for Human Rights. The league is a nongovernmental agency accredited by the United Nations whose predecessors date back to the Dreyfus affair in France nearly a century ago.         Jose Figueres Ferrer, then the President of Costa Rica and himself a resolute champion of democracy, paid tribute to Miss Grant in a public address in New York in 1951. He called her "the greatest fighter for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere."       
         Joyce Haber, known for her barbed commentaries as one of the last of Hollywood's powerful gossip columnists and the author of a best-selling book on the movie industry, died on Thursday at a hospital in Los Angeles.  Her age was variously given as 60 or 62.         The cause was kidney and liver failure, said a spokesman for the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.         Miss Haber and her syndicated column played a role in a sensational case in the 1970's that involved the actress Jean Seberg, who suffered a premature labor and later committed suicide.         In 1968, The Los Angeles Times named Miss Haber as a successor to Hedda Hopper, who had died in 1966. Louella Parsons, a rival Hollywood columnist for the Hearst papers, had retired in 1965.         Miss Haber once described Melina Mercouri as having "wall-to-wall hips, an ear-to-ear smile and more teeth than a pretzel has salt." She said Julie Andrews had "a kind of flowering dullness about her."         Miss Haber retired as a columnist to write "The Users" (Delacorte, 1976), a best-selling novel. Its passages on the exploits of 70 real and fictional Hollywood characters disturbed even some of her friends and sources. Role in Seberg Case         The Seberg episode started in 1970 when Miss Haber wrote about "the baby Miss A is expecting and its father." The column said: "Papa's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther."         Three months later, Newsweek named Miss Seberg, a white actress, as the expectant mother. The day after reading that, she went into premature labor. The baby girl died three days later. Miss Seberg and her husband, Romain Gary, a French novelist and former diplomat, sued Newsweek and settled for several thousand dollars.         It was later disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had plotted to plant the rumor in a campaign to discredit and harass radicals, whom Miss Seberg had supported. But the agency's files said that J. Edgar Hoover had temporarily delayed the plan when the Haber column item mysteriously appeared.         Mr. Gary said Miss Seberg became despondent and tried to commit suicide on the anniversaries of the baby's death. Eventually she killed herself in 1979. Mr. Gary, who blamed the F.B.I. for her troubles, committed suicide in 1980, although the reason was unclear.         Miss Haber said that her report was based on a letter given to her by an editor, whom she did not name, and that she had not been aware of any F.B.I. involvement.         Miss Haber was a child of the movie industry. As a six-year-old, she acted in three "Our Gang" features. She was educated at Brearley School, Bryn Mawr College and Barnard.         After working briefly in summer stock theater, as a political campaign aide and at an advertising agency, she joined Time magazine as a researcher.         She was divorced from Douglas S. Cramer Jr., a television and film producer.         Her survivors include a son, Douglas 3d, and a daughter, Courtney Cramer.       
         Leona Dubnick, coordinator of the gifted-education program for the Huntington, L.I., public schools until her retirement in 1985, died on her 65th birthday Friday at the Williamsburg (Va.) Community Hospital. She lived in Huntington and Pound Ridge, N.Y., until moving to Williamsburg less than two years ago.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Dubnick graduated from Brooklyn College, earned an M.A. at City College and studied for a doctorate at Teachers College of Columbia University. She joined the Huntington school system as a teacher and designed, developed and administered its gifted-education curriculum and program.         In the late 1970's she also created and broadcast "Ask the Teacher" radio programs at the Long Island station WGSM and at WVOX in Westchester. From 1988 to 1991 she was public-relations director, news editor and writer at WPOB-FM in Plainview-Old Bethpage, L.I.         Mrs. Dubnick is survived by her husband of 43 years, Dr. Lester Dubnick; her daughter, Monica L. Mowery of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a sister, Stella Monchick of West Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Olivia L. Gilliam, a foundation executive, died on Sunday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 55 and also lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         For the last 20 years, Mrs. Gilliam was the executive director of the Myrin Institute, a foundation whose causes include international affairs, the environment and drug-abuse education through its offshoot, the American Council for Drug Research. Through Myrin, she was a founding editor and the artistic director of the Orion Society's Orion Nature Quarterly.         She worked with the Office of the Tibetan Mission to the United Nations in the 1960's. She also was active in the founding of Conservation International and served on the board of the New York Blood Center.         Surviving are her husband, Marion G. H. Gilliam; her mother, Natalie Davenport of Great Barrington and John's Island, Fla.; a sister, Baroness Bernard D'Anglejan-Chatillon of Paris and Vero Beach, Fla.; a half brother, William C. Ladd of Brewster, Mass.; a half sister, Cornelia Goode of Melbourne, Australia; two stepbrothers, Geoffrey and Eric DeBellaigue, both of London, and a stepsister, Cornelia Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H.       
         Linda M. Martelli, a copy editor at The New York Times for the last 11 years, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 43 and lived in Manhattan and Brigantine, N.J.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Martelli was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Pennsylvania State University. She worked at The Danbury News-Times in Connecticut and The Delaware County Daily Times in Pennsylvania before joining The Philadelphia Bulletin in 1980.         She joined The New York Times in 1982, and worked as a makeup editor and as a copy editor on the metropolitan desk and the national editions. At her death, she was a copy editor for the Connecticut Weekly section.         Ms. Martelli is survived by her father, Fred L. Martelli of Ridley Park, Pa.; and a brother, Fred J. Martelli of West Chester, Pa.       
         Betty Klarnet, who retired last year as managing editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75.         She had suffered a long illness, said her daughter, Katy Klarnet.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Klarnet attended Brooklyn College. She joined Woman's Day as an associate editor in 1950. She later filled leading editorial positions at Look, Family Circle, Family Health and American Home magazines and became managing editor of Harper's Bazaar in 1977.         Besides her daughter, a resident of West Haven, Conn., Mrs. Klarnet is survived by two grandchildren.         Correction:  September 30, 1993, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Betty Klarnet, the retired managing editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine who died on Sept. 26, misstated the residence of her daughter, Katy Klarnet. She lives in West Hartford, Conn., not West Haven.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Alice S. Morris, for many years a figure on New York's literary scene, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was sudden respiratory failure, her family said.         From 1951 to 1968, Mrs. Morris was the literary editor of Harper's Bazaar. Herself a writer and critic of modern fiction, she helped to introduce many fresh American authors to the reading public.         PEN International awarded her a Sue Kaufman Lifetime Achievement Award in 1977 for the editorial assistance she had given to new and emerging writers.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up in Morristown, N.J.         After retiring from Harper's Bazaar at the age of 65, Mrs. Morris, who had no college degree, started a new career at Columbia University teaching short-story writing. She later lectured at the New School, where she continued to hold classes until she turned 80.         She was the editor of "An Uncommon Reader" (Avon Books, 1965), a selection of 35 outstanding short stories she had steered toward publication in Harper's Bazaar. She also wrote a book of poems, "Crane on the Hackmatack." At her death she was working on a series of humorous poems.         Mrs. Morris's marriage to Harvey Breit, playwright and novelist, ended in divorce. Mr. Breit died in 1968 at 58.         She is survived by a son, Luke Breit of Mendocino, Calif.; a daughter, Miranda Breit of Piney River, Va.,and three grandchildren.       
         Alberta Moore Meeker, a retired executive of the National Council of Churches who lived in Sarasota, Fla., died on Sept. 3 in Sarasota Memorial Hospital. She was 70.         Mrs. Meeker died of breast cancer, said her sister, Virginia Moore of Sarasota.         Until her retirement in 1985, Mrs. Meeker had been an editor and staff associate for 15 years in the stewardship department of the National Council of Churches, in New York City. She also was a watercolorist and her large, exotically brilliant abstracts were displayed at several one-woman shows in Manhattan art galleries.         She was the widow of Oden Meeker of New York, an author, travel writer and CARE executive who died in 1976.         She is survived by her sister.       
         Marion Magid Hoagland, managing editor of Commentary magazine, died on Sept. 3 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoagland died of cancer, said her daughter, Molly Hoagland.         Mrs. Hoagland was a member of the Commentary staff for 30 years, becoming managing editor in 1968. She also wrote essays and reviews on cultural and literary subjects for that magazine and others.         She graduated from Barnard College, was a Fulbright Scholar in Berlin and was an actress and playwright in Manhattan as well as a journalist. Her marriage to Edward M. Hoagland ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter, of Manhattan, and a brother, Henry Magid of Oradell, N.J.       
         Beryl Emmer Menon, a journalist who edited the staff newspaper of Unicef, the United Nations relief organization, and who traveled and wrote widely in India and the Himalayas, died on Oct. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 50.         She had decided to discontinue kidney dialysis after 19 years of treatment, friends said.         Ms. Menon began her career as a freelance writer and photographer in Asia in the late 1960's after graduating with a journalism degree from New York University. She was a contributor to Ms. magazine, The Calcutta Statesman and The Bengali-American Reporter, taking assignments in Sikkim, Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which was then closed to outsiders by order of the Indian Government.         Indian officials began proceedings to deport Ms. Menon from Calcutta because of her violation of the travel ban, but she was allowed to remain after she married Bhaskar P. Menon, then a columnist for The Calcutta Statesman.         She returned to New York with her husband in 1970 and for the next three years worked as a reporter for The Record of Bergen County, N.J. In 1973, after learning she had kidney disease, she decided to travel again, to Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan.         In 1986, she became editor of Staff News, which is distributed to Unicef's employees around the world. She served in this position until last year.         She is survived by two brothers, William Kartel of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Ted Kartofsky of Manhattan, and a sister, Sandra Kartfel of San Francisco.       
         Dr. Dorothy Borg, a Columbia University historian of United States-East Asian relations, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her family said she had had a brief illness.         From 1966 until her retirement several years ago, Dr. Borg was a senior research associate at Columbia's East Asian Institute, lecturing and directing academic conferences. She served as a mentor to generations of scholars since the 1940's when she was associated with the American Institute of Pacific Relations.         She was the author or editor of a number of books, including "The United States and the Far Eastern Crisis, 1933-1938" (Harvard University Press, 1965), for which Columbia awarded her its Bancroft Prize in American History. Based on research in personal papers of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and high officials dealing with East Asian affairs, it chronicled events leading to Pearl Harbor, starting with Japan's invasion of Manchuria.         She was the co-editor, with Waldo Heinrichs, of "Uncertain Years: Chinese American Relations, 1947-1950" (Columbia University Press, 1980), which remains in print. Defended Targets of McCarthy         A native of Elberon, N.J., she graduated from Wellesley College and earned master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. She spent two years in Beijing and Shanghai in the 1940's as a staff member of the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         A few years later, the Institute was a target of a campaign by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy to find out "who lost China" to the Communists. Dr. Borg set aside her career for some time to help defend Owen Lattimore, the historian, and other colleagues who came under fire from the Senator.         Before she joined the institute at Columbia, she was a researcher at Harvard University where she helped organize area programs that, starting in the 1960's, trained scholars in American and East Asian history.         Dr. Borg is survived by two nephews, John Loengard of New York City and Richard Loengard of Basking Ridge, N.J.       
         Josephine Jablons, a board member of the New York City Opera Company, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69 and also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Jablons helped found the City Opera Guild in 1959 and for six years served as its president. She led it when the opera celebrated its new home at Lincoln Center with a lavish gala in 1966. She had been on the board of the City Opera since its days at City Center on West 55th Street. She was elected a director of the City Opera Company in July.         A native of Albany and a graduate of Skidmore College, Mrs. Jablons began her career in journalism and public relations. She spent 14 years as a reporter and editor of The New York Herald Tribune in Paris and in New York, covering travel, society, the arts and other subjects.         She also took part in Democratic Party affairs. She was active recently in several organizations helping immigrants.         She is survived by her husband, J. Mitchell Jablons; a daughter, Pamela Jablons of Manhattan; a son, Dr. David Jablons of San Francisco, and a sister, Grace Burke of Colonie, N.Y.
