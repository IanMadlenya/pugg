         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Mary M. Kaufman, a retired lawyer whose practice included cases involving Communism and Nazism, as well as defending the poor, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt division of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 82 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaufman retired about 1980, after having worked in Manhattan for almost all her career. Some of her other cases involved antiwar activities. She practiced mainly without partners.         In 1951, she was in a Federal courtroom as a defense lawyer when Dashiell Hammett, the writer, and W. Alphaeus Hunton, secretary of the Council on African Affairs, were convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison.         She asked Judge Sylvester Ryan to release Mr. Hunton in her custody or set bail, but he refused.         Judge Ryan had found Mr. Hammett and Mr. Hunton guilty for refusing to name contributors to the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which the Attorney General had designated as a Communist subversive front. Mrs. Kaufman's clients included the bail fund as well as Mr. Hunton.         In the preceding two years, the civil rights group had posted $500,000 or more bail for Communists accused of criminal conspiracy or involved in deportation cases, and it had forfeited more than $100,000 because of bail jumping.         In the 1940's, Mrs. Kaufman worked for the National War Labor and Wage Stabilization Boards, and she was a prosecutor at a war-crimes trial in Nuremberg.         She was born Mary Metlay in Atlanta, but grew up mainly in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, she received her law degree from St. John's University and was admitted to the bar in 1937. She became an original member of the National Lawyers Guild in that year.         Her marriage to Frederick Kaufman ended in divorce. Her second husband, Paul Albert, died last year.         Surviving are a son, Michael, of Beacon Falls, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Janice Albert of Rome and Marilyn Albert of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Renata A. Calabresi, a clinical psychologist who was active in the anti-Fascist underground in Italy in the 1930's, died last Friday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 96.         Dr. Calabresi, who was born in Ferrara, received her Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1923 and went to teach at the University of Rome. With her brother, Dr. Massimo E. Calabresi, she helped publish and distribute the leading underground newspaper of the Italian Resistance, Non Mollare (Don't Give Up) and was jailed for a time by the Mussolini Government.         She fled Italy and arrived in the United States in 1940, initially teaching  at the New School for Social Research and Hunter College. In 1947 she joined the Veterans Administration in Newark and worked as a clinical psychologist and coordinator for the training of future psychologists until her retirement in 1969.         Dr. Calabresi is survived by two nephews, Dr. Paul Calabresi of Barrington, R.I., and Judge Guido Calabresi of Woodbridge, Conn. Her brother, a former professor of medicine at Yale University, died in 1988.       
         Libby E. Sachar, who in 1946 was the first woman appointed a Superior Court judge in New Jersey, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 90.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her son, Judge Leonard Sachar of Scotch Plains, N.J.         Selected as a juvenile-domestic relations judge by Gov. Walter Edge and reappointed in 1951, she served in Union County for 10 years until she resumed her private law practice in Plainfield.         She was a 1924 graduate of the New York University School of Law and was an advocate of women's rights. In 1947, she was a member of the New Jersey Constitution Committee, which revised the state's Constitution.         In addition to her son, who is on the Superior Court bench in Union County, she is survived by a daughter, Naomi Margolies of Plainfield; a brother, Dr. Morton Bertin of Orlando, Fla., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Ellen Hermanson, a crusader in the battle against breast cancer, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 42 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         The disease was diagnosed in Ms. Hermanson in 1989, six months after the birth of her only daughter, Leora. She became actively involved in breast cancer issues by organizing survivor groups and speaking at national conferences and regional workshops.         Last November, Ms. Hermanson delivered a paper on the struggle to live with cancer pain to the annual National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship assembly in Washington. It was at this assembly that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court spoke for the first time about her own experience with breast cancer.         In 1991, Ms. Hermanson helped found the Jewish Healing Center in New York, an organization that provides spiritual assistance to people coping with serious illnesses. As editor of the center's quarterly newsletter, The Out-Stretched Arm, Ms. Hermanson published articles on breast cancer, support groups and health-care workshops. The center now has offices in New York and San Francisco.         In 1992, Judith Kaye, Chief Judge of New York State, appointed Ms. Hermanson the first executive director of the Judges and Lawyers Breast Cancer Alert. The group promotes breast cancer awareness and provides education and legal services.         Ms. Hermanson was also an active member of the national board of the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship, which provides support to cancer survivors, their friends and families and health care providers. She edited the coalition's quarterly newsletter, Networker.         Ms. Hermanson was most recently working on a project to let breast cancer survivors and their families communicate over the Internet. She was also editor of the Sloan-Kettering Annual Report.         Ms. Hermanson was born in Belmont, Mass., in 1952. She graduated from Connecticut College with honors in 1974 and received a master's degree in journalism from New York University in 1978.         She is survived by her husband, Hugo Mareno and her daughter of Manhattan; her parents, Harlow and Roslyn Hermanson of Belmont, and two sisters, Emily Hermanson Levin of Great Neck, L.I., and Julie Hermanson Ratner of New York City.         Correction:  April 13, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Hermanson, an advocate for survivors of breast cancer, misspelled her husband's name. He is Hugo Moreno, not Mareno. The obituary also misstated her residence. She lived in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The article also misstated the name of a group whose board she served on. It is the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, not the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship.
