         Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose stewardship of the Brearley School and then Barnard College made her a national role model for generations of young women who wanted to combine career and family, died on Wednesday at her home in Tyringham, Mass. She was 102.         An outspoken feminist in the 1940's and 50's before feminism became popular, Mrs. McIntosh was the first married woman to head one of the seven top women's colleges known as the Seven Sisters and became a national icon.         ''She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president, said at a gathering in 1998 at the McIntosh Student Center to mark Mrs. McIntosh's centennial birthday. She said Mrs. McIntosh, a campus legend, was a pioneer in exploring ''the struggle of both women and men to find their true roles in a changing world.''         Leora Hanser, Barnard student government president at the time of the celebration, said Mrs. McIntosh ''came from a different era, but the work and family issue is really very important, and a lot of Barnard students struggle with this today.''         In her long career, Mrs. McIntosh spoke and lectured widely, spreading ideas about women, education and child-rearing that would become popular 20 or 30 years later.         ''Having both a job and a family broadens one's perspective, which in turn makes a great contribution to a happy home life,'' she told the American Association of University Women in 1950.         She called for child care to be elevated to a dignified profession so working mothers could leave children in capable hands. And she attacked the conditioning that led young girls to feel they must subordinate their own interests when they were with boys, or to use the ''foolish technique'' of pretending they were stupid to be popular.         For anyone doubting that it could be done, Mrs. McIntosh was also the ultimate role model as she juggled marriage, five children (including twins) and her own career. Newsweek magazine viewed that as so remarkable that it put her on its cover in 1951.         But Mrs. McIntosh was less didactic than some later feminists. Even as she urged young women to participate in politics and community service and careers, she warned them that combining career and family meant pushing out nearly everything else. And she portrayed family life as a cornerstone of society and democracy, adding that in the face of conflict, family must take precedence.         ''You must be prepared to sacrifice many of your social contacts until your family is full grown,'' she said, ''and must always remember that your home comes before all else.''         She also respected the idea that happiness could come in many ways. Personal fulfillment ''may or may not lie in a career,'' she told The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. ''What is important is for each individual to order her life so that she becomes a happy, creative person.''         Her approach to life was rooted in common sense and a lack of pretense, physically and intellectually. A small, trim woman, she often wore plain suits without decoration. As a college president, she swept her own vestibule and weeded her own garden. And when she was honored after 10 years as chief of Barnard, she agreed on the condition that there be no speeches, no gifts and no flowers.         She also disliked honorifics. She preferred ''Mrs.'' to Dean and was often referred to as ''Mrs. Mac.'' When Barnard officials referred to her in news releases as ''Dr.,'' she chided them, saying, ''There is only one doctor in our family,'' referring to her husband, Dr. Rustin McIntosh, a pediatrician who taught at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.         Mrs. McIntosh saw education in its broadest sense, from conjugating irregular Greek verbs to sex education, as the way to prepare young women for the complicated balancing act she was urging on them. She believed that the education of young women for motherhood was society's ''most important task.''         At a time when few women were represented in the boardrooms of major American corporations, Mrs. McIntosh was a director of several companies, schools, foundations and civic groups.         After her retirement in 1962, she and her husband moved to their farm in Tyringham, Mass. Her husband died in 1986. Mrs. McIntosh is survived by a daughter, Susan Lloyd of Tinmouth, Vt.; 4 sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich., R. Carey, of Tyringham, Kenneth of West Newton, Mass., and J. Richard, of Boulder, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.         Millicent Carey McIntosh was born on Nov. 30, 1898, in Baltimore, the daughter of Anthony Morris Carey, who ran a machinery supply business, and the former Margaret Cheston Thomas, both active Quakers. She had five brothers and sisters, and all were taught to mend and darn and market and cook.         Her feminist notions were shaped by strong role models in her family. Her mother fought for women's suffrage, racial equality and prison reform. Her aunt, M. Carey Thomas, was a pioneer in women's education, a founder of the Bryn Mawr School (a girls' school in Baltimore) and president of Bryn Mawr College.         At Bryn Mawr, young Millicent played water polo and basketball and majored in Greek and English, graduating magna cum laude. She organized clubs for factory workers before accepting her aunt's offer of a year of study abroad.         After studying economics at Cambridge and English at Johns Hopkins University (where she did her doctoral thesis on 14th-century English mystery dramas), Mrs. McIntosh became an instructor at Bryn Mawr College. But she quickly was appointed dean of freshmen and then acting dean of the college.         She left Bryn Mawr to became headmistress at the Brearley School, the private girls school in Manhattan, from 1930 to 1947, and converted it from a half-day format to a full day. When she arrived, she asked her students to help plan the ''ideal school'' with the fewest possible rules. She worked without a desk because she felt that a desk intimated students. She introduced aptitude tests and remedial instruction and instituted a sex education course for sixth graders, which she taught.         In 1932, after she married Dr. McIntosh, her aunt discouraged her retirement, telling her, ''You can have your babies in August.'' At Brearley, she had five children. (She took to wearing academic robes to cover pregnancies.)         She was a hands-on manager, both at school and at home. She left detailed instructions for her household: menus, shopping lists, activities for the children. And every morning, she called Brearley to specify a hymn for morning assembly.         In late 1946, before Barnard had its own president (she was given the title in 1952), Mrs. McIntosh was chosen from more than 60 candidates to succeed Virginia Gildersleeve as Barnard's dean. It was a life that left few free minutes, but Mrs. McIntosh grabbed every one. She signed correspondence during intermissions at concerts and took her secretary with her to the beauty parlor so she could give dictation.         An administrator who valued good teaching, Mrs. McIntosh was dismayed that teachers were paid less than secretaries and dedicated some of Barnard's endowment for faculty salaries.         She also valued merit, and directed another part of the Barnard endowment to scholarships to open Barnard's doors to ''still more girls of superior talent regardless of their ability to pay.''         As she balanced career and home, Mrs. McIntosh acknowledged both her husband's support and good household help (which at one point included a governess, a cook and two daily helpers). She also respected the individuality of her children, keeping each in a separate school until one year, after attending five separate Christmas pageants, she said, ''I thought if I heard one more 'Silent Night' I would break down.'' Their schooling was consolidated.         At Barnard, she continued to teach: English and modern living, a required class that sought to help students think through their lives. She also presided over a $10 million fund-raising campaign.         John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rarely contributed to development funds, agreed to give Barnard $1 million, he told Mrs. McIntosh, ''because of my confidence in the exceptional vision and leadership you are bringing to the college.''         Even after she retired from Barnard, the trustees continued to consult her. In 1971, when men's and women's colleges everywhere were going coeducational and Barnard was facing pressure to merge into Columbia, Barnard's chairwoman, Eleanor Elliott, turned to Mrs. McIntosh, who suggested that the trustees try to answer three questions: Would a merger produce better education for Barnard and Columbia? Would relations between Barnard women and Columbia men be improved? And would a merger create economies for both colleges?         ''Mrs. Mac's questions helped organize our thinking simply and calmly,'' Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, ''and of course, we felt stronger.''       
         Sylvia Lawry, whose brother's incurable multiple sclerosis prompted her to found national and international organizations to fight the disease, died on Saturday at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Roosevelt Island. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lawry founded both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the United States, in 1946, and the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, in 1967. She was also one of the leaders of the effort to establish the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, in 1950.         It all began with a classified advertisement in 1945 in which Ms. Lawry beseeched readers to write her of any cures for multiple sclerosis. Instead, she got more than 50 replies asking for the same thing. Her life's mission was the result.         Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. Its onslaught is signaled by sudden neurological symptoms, including loss of vision, paralysis, numbness and difficulties in walking, as nerves lose their sheathing and are unable to conduct signals.         Partly as a result of research financed by the societies started by Ms. Lawry, scientists now suspect that the disease may be caused by a viral infection on top of an inherited genetic susceptibility, though the specific triggering mechanism remains unknown.         The national society has also helped develop medicines to alleviate symptoms and prolong life expectancy, essentially offering a normal life span to many with multiple sclerosis. In 1890, when multiple sclerosis was treated with herbs and bed rest, life expectancy was five years.  But there is still no cure for the disease, which the society says strikes another adult each hour, leaving the most afflicted paralyzed.         ''Sylvia's uncompromising battle for more than a half century to solve the mystery of multiple sclerosis made her a hero to anyone touched by this devastating disease,'' said Richard Slifka, chairman of the society.         The national society credited her with the first use of the abbreviation M.S. for the disease. The Oxford English Dictionary cites as the first use of the term a 1955 article in Science News Letter discussing work by the society.         Sylvia Friedman was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1915. Her father manufactured Venetian blinds. She graduated from Hunter College in 1936 and went to work in the office of her father's attorney as a receptionist. She hoped to go to law school and took a job in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.         In 1944, she married Michael Lawry; they were divorced two years later. She used the last name Lawry for the rest of her life, though she married Stanley Englander, who was in the wholesale meat business, in 1957. He died in 1968.         When Ms. Lawry's brother, Bernard, was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1945, she and her sister Alice placed a classified advertisement in The New York Times: ''Multiple sclerosis. Will anyone recovered from it please communicate with patient. T272 Times.''         The sisters received 54 replies from people as desperate as they were. Most asked to be informed if the two heard anything promising.         ''I was looking for medical clues that might have helped my brother,'' Ms. Lawry said in an interview with The New York Post in 1959. ''But when the responses started to snowball and come from all over the country, I decided to give up the law and let my creative energies spill over into helping M.S. victims.''         Starting with family and friends, Ms. Lawry built a network. Her sister Alice helped. Her other sister, Lillian, and her husband, Stanley Wilson, founded one of the first local chapters, in the Bronx.         Ms. Lawry is survived by Lillian Wilson, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Englander of Manhattan, and Steven Englander of Montgomery, N.Y., and two grandchildren.         The fight against multiple sclerosis grew. A tiny office was found. The doctors whom Ms. Lawry first consulted about her brother became interested in the effort.         Dee Sammak, the accounts payable manager who has worked for the society since 1954, said she has stayed all these years because of the inspiration of Ms. Lawry. ''Don't forget,'' Ms. Sammak said, ''when she started the society, women were not doing these things -- to start a society in a man's world.''         On March 11, 1946, Ms. Lawry assembled 20 prominent research scientists to found the Association for Advancement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which was renamed the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1947. Its first research grant went toward studying the relationship between the body's immune system and the effects of multiple sclerosis on the central nervous system.         Though her brother's health progressively weakened until his death in 1973, the organization Ms. Lawry founded gathered momentum. In 1950, she teamed up with Senator Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, whose daughter had multiple sclerosis, to lobby Congress for what is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.         The law creating the institute passed on Aug. 15, 1950. At that time, total federal appropriations for research on multiple sclerosis were $14,000. They now total $100 million a year, the society said.         Ms. Lawry's political skills were evident throughout her career. A frequent tactic, she told CNN in 1995, was to lobby people who had relatives or acquaintances with the disease. She mentioned winning support from President John F. Kennedy, who had a cousin with the disease, and Grace Kelly, whose first fiancé had it.         The international organization was born after the national society realized it was giving almost one-third of its research grants to foreigners. There are now 38 societies around the world.         Ms. Lawry, who worked 12-hour days, said she would never retire until multiple sclerosis retired. The disease still affects 1 in 1,000 people in the United States.         ''There was a continuing pain in her heart, because what she really wanted to see was M.S. go the way of polio,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a society spokeswoman.       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Pauline Koner, one of the eclectic individualists of contemporary American dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         A choreographer noted for powerful solos, Miss Koner was also a principal dancer with the José Limón Dance Company, a leading modern-dance troupe of the 1940's and 50's. Stylistically versatile, she contributed to early television dance, taught dance around the world and choreographed stage shows at the Roxy Theater in New York and several ice revues. Although usually categorized as a modern dancer, she was fond of saying, ''I never had a modern-dance lesson in my life.''         She was born in New York in 1912,  the daughter of immigrants from Russia. Her father, Samuel Koner, a lawyer, had devised a medical plan for the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish socialist and benevolent organization; the result is considered a pioneering group medical plan.         Interested in the arts, Miss Koner wanted to study ballet with Michel Fokine, the most important balletic reformer of the early 20th century.  Her family considered his fees exorbitant, so her father offered his legal services free to Fokine in exchange for ballet lessons for young Pauline.         Miss Koner also studied Spanish dance and worked with Michio Ito and Yeichi Nimura, Japanese choreographers who blended Asian dance with Western modern dance.         Discussing her training in her autobiography, ''Solitary Song'' (Duke University Press, 1989), Miss Koner said she derived her speed and precision from ballet, her smoothness in covering space from Asian dance and her rhythm and dynamics from Spanish dance.         She presented her first solo concert on Dec. 7, 1930, and John Martin, then the dance critic for The New York Times, said that the event ''exhibited her unquestionable right to stand alone.'' He added, ''She can build a dance far better than the average, she can perform it with complete authority.''         Miss Koner toured Egypt and Palestine in 1932 and taught and performed in the Soviet Union from 1934 to 1936. Her solos then included  works on biblical themes, the ''Suite of Soviet Impressions,'' the satirical ''Three Funeral Marches'' and dances in Spanish and Arabian styles.         Miss Koner's career often took unexpected turns. In the early 40's she created dances for the Roxy and for ''Holiday on Ice.'' She began to choreograph for CBS television in 1945, experimenting with effects that only a camera could produce.         The most important change in her artistic development came that year  when, after a solo concert, she received a note from Doris Humphrey, the legendary American modern dance pioneer.         Humphrey praised the program, yet added criticism that Miss Koner found so perceptive that she sought out Humphrey and asked her to be her adviser, her ''outside eye,'' as she called her. Thereafter, Miss Koner would submit all her new choreography to Humphrey for comment. ''Our work together was a continuous revelation,'' she wrote in her autobiography, and added that after Humphrey's death in 1958: ''She inhabits me. She is my dybbuk.''         Martin declared in The Times in 1955 that, by working with Humphrey, Miss Koner ''has arrived at her true fulfillment'' and that the decision to ally herself with a mentor ''was an act of high artistic insight.'' Miss Koner honored Humphrey's memory in 1962 with ''The Farewell,'' an elegiac 30-minute solo that became her best-known piece of choreography.         Humphrey served as the artistic adviser to the Limón company and she and Limón asked Miss Koner to perform with the troupe. As a result, she became what she termed ''a permanent guest artist'' with the company from 1946 to 1960, creating roles in such major works as Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' (1949) and Humphrey's ''Ruins and Visions'' (1953).         At the same time, she choreographed for herself and other dancers with productions ranging in tone from ''Cassandra'' (1953), a warning against hysteria, to the gracious ''Concertino'' (1955). From 1976 to 1982 she headed the Pauline Koner Dance Consort.         Petite, with dark hair and eyes,  Miss Koner riveted audiences with her intensity. She designed many of her stage costumes and was always strikingly dressed offstage. Reviewing a Limón concert for Dance magazine in 1955, the critic Doris Hering wrote that ''Pauline Koner was like some fiery bacchante as she tore through leaps and sharp shifts in direction.''         Yet however spontaneous her dancing may have seemed, Miss Koner believed that the principles of stage presence and theatrical magnetism could be learned. She became famous for Elements of Performing, a course she taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts, the American Dance Festival and other schools in the United States, Europe and Asia. The course analyzed such facets of a performance as motivation, emotion, focus, dynamics and the use of props, fabrics, lights and sound.         Miss Koner was married to the conductor Fritz Mahler from 1939 until his death in 1973. She received a Dance Magazine Award in 1964 and wrote for many dance publications.         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  February 12, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the dancer Pauline Koner on Friday referred incorrectly to the José Limón Dance Company, in which she was a principal in the 1940's and 50's. It remains a leading modern-dance company; its prominence was not limited to those decades.       
         Peggy Converse, a character actress whose seven-decade career in show business included films, television and more than 100 roles in more than 1,000 theaters, died on March 2 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 95.         Ms. Converse said she had appeared on stages in every major city in the United States and Canada and ''in most of the towns in between, any town that had a stage and would have me.''         She made the comment at 85 when she was paid for what became her final performance, a recorded scream that she said she had actually emitted for the 1958 low-budget thriller ''The Thing That Couldn't Die'' and that caught the ear of the producers of a new horror film.         ''The producers could not find anyone to scream the way they wanted, so they went back to the dark ages of film and heard mine,'' she said. ''You would have screamed that way, too, if you were in movies like that.''         Anyway, on the basis of hearing the recorded scream, the new producers decided, ''She's the one.''         Then they found out that Ms. Converse was 85. ''They, of course, realized they couldn't use me, so they used my voice,'' she said.         Besides screaming, Ms. Converse applied her talents to portraying leading ladies, ingénues, mothers, sisters and villains.         Her film career included roles in everything from ''Father Is a Bachelor'' (1950), with William Holden, and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), with Rita Hayworth, to ''The Accidental Tourist'' (1988), with Geena Davis and William Hurt.         Active in television from its infancy, Ms. Converse appeared in numerous episodes of ''Perry Mason'' with Raymond Burr, and on soap operas like ''The Young and the Restless,'' ''General Hospital'' and ''Days of Our Lives.''         Born in Oregon City, Ore., she began her career at 16, appearing as multiple characters in the ''Pilgrimage Play'' in Los Angeles. A 1927 graduate of Stanford University, she was a sought-after ingénue in the 1920's and 30's, appearing in Broadway productions like ''Infernal Machine,'' with Lloyd Bridges, and ''Comedy of Good and Evil,'' with Mildred Dunnock.         Ms. Converse played feature roles in plays like ''Othello,'' ''Wuthering Heights,'' ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' in summer stock companies from Tarrytown, N.Y., and Weston, Conn., to Santa Fe, N.M., and Carmel, Calif. She and her husband, the actor Don Porter, appeared together in the national touring companies of ''Any Wednesday,'' ''The Best Man'' and ''Love and Kisses.''         Her first marriage, to Edmund Converse, founder of Bonanza Airlines, ended in divorce.         She and Mr. Porter, whom she met at a cast party at the Carmel Playhouse, were married for 53 years. He died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter, the actress and singer Melissa Converse, and a son, Don Porter Jr., both of Los Angeles; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Debra E. Bernhardt, a labor historian who spearheaded a successful three-year drive to obtain landmark status for Union Square Park in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said her sister, Andra Bernhardt Ladd.         The head of the Tamiment Library and the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University, Dr. Bernhardt devoted her career to documenting the lives of the largely unsung men and women who built New York City and, day in and day out, nudged it along: sandhogs and seamstresses, pipe fitters and child welfare workers, secretaries and short-order cooks.         She was the author, with Rachel Bernstein, of ''Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives'' (New York University Press, 2000), a book of photographs and oral histories of working New Yorkers that grew out of an exhibition of the same name at the Museum of the City of New York.         At her death, Dr. Bernhardt was at work on Labor Arts, a Web site devoted to the art and artifacts of working people, scheduled to make its debut in May.         As a public historian, Dr. Bernhardt immersed herself in the kinds of workaday narratives that traditional academic historians, with their eyes trained on the powerful, often overlook. She described her work as ''documenting the undocumented,'' a phrase that neatly encapsulated the particular challenge of public history: how to chronicle the lives of people not in the habit of generating collections of personal papers, boxed and ready for posterity.         But what these people did have was stuff -- leaflets, lapel buttons, picket signs and photographs -- and part of Dr. Bernhardt's job was to persuade them that each of these dusty artifacts was a window on a bygone union election, organizing drive or strike; she would acquire many of them for the Tamiment Library, a research collection devoted to radical movements in the United States from the Civil War onward, as well as for the Wagner Archives, dedicated to labor studies.         ''The dustbin of history is lighter because of her,'' said Miriam Frank, a colleague at N.Y.U.         Debra Ellen Bernhardt was born on May 9, 1953, in Nuremberg, West Germany, where her parents were civilian employees of the United States Army; she was raised in Iron River, Mich., where several members of her Danish-American family worked in the iron mines. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, a master's from Wayne State University and, in 1988, one of the first doctorates from N.Y.U. in public history.         In conjunction with her dissertation, she produced ''New Yorkers at Work,'' an eight-part series broadcast on National Public Radio. In 1995, Dr. Bernhardt received the John Commerford Award, the highest honor of the New York Labor History Association, and, this year, the Distinguished Service Award from the New York City Central Labor Council.         Dr. Bernhardt is survived by her sister, of Lafayette, La.; her parents, Harold and Marcia Bernhardt, of Iron River; and by her husband, Jonathan Bloom, and her children, Alexander and Sonia, all of Brooklyn.         Despite her professional prominence, Dr. Bernhardt remained intensely proud of her own working-class roots. She sang in the New York City Labor Chorus; her business cards bore the logo of the union shop that printed them, as did her son's bar mitzvah invitations. She was known to her friends as Debs -- shorthand not only for Debra, but also for Eugene V.         And it was largely as a result of Dr. Bernhardt's efforts that in September 1998, Union Square Park was declared a national historic landmark by the National Park Service. The square was the cradle of American labor history -- a perennial home to anarchists, Communists, socialists, unionists and assorted rabble-rousing orators, and the site, in 1882, of what was later recognized as the first Labor Day parade.         ''No one realizes that the eight-hour day was won by working people on these streets, in this park,'' Dr. Bernhardt told The New York Times in 1998, as she sat in Union Square, once ringed by union halls and threadbare left-wing publishers and now by upscale restaurants and chain retailers. ''We wanted to celebrate the fact that ordinary people were able to express their rights to free speech and assembly on this spot.''       
         Eleanor Clymer, who in dozens of children's books contrasted country and city life, died yesterday at a retirement community in Haverford, Pa. She was 95.         Between 1943 and 1983, Mrs. Clymer published 58 books, mostly for elementary schoolchildren. Her first, ''A Yard for John,'' which told of a city boy who so longs to play in the mud and grass that his family moves to the suburbs, was praised in The New York Times as a story of reality ''touched with magic.'' In ''The Trolley Car Family'' (1947), a man who loses his job as a street car driver turns his old trolley into a home for his family and moves it to the country.         But Mrs. Clymer also explored the lives of children who stay in the city in books like ''My Brother Stevie'' (1967), about a troubled third grader,  and ''The Tiny Little House'' (1964), inspired by a small house that she saw squeezed between two tall buildings in Manhattan. The story was later adapted into a musical for children, ''The Little House of Cookies.''         Whether set in the city or the country, Mrs. Clymer's stories were grounded in reality, despite a children's book industry enthralled with fantasy. ''No 'Star Wars' and dungeons or dragons and fairy tales,'' she said firmly of her writing in an interview in 1984.         One book, ''Hamburgers -- and Ice Cream for Dessert'' (1975), about a boy searching for food on a desert island, was inspired by her son, Adam, who for a time as a child would eat for dinner only hamburgers, mashed potatoes and peas, and ice cream. Adam Clymer, her only survivor, is now the Washington correspondent of The Times.         Mrs. Clymer originally wanted to be a science writer, and several of her books sought to teach children about subjects like archaeology.         ''She always came up with an interesting idea which no one else had done,'' said Ann Durell, the former publisher of children's books at Dutton, who edited Mrs. Clymer.         Eleanor Lowenton was born in New York City on Jan. 7, 1906, to Russian immigrant parents. She spent most of her life in New York, but in an essay in the ''Something About the Author Autobiography Series'' in 1994, she fondly recalled how she explored the land around her family's tarpaper-covered summer home in New Jersey, and how disappointed she was when her parents had to give up plans to live there permanently because her father could not find a job. The yearning for the country, she said, ''was to influence all our lives.''         After earning a degree in English from the University of Wisconsin in 1928, and marrying Kinsey Clymer, a journalist who became a social worker, she tried to return to country life. She and her family put a down payment on a farm and began repairs, but finances again got in the way, and the Clymers returned to the city.         After taking a workshop at the Bank Street School, Mrs. Clymer decided to try writing for the young.         ''I wanted to tell stories to little children, like my own son and his friends who were beginning to find their way in the everyday world of family, play, work, pets, familiar things that they experienced and understood,'' she recalled.         For the next few decades, she did just that, sometimes so prolifically that she published under pseudonyms so that she would not appear to be competing with herself.         Finally, after their son was grown, the Clymers realized their dream of a country house. In the early 1960's they moved to Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, where Mr. Clymer died in 1984, and Mrs. Clymer lived until 1989.       
         Helen Oakley Dance, a journalist and historian of jazz and blues, as well as a record producer, music publisher and personal assistant to musicians like Duke Ellington, Red Norvo, Chick Webb, Johnny Hodges, Bob Crosby and Earl Hines, died on Sunday in Escondido, Calif. She was 88.         Ms. Dance -- who often worked  with her husband, the jazz historian and record producer Stanley Dance -- began as a pioneering female jazz critic in the 1930's but soon began to play a role in exposing a wider American audience to jazz. She insisted on taking the music seriously, and from the start, as a habitué of the swing ballrooms, she distinguished herself from the jitterbuggers by watching from the sidelines.         During that decade, she wrote jazz reviews for Downbeat and other publications, worked for the management organizations of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong and promoted and booked Chick Webb's touring band. She also produced records for the Okeh label and organized the well-promoted swing-band battles at the Savoy Ballroom in New York, which became legendary events.         In 1935, as head of the Chicago Rhythm Club, a fan organization that  booked concerts, she persuaded Benny Goodman to hire the pianist Teddy Wilson, and to bring Goodman's group to play in April 1936 at the  Congress Hotel in Chicago. The event broke ground because it featured an interracial band and because it was one of the earliest American presentations of jazz in a sit-down performance hall. And while working for Irving Mills, Ellington's manager, she sold him on the idea of forming small bands within Ellington's larger orchestra. She soon become the head of artists and repertory for Variety records, which issued a series of recordings by these small bands.         Born in Toronto to a well-to-do family, Ms. Dance attended Ovenden and Trinity Colleges in Toronto and a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In the early 1930's she traveled to London, where she first saw  Ellington perform. Soon after, she rebelled against her family by moving to Detroit, where she intended to work as a jazz singer and later met  Ellington by forging an introductory note to him from a jazz critic. But by 1934 she moved to Chicago and found work writing about and helping to produce jazz concerts. She became a regular contributor to the new Downbeat magazine and was one of the organizers of the famous 1937 Goodman concert at Carnegie Hall.         In 1942 she volunteered for the Women's Army Corps and was assigned to Algiers, where she sent undercover operatives and radio technicians to occupied zones. Later in the war she trained renegade German soldiers as American spies.         Soon after the war she married Mr. Dance, whom she originally met while working for Mills, and they began their 50-year collaboration on  articles, histories and record productions. The family moved to Rowayton, Conn., and from 1964 to 1982, while her husband managed Hines, Ms. Dance ran Hicue, the music publishing company for Hines and Hodges. She also conducted interviews with jazz musicians for the Smithsonian Institution and Rutgers University. In 1971 she wrote ''Stormy Monday'' (Lightning Press), a biography of the blues musician Aaron (T-Bone) Walker.         Ms. Dance also worked in the civil rights movement, founding the Catholic Interracial Council within the Roman Catholic diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., and the Human Relations Commission in Norwalk, Conn.         In 1988 the Helen Oakley Dance and Stanley Dance Archive was established at Yale University, encompassing correspondence, writings, interviews, records, photographs and films; it will become available to researchers later this year. An oral history interview with Ms. Dance, conducted by Patricia Willard, a jazz historian, is part of the Ellington Collection at the National Museum of American History in Washington.         Mr. Dance died in February 1999.         Ms. Dance is survived by sons  Francis, of Woodbury, Conn., and Rupert, of Hopkinton, N.H.; daughters Theresa Bennink-Dance of Peterborough, Ontario, and Maria Lindley of Carlsbad, Calif.; sisters Jacqueline Hickson of New Smyrna Beach, Fla., and Doris Barry of Wilton, Conn.;  brother John Gillespie of Toronto; and three grandchildren.         ''The affinity with jazz which has determined my life was not inherited,'' she told the writer Sally Placksin in the book ''Jazzwomen.'' ''It was a gift. For the record, I was never really career-minded. My priorities were reversed, because I wasn't that hungry for gold. All my feel was for the music and the people who played things you wanted to hear.''       
         Erin O'Reilly, a New York City police sergeant who helped orchestrate the downfall of two entrenched Harlem drug gangs by using a new legal approach, died last Sunday at a Long Island hospital. She was 41 and lived in North Babylon, N.Y.         The Suffolk County medical examiner's office did not release the cause of death, but a New York City Police Department spokesman said it was nothing suspicious. Sergeant O'Reilly had a history of high blood pressure.         In January, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik named Sergeant O'Reilly head of a new conspiracy unit in recognition of her leadership in making arrests on a novel legal premise: that local gangs operate shrewdly managed, almost corporate operations to sell drugs in thousands of transactions so small that individually they constitute only minor felonies, but that taken together they amount to a criminal conspiracy.         She and the officers and prosecutors working with her combined extensive research from official records, interviews and other sources to bring charges against gang kingpins who had proved invulnerable to the standard tactic of arresting street dealers and persuading them to betray their bosses, and so on up the ladder.         These more sophisticated drug operations were conducted indoors, not on street corners, and the thousands of street dealers making small sales were deliberately given no information to trade for lighter sentences. ''You'd just keep arresting them forever,'' said Bridget G. Brennan, the city's special narcotics prosecutor.         In an interview in the June 11 issue of New York magazine, Sergeant O'Reilly said: ''They knew the law as well as we knew the law. They were not greedy. We like people to get greedy, because greedy people make mistakes. And that's one of the things with this group: They don't make mistakes.''         But the dealers made the mistake of offending Sergeant O'Reilly. She told The Daily News in April: ''They'd taunt us, they'd smirk, they would think they were untouchable. But I'm stubborn.''         In June 1998, after earlier success in dismantling a drug operation at the Castle Hotel at 106th Street and Central Park West, she was assigned to take on the Black Top gang, named for the color of the caps on their crack vials.         Black Top worked out of two connected apartment houses at 12-14 and 16-18 Old Broadway, which is between 125th and 126th Streets. The gang effectively sealed the building from the police by dead-bolting entrances and posting lookouts. The building overlooked the precinct house, which further aided the criminals.         Inside, dealers on the higher floors sat on milk crates selling crack. During police raids, they disappeared into apartments they had either rented or commandeered.         After aborted raids and other stops and starts, last July Sergeant O'Reilly called together a group that included members of several police units and prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office. The group decided to take the novel step of applying conspiracy laws previously used mainly against the Mafia.         In the drug operations, Sergeant O'Reilly saw what clearly seemed a structured business.         ''They had shifts, there was a set scale of who got paid what whenever you were a lookout, whether you were an actual dealer that handed drugs to people, whether you were a runner, whether you were a cooker,'' she said in the New York interview.         Last Nov. 2, nearly 140 officers converged on the Black Top stronghold, making 24 arrests. Using the same strategy, Sergeant O'Reilly dismantled another organization, the Watson Gang, which had overrun two buildings on West 129th Street. Two charged as leaders and 21 said to be underlings were arrested. Those cases have not yet gone to trial.         Commissioner Kerik, who named Sergeant O'Reilly to head the new conspiracy unit in January, said in a statement after her death, ''Fighting drug traffickers demands courage, dedication and tenacity, and in Sgt. Erin O'Reilly, you had all three qualities.''         Erin O'Reilly was born on Feb. 27, 1960, in the Bronx and was raised in Bergen County, N.J. Her father, John J. O'Reilly Sr., was a New York State highway patrolman who did ''everything to keep me from becoming a police officer,'' Sergeant O'Reilly recalled, adding, ''I'm sure he saw his share of things he didn't want his daughter to see.''         But she said she wanted to make a difference, and joined the force. Her first assignment was in Washington Heights, at the height of the crack epidemic. ''New York was the O.K. Corral,'' she said. But she loved being a police officer, and liked to pepper her speech with expressions from the television show ''Dragnet.'' Ms. Brennan said she sometimes worked 36 hours straight.         Ms. O'Reilly is survived by her father, who lives in Jackson, Miss.; her brother, John J. O'Reilly Jr., of Mahwah, N.J.; and her companion, Andrea Abruzzo.       
         Katharine Graham, who transformed The Washington Post from a mediocre newspaper into an American institution and, in the process, transformed herself from a shy widow into a publishing legend, died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a fall on a sidewalk on Saturday in Idaho. She was 84.         Mrs. Graham had been attending a business conference in Sun Valley. She was flown to a hospital in Boise, where she underwent brain surgery but never recovered consciousness, her son Donald E. Graham said.         Mrs. Graham was one of the most powerful figures in American journalism and, for the last decades of her life, at the pinnacle of Washington's political and social establishments, a position this insecure wife and mother never imagined she would, or could, occupy.         It was only after she succeeded her father and her husband as president and later publisher of The Washington Post, a newspaper with a modest circulation and more modest reputation, that it moved into the front rank of American newspapers, reaching new heights when its unrelenting reporting of the Watergate scandal contributed to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.         Mrs. Graham's courage in supporting her reporters and editors through the long investigation was critical to its success. Three years before Watergate, she gave solid backing to The New York Times in a historic confrontation with the government when she permitted her editors to join in publishing the secret revelations about the war in Vietnam known as the Pentagon Papers.         Mrs. Graham would have been the first to say the single greatest decision of her professional career was not in publishing the Pentagon Papers nor in exposing the Watergate scandal but in hiring Benjamin C. Bradlee to be her editor. With her support he forged a staff of reporters and editors that made The Washington Post a force in the capital and in the world of journalism.         Mrs. Graham capped her career when she was 80 years old in 1998 by winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography for her often painful reminiscence, ''Personal History'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Nora Ephron, in her review of the best-selling memoir in The New York Times Book Review, wrote of Mrs. Graham, ''The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.''         Mrs. Graham was a socialite mother of four when her husband, Philip L. Graham, committed suicide in 1963. Her father had given Mr. Graham control of The Post and when the latter died, his widow found herself in a mysterious thicket of corporate politics dominated by men unaccustomed to a woman in the boardroom and highly skeptical of her ability to run a newspaper.         Mrs. Graham saw herself at best as only as an interim caretaker who would try to hold on to The Post for her children. She became something quite different -- the effective steward of a multimillion-dollar communications empire.         ''It's sort of like a fairy tale,'' Mrs. Graham said on being told of her Pulitzer Prize. But her life was its own sort of fairy tale.         She was born in New York City on June 16, 1917. Her father, Eugene Meyer, made his fortune on Wall Street, became a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, went on to organize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and was appointed the first president of the World Bank. Her mother, the former Agnes Ernst, was a tall, self-absorbed woman of intellectual and artistic ambition. She was scathingly critical and often harsh with her daughter, the fourth of five children.         The children were brought up in the traditions of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, the church of presidents, where the Meyers -- Mr. Meyer was Jewish, his wife Lutheran -- had their own pew. Mrs. Graham remembered a lonely childhood in palatial houses in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and in Washington. Her father was often away working, her mother traveling and writing  letters home about her social conquests.         In the absence of maternal warmth and support, Katharine became attached to her governess. Later, she went to the Madeira School for Girls in Virginia. She spent two years at Vassar before transferring to the University of Chicago. Neither of her parents attended her graduation in 1938.         When Katharine was 16, no one thought to tell her that her father had bid $825,000 at public auction to buy the bankrupt Washington Post, a paper with a circulation of 50,000 that was losing a million dollars a year, the fifth newspaper in a five-newspaper town. Later, with yearnings of her own to get into journalism, she took a job at The San Francisco News before going to The Post to work on the editorial page and handle letters to the editor. ''If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of her,'' her father said.         'The Tail to His Kite'         Washington, in 1939, was full of young people converging on the capital to work for The New Deal. Among them was Philip L. Graham of Florida, a brilliant lawyer and a clerk at the Supreme Court, first for Justice Stanley Reed and then for Felix Frankfurter. Shy and insecure, Katharine Meyer could not believe her luck when he asked her to marry him. The heiress agreed to his terms -- that they return to Florida and his father's dairy business, provided, she remembered, that ''I could live with only two dresses because I had to understand that he would never take anything from my father or be involved with him and we would live on what he made.''         It did not work out that way, and Mr. Graham soon accepted his father-in-law's invitation to join The Post. He became associate publisher at 30 and publisher at 31. Mr. Meyer also arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his daughter because, he explained to her, ''no man should be in the position of working for his wife.'' Mrs. Graham did not object because she knew how important it was to her father to keep The Post in the family, and, she wrote, ''in those days, of course, the only possible heir would have been a male.''         Mrs. Graham was belittled and silenced by a husband she adored, the man she called ''the fizz'' in her life. When he drank too much, gave vent to his rage or frequently became ill, she attributed it to the pressure of his work and not to a serious emotional affliction that had not yet been identified.         ''Our relationship resembled that of a chief executive officer Phil and a chief operating officer me,'' Mrs. Graham wrote in her memoir. In addition to handling all domestic matters, she paid all their living expenses from her own trust fund so her husband could pay back the debt he incurred buying even more Post stock.         Mr. Graham was immersed in building up The Washington Post, conducting negotiations to buy the rival Times-Herald and merging it with his paper, and waging political battles as The Post took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his brand of anti-communism. Later Mr. Graham became an even more influential figure in Washington, a close friend of President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.         ''I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,'' Mrs. Graham wrote.         Mr. Graham had his first breakdown in 1957. His recovery was slow, but he eventually re-emerged into Washington life. In 1961, at the urging of Mr. Bradlee, then a young reporter at Newsweek, he negotiated the purchase of the weekly newsmagazine. He also added television stations to the company's holdings.         What his wife later described as his ''hyperactivity, rage and irrationality'' grew. Mrs. Graham was shattered when she discovered that her husband was having an affair with a Newsweek employee. But there was an added blow: she discovered he had a scheme to pay her off and take ownership of The Post, in which he already had controlling interest because her father had given him the majority of Class A shares.         But she decided to fight back. She resolved not to give her husband a divorce unless he gave up enough controlling stock in the Post to give her majority interest.         Mr. Graham became increasingly ill and was in and out of a mental hospital. Finally, his illness had a name, manic depression. The kinds of drugs that were later developed for his condition were not available then, and Mr. Graham, on the advice of his psychiatrist, refused such drugs that were in use. In August 1963, while on a weekend leave from the hospital, Philip Graham, then 48 years old, took one of his hunting rifles and shot himself to death at their farm in Virginia.         Holding On to The Post         As she mourned, the 46-year-old widow sought ways to hold on to The Post until her sons were old enough to run it. (Her daughter was not a candidate in her plan.) Mrs. Graham wrote that she was startled when her friend Luvie Pearson, the wife of the columnist Drew Pearson, told her to run the paper herself. ''Don't be silly, dear. You can do it,'' Mrs. Pearson told her. ''You've got all those genes. . . . You've just been pushed down so far you don't recognize what you can do.''         Mrs. Graham met with the directors of The Post a month after her husband's death and told them that the paper would not be sold and that it would remain in the family. She was elected president of the company, but she felt ''abysmally ignorant'' about how to proceed.         She said she was embarrassed to talk to her own reporters, timid in dealing with the paper's executives and uncomfortable with balance sheets. Both at The Post and in the wider journalistic community, Mrs. Graham was usually the only woman at meetings and dinners. The men hardly knew what to make of her.         Although she had absorbed a great deal over the years from both her father and her husband, she did not feel up to the job as she tried to learn from the top. With the advice and support of friends like the columnists Walter Lippmann and James Reston, she began to feel some level of comfort at The Post, but she still felt shaky at Newsweek, where she went through a series of hirings and firings that some staff members recall as creating havoc at the magazine.         Two years after taking over The Post, she hired Mr. Bradlee, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, to be deputy managing editor and then quickly moved him up to executive editor. They made a formidable team, propelling The Post into one of its most dynamic periods. With Mrs. Graham's backing, Mr. Bradlee forged a staff of reporters and editors and put out a breezy, gutsy paper that investigated government with gusto. A saucy, impertinent Style section appeared that would soon be imitated by competitors but never matched.         Mr. Bradlee's brassy style galvanized his staff and invigorated his publisher.         'The Most Powerful Woman'         As Mrs. Graham struggled to take hold at The Post, she slowly started putting her personal life together. Truman Capote gave what could only be called a coming-out party for her, the Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York, which was not only  the social event of the 1966 season, but also a masked ball of such glamour that it is considered one of the legendary parties of the 20th century.         She wrote, ''For one magic night I was transformed.''         Mrs. Graham's memoir quoted Gerald Clarke, one of Mr. Capote's biographers, as saying: ''She was arguably the most powerful woman in the country, but still largely unknown outside Washington. Putting her in the spotlight was also his ultimate act as Pygmalion. It would symbolize her emergence from her dead husband's shadow; she would become her own woman before the entire world.''         In 1969, and still with considerable trepidation, Mrs. Graham added the title of publisher to her position as president of the Washington Post Company.         In June 1971, The New York Times started publishing the secret history of decision-making during the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. After a few days, a federal judge put The Times under a temporary restraining order, the first time in American history that such an order of prior restraint had been imposed.         The editors and reporters at The Post scrambled to get their own copy of the Pentagon Papers. There was a crisis atmosphere, for at the same time the Washington Post Company was in the process of being taken public, raising concerns that the company could face harsh retribution from federal regulators if it published the Pentagon Papers while The New York Times was enjoined. When The Post obtained its own copy, it was left to Mrs. Graham, as publisher, to decide whether to risk publication.         The editors and reporters urged her to publish the papers, but the lawyers suggested waiting, fearing the whole company -- its newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations -- was at stake. Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go. Let's publish.' ''         At the Supreme Court, the Times and Post cases were heard together, and the justices voted, 6 to 3, on June 30, 1971, against restraining publication of the Pentagon Papers on the ground of endangering national security. That vote is considered a major triumph for freedom of the press.         Mr. Bradlee called the publication of the Pentagon Papers a key moment in the life of the newspaper. ''It was just sort of the graduation of The Post into the highest ranks,'' he said. ''One of our unspoken goals was to get the world to refer to The Post and New York Times in the same breath, which they previously hadn't done. After the Pentagon Papers, they did.''         In a statement yesterday, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, said:         ''We are deeply saddened by the passing of Katharine Graham, a close friend and honored colleague. She will be remembered as a truly remarkable woman, who had a profound effect on the course of events, both at home and abroad. Throughout the last half of the 20th century, she used her intelligence, her courage and her wit to transform the landscape of American journalism, and everyone who cares about a free and impartial press will greatly miss her. We certainly will.''         Weathering Watergate         On June 17, 1972, five months before Nixon's re-election, five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex. The Post began an intense investigation that eventually connected the break-in to the White House.         In the face of intimidation by the Nixon administration, The Post relentlessly published front-page articles by two little-known reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and complemented them with editorials and Herblock cartoons. It eventually proved that what the Nixon administration characterized as a ''third-rate burglary'' was, instead, a scheme directed from the White House to illegally gather intelligence on the Democratic Party, discredit opponents of the administration and subvert the democratic political process.         The Post was alone on reporting Watergate for so long that Mrs. Graham was constantly asking herself, ''If this is such a hell of a story, then where is everybody else?''         In the course of the paper's investigation, the licenses of two of the company's television stations were challenged. Mrs. Graham was advised never to be alone and was also threatened with unspecified retaliation if The Post published an article that said John Mitchell, when he was attorney general, controlled a secret fund that was used to spy on the Democrats. Mr. Mitchell memorably  warned Mr. Bernstein that ''Katie Graham'' would have a breast ''caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.'' Bob Woodward later presented Mrs. Graham with an old-fashioned wooden laundry wringer, which she kept in her office ever after.         At the beginning of the next year the Watergate burglars pleaded guilty, and one of them, hoping to get a more lenient sentence, wrote to John J. Sirica, a federal district judge, to inform him that perjury had been committed and that higher-ups were behind the break-in. That letter vindicated the time and space The Post had devoted to the scandal. For its Watergate reporting, the newspaper was awarded the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.         Meanwhile, the Senate began investigating the scandal and a special prosecutor was appointed. In April 1973, Nixon accepted some responsibility. But in July, it was disclosed that a taping system in the Oval Office had recorded his every word. The tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover-up. He resigned in August 1974.         Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Without the tapes, the true story would never have emerged. In fact, I believe that we at The Post were really saved in the end by the tapes and the lucky chance that they weren't destroyed.''         Meeting the Elite         In time, as Mrs. Graham became more comfortable with her ability to exercise power, she took trips to confer with foreign leaders, usually accompanied by one of the reporters and her friend Meg Greenfield, who was editor of the editorial page of The Post and a columnist for Newsweek. Mrs. Graham liked to tell the story of her visit to a village in the Ivory Coast where the chief exclaimed what an honor it was to have with them the 17th most important person in the world, a description that she said he had apparently picked up from a poll that had appeared in U.S. News & World Report.         In Washington she started to entertain the political elite at her home in Georgetown and an invitation from her came to be seen as second only to an invitation to the White House.         President Bush recalled in a statement yesterday how Mrs. Graham had welcomed him and his wife, Laura, to Washington with a dinner at her home, as she had with other presidents. He called her ''a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others.''         The ''A'' list of the world attended her parties. By the time of her 70th birthday, she had become so powerful a figure that Art Buchwald said in his toast at her party, ''There is one word that brings us all together here tonight. And that word is 'fear.' ''         With the help of the women's movement, and particularly through discussions with Gloria Steinem, Mrs. Graham said she became more cognizant of the causes of her own insecurities and more aware of the problems of working women. She played a signal role in changing Washington mores when it became widely known that on one evening after dinner, she had refused to join the ladies upstairs while the men discussed world affairs over brandy and cigars. And  more women were added to the staffs of both The Post and Newsweek, partly because Mrs. Graham came to understand it was necessary, partly as a result of lawsuits, and partly because of a new climate throughout the country.         Over the years, she found a little time for a personal life. She was courted by a number of men, among them Adlai E. Stevenson after his failed runs for the presidency. She enjoyed weekends at her homes in Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, often in the company of her grandchildren.         Besides her son Donald, she is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Weymouth, known as Lally; her sons William and Stephen; a sister, Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         The funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday at the National Cathedral in Washington.         The Business of News         Mrs. Graham's resolve on editorial questions often contrasted with indecisiveness on business matters. In the 1970's, she acknowledged in her book, she hired and dismissed top executives at Newsweek, the newspaper division and the Washington Post Company too frequently.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Graham and her associates tried to make the Washington Post Company more profitable. Newsweek took the lead among news magazines in increasing subscription and newsstand prices. But holding down costs at The Washington Post led to a bitter confrontation with the mechanical unions.         The clash came in October 1975, when the newspaper's pressmen went on strike after contract talks broke down. As the pressmen, members of Local 6 of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, began their walkout, all 72 of the newspaper's presses were vandalized.         Although the paper failed to publish on the first day, a truncated issue appeared the next day. In the face of threats from the striking workers and occasional physical attacks, the reporters voted to stay on the job. Executives handled the classified advertising department, the mailroom and even the presses when they were repaired. Helicopters landed on the roof of The Post building to ferry copy to presses in Maryland and Virginia. It took nearly a month to repair the presses, but The Post continued to appear.         Mrs. Graham not only went on to win the battle of automation of her newspaper, but also to have the final word on a competitor, the financially troubled Washington Star.  The Post had 75 percent of the city's advertising linage by 1981, and The Star was forced to close. By the end of 1981, The Post's daily circulation had soared to 984,000 from 771,000.         Donald Graham succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979 and chief executive of the company in 1991, a company which by then was valued at nearly $2 billion. Mrs. Graham stepped down as chairwoman of the board in 1993, again to be succeeded by her son, but remained on the board as chairwoman of the executive committee.         Mrs. Graham served on the board of The Associated Press, and was chairwoman and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. and a trustee of George Washington University, the University of Chicago and the Urban Institute.         Finally, she seemed comfortable with herself. ''Worry, if not gone altogether, no longer haunts you in the middle of the night,'' she wrote. ''And you are free -- or freer -- to turn down the things that bore you and spend time on matters and with people you enjoy.''         And she did, till the end. Just two weeks ago she was surrounded by friends at the annual party her daughter gave for her in Southampton, N.Y., and last week was in Idaho for a conference of media executives where she saw more friends and colleagues. She was on her way to a bridge game when she fell.         Katharine Graham's life ended the way she said she wanted it to: ''The only thing I think any of us want,'' she once said, ''is to last as long as we're any good. And then not.''       
         Eudora Welty, whose evocative short stories, notable for their imagery, sharp dialogue and fierce wit, made her a revered figure in contemporary American letters, died yesterday at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 92.         She was plagued by health problems and had been confined for some time to her home, where she had lived since high school and where she wrote most of her stories, novels, essays, memoirs and book reviews.         As a short-story master, Miss Welty is often mentioned by critics in the same breath as Chekhov, but she was  dismissed early in her career as a regionalist and did not earn widespread critical respect until she was no longer young. When recognition came, she accepted it with the ease, modesty and grace that had become her hallmarks.         She was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel ''The Optimist's Daughter.'' She also received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, several O. Henry Awards and the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and received the Medal of Freedom in 1980, presented, she said happily, by ''one of my great Southern heroes, President Jimmy Carter.''         Late in 1998 Miss Welty said she was ''excited and delighted'' to learn that she had become the first living writer to be included in the prestigious Library of America series of collected works by United States literary giants. The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.         For decades she was pigeonholed by critics who placed her with Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers as a writer of the so-called Southern School. Her reputation as a regional and apolitical writer was often cited as a reason for her failure to win a Nobel Prize. But her work, like that of those other Southern writers, transcended region and possessed a universal relevance and appeal.         ''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980. ''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''         A Clan of Readers         Eudora Welty was born on April 13, 1909, in Jackson, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty, an Ohio native, and the former Chestina Andrews, who had been a West Virginia schoolteacher. The Weltys settled in Jackson shortly after their marriage, and Mr. Welty became an executive of the Lamar Life Insurance company. They also had two sons younger than Miss Welty.         The Weltys were devoted to books and learning. In ''One Writer's Beginnings,'' Miss Welty's 1984 memoir based on a series of lectures she gave at Harvard, she recalled the exhilaration she felt when she fell under the spell of books.         ''It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that storybooks had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass,'' she wrote. ''Yet regardless of where they came from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''         Miss Welty was a daily visitor to the local Andrew Carnegie Library, where she was allowed what she later called ''a sweet devouring'' -- a ration of two books a day by the stern-faced librarian. Several decades later, in 1986, the building was replaced; the new one was named the Eudora Welty Library.         Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.         ''It took Latin to thrust me into a bona fide alliance with words in their true meaning,'' she wrote. ''Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence. I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''         'Listening for Stories'         Miss Welty said she discovered stories in daily life. ''Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories,'' she wrote in 1984. ''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''         Miss Welty attended the Mississippi State College for Women, where she helped to start a literary magazine, and then the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1929. After college Miss Welty told her parents that she wanted to be a writer, but she said that her father insisted that she ''learn something to fall back on'' to support herself, so she took advertising courses at the Columbia University School of Business.         Back in Jackson in the early 1930's, Miss Welty wrote for a radio station and contributed society items to The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. During the Depression she got a publicity job at the Works Progress Administration, which enabled her to travel throughout Mississippi. She was troubled and fascinated by the people she saw and took hundreds of snapshots with a cheap camera, developing her prints in her kitchen at night. In 1971 Random House published a collection of these pictures, ''One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression.'' The book's stark, often grim black-and-white photographs revealed that Miss Welty's long-admired sense of observation was not limited to the ear.         ''I learned quickly enough when to click the shutter,'' she said later, ''but what I was becoming aware of more slowly was a story-writer's truth. The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it. In my own case, a fuller awareness of what I needed to find out about people and their lives had to be sought for through another way, through writing stories. I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''         The Depression pictures were exhibited in New York in 1936, the same year that Miss Welty, who had sent dozens of unsolicited stories to magazines, finally made her first sale. A small literary magazine called Manuscript accepted ''Death of a Traveling Salesman,'' the often anthologized recounting of the last day in the life of a lonely, ill and frightened shoe salesman who loses his way in rural Mississippi. Before he dies of a heart attack, he realizes fleetingly how little he has understood about himself and others.         It was the first of several stories published in small magazines. ''None of these publications paid, not really,'' Miss Welty recalled years later. ''Oh, I think The Southern Review was giving $25 a story, but it took two years before an agent could place one of my stories in a national magazine.''         Life at the P.O.         Miss Welty began to attract attention after The Atlantic Monthly published two of her stories destined to become classics: ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' and ''A Worn Path.'' The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office. The second won Miss Welty her first of six O. Henry Awards.         Early admirers of her short stories pressed Miss Welty to try her hand at a novel, but she resisted for several years. Her first hardcover book was a 1941 short-story collection, ''A Curtain of Green,'' with an introduction by Katherine Anne Porter, who had encouraged her early on. ''A Curtain of Green '' sold only 7,000 copies in 30 years, but the 17 stories in the collection became widely known and valued through their inclusion in many anthologies and college textbooks.         The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.' to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''         ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' combined Miss Welty's antic sense of humor with her pleasure in language. As the narrator prepares to leave her family's home, she says: ''So I hope to tell you I marched in and got the radio. And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot . . . The thermometer and the Hawaiian ukulele were certainly mine, and I stood on the stepladder and got all my watermelon-rind preserves and every fruit and vegetable I put up, every jar.''         An Internet Legacy         Many years later Eudora, the widely used e-mail program, was named after Miss Welty because its designer, Steven Dorner, said he had been processing so much e-mail that he felt like the Welty character who lived at the post office.         In 1941 Miss Welty followed ''A Curtain of Green'' with ''The Wide Net and Other Stories,'' and in 1942 she published ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' a novella that later became a successful musical in an adaptation by Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman. Her first full-length novel, ''Delta Wedding,'' appeared in 1946.         Three years later, a group of stories set in Morgana, an imaginary small town on the Mississippi Delta, was published under the title ''The Golden Apples.'' All of Miss Welty's gifts for compression, metaphorical language and poetic structure were on display. So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart. In the story ''The Whole World Knows,'' she charted a doomed meeting between a young couple who were estranged:         ''There in the flower beds walked the same robins. The sprinkler dripped now. Once again we went into the house by the back door. Our hands touched. We had stepped on Tellie's patch of mint. The yellow cat was waiting to go in with us, the door handle was as hot as the hand, and on the step, getting under the feet of two people who went in together, the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water -- ''Watch out for Mama's!'' -- a thousand times we had gone in like that. As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''         During World War II, Miss Welty was briefly on the staff of The New York Times Book Review and sometimes contributed reviews under the pseudonym Michael Ravenna. But she returned to Jackson during the 1950's, when her mother and brothers fell seriously ill. For almost 15 years, from the mid-50's to the late 60's, she published just a few short stories, some book reviews and a children's book, ''The Shoe Bird'' (1964). During this period she cared for her family and worked on two novels. Some writers speculated that she also suffered some spiritual ordeal or artistic crisis. After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''         Miss Welty's stories often reflected the fruits of her wide reading and special interests. ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.         In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.         Fiction of Family Life         That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life. They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.         Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders. Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she  demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager. This novel was adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and became a hit when it opened on Broadway in 1956.         Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place. We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way. We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations. We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''         And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?' ''         ''I didn't need their pointers to know that there was injustice among human beings or that there was trouble,'' she continued. ''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this. I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else. Whatever else makes them up interests me.''         Miss Welty made one notable exception to her rule against direct crusading when Medgar Evers, the black civil rights leader, was shot to death by a sniper in Jackson in 1963.         ''I did write a story the night it happened,'' she said. ''I was so upset about this, and I thought: I live down here where this happened and I believe I must know what a person like that felt like -- the murderer. There had been so many stories about such a character in the stock manner, written by people who didn't know the South, so I wrote about the murderer intimately -- in the first person, which was a very daring thing for me to do.''         In the Mind of an Assassin         The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested. Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath. Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.         Miss Welty never married. (Marriage, she said, ''never came up.'') She leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she was a shy person, she had many friends who were writers, among them Porter, Robert Penn Warren, Elizabeth Bowen, V. S. Pritchett, Cleanth Brooks, Shelby Foote, Walker Percy, Elizabeth Spencer, Ross MacDonald and Reynolds Price. She also had an enduring friendship with Diarmuid Russell, the agent who fiercely and devotedly represented her.         Her friends often spoke of her innate courtesy, which led her to seldom turn down requests for interviews. Those conversations usually took place at her home, and she often offered her interviewer bourbon and a home-cooked meal. She was warm and humorously self-deprecating.         One unlikely caller was Henry Miller. Miss Welty's mother, who had heard that Miller was a writer of obscene books, banned him from  their house. When Miss Welty did see him, she reported that he was ''the dullest man I ever saw in my life.''         ''He wasn't interested in anything outside himself,'' she said, ''that was the truth.''         In 1943, Faulkner wrote an unsolicited letter to Miss Welty after he had by chance read ''The Robber Bridegroom.''         ''You're doing all right,'' he said. That letter was hung near her wooden desk in an upstairs room in the Tudor-style house that her father built on Pinehurst Street in 1925, when she was 16.         ''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said. ''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''         Correction:  July 25, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the author Eudora Welty yesterday misstated the number of O. Henry Awards she received for short stories and misidentified the first of her stories to win one. The total was eight, not six. The first was for ''Petrified Man'' (1939); ''A Worn Path'' won in 1941.       
         Kim Stanley, whose infrequent but luminous stage portraits brought her to the edge of greatness, but who ultimately shrank from the pressures of performance and stardom, died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 76 and lived in Santa Fe.         She died after a prolonged illness, said her daughter Rachel Ryder Zahn.         In plays like William Inge's ''Picnic,'' Horton Foote's ''Traveling Lady'' and, especially, Inge's ''Bus Stop,'' Ms. Stanley captivated Broadway audiences and dazzled the critics in roles that ranged from a gauche young tomboy to a gallant abandoned wife to a well-traveled wisecracking nightclub singer.         She seemed able to take on almost any part and make it come convincingly alive. In the 1955 ''Bus Stop,'' she played Cherie, a worn-at-the-edges nightclub singer -- she calls herself a chanteuse -- who finds herself sitting out a snowstorm in a Kansas diner with her fellow bus passengers, one of whom is a swaggering cowboy. Their sparring not only won laughs, but also touched the heart.         Ms. Stanley, who later admitted to being tone deaf, even managed a deftly comic rendition of ''That Old Black Magic.'' Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, summed up her work as superb and called it a ''glowing performance that is full of amusing detail -- cheap, ignorant, bewildered, but also radiant with personality.''         Ms. Stanley had already won accolades two years earlier as the hoydenish teenager Millie Owens in ''Picnic.'' Then, cast as Georgette Thomas, a young mother whose husband has deserted her in Mr. Foote's 1954 drama ''The Traveling Lady,'' Ms. Stanley so dominated the stage that she was given star billing two days after the play's premiere.         There were more good reviews for her stage work in the years that followed. She appeared in ''A Clearing in the Woods,'' ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Cheri,'' ''A Far Country'' and ''The Three Sisters,'' among other plays, but nothing came close to her success in ''Bus Stop'' except her performance in the 1958 film ''The Goddess,'' one of her rare forays into Hollywood.         In that film Ms. Stanley won praise as a glamorous actress whose life is emotionally barren, managing to project glamour even though she was quick to concede she was no celluloid siren. She soon decided she did not much like acting for the cameras. The fragmented nature of movie making frustrated her. It was, she said, like ''shooting pool in the dark.''         Kim Stanley, whose original name was Patricia Reid, was born on Feb. 11, 1925, in Tularosa, N.M. Her parents were divorced when she was a young girl, and she and her three brothers were raised by her mother, an interior decorator who moved the family from New Mexico to Texas. Often lonely as a child, she wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming an artist or, at the very least, the local May Queen. She acted in school plays, attended the University of New Mexico and eventually graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Texas.         Her acting experiences in school had kindled a spark, she later said, but she was still thinking of pursuing a graduate degree and perhaps a career in medicine. Then she was approached by a director of the Pasadena Playhouse, who by chance had seen her perform in a college production and offered her a scholarship. She stayed at the California theater only a year, but it was enough to change the course of her life. The compass pointed toward Broadway.         After a season of walk-ons with a stock company in Louisville, Ky., where she'd gone at the urging of a friend who was working there, she boarded a Greyhound bus for New York. After a few fruitless months of making the rounds, talking to agents and trying to see producers, she turned to modeling dresses and then worked as a waitress at a hotel. She also went through a brief marriage to another aspiring actor, Bruce Hall.         The Off Broadway theater was in its infancy, but Ms. Stanley (she had taken her maternal grandmother's maiden name some years before) took an unpaid job with a Greenwich Village group called the Interplayers and lived off the money she had earned as a model. She met other promising newcomers, among them Gene Saks, Sidney Lumet and Michael V. Gazzo (later to write ''A Hatful of Rain'') and soon found herself in a new group called Off Broadway Inc.         She joined the Actors Studio, where she met and worked with the Studio's guru, Lee Strasberg, and later described him as the person ''who made it possible for the whole world to open up for me.'' Method acting, she said, was the key to becoming ''as free as possible.''         In 1949 she put her training to work at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, acting opposite Anthony Franciosa in Gertrude Stein's ''Yes Is for a Very Young Man,'' a production that drew good reviews and calls from theatrical agents. More good notices followed her next appearance, as St. Joan at the Equity Library Theater, and when the producer Kermit Bloomgarden called to invite her to replace Julie Harris in Lillian Hellman's ''Montserrat,'' she made the leap to Broadway.         Ms. Stanley married for the second time in 1949, to another actor, Curt Conway, with whom she had a son, Jamison, and a daughter, Lisa, and soon found herself torn between the conflicting demands of family and career. Performance pressures also began to take their toll, and even after her shining success in ''Bus Stop,'' stories began to circulate about her profound malaise each night at curtain time. By 1957 she had been though another divorce and remarriage, this time to the actor and director Alfred Ryder, by whom she had another daughter, Rachel. Her children survive her, along with a brother, Justin, and three grandchildren.         By the end of the 50's there were other signs of trouble. In 1958 she appeared with Helen Hayes and the British actor Eric Portman in ''A Touch of the Poet'' by Eugene O'Neill. Atkinson hailed Ms. Stanley and Ms. Hayes as ''the two finest actresses of their respective generations.'' Nevertheless, after opening night Ms. Stanley missed a number of performances. It was no secret by then that she and Portman were not on speaking terms, and it was no great surprise when Ms. Stanley abruptly left the play, blaming Portman for slapping her in one scene with what she said was excessive enthusiasm. Portman in turn declared, ''I don't go bashing people in the face,'' but Ms. Stanley was gone for good.         Such conflicts aside, she was still working at perfecting her art. ''To keep it fresh, I try to begin all over again in each performance,'' she told an interviewer. In 1959 she played a middle-aged woman in love with a handsome 19-year-old (Horst Buchholz) in ''Cherie,'' adapted by Anita Loos from two novels by Colette and set in France in the years just before and after World War I. Atkinson found her performance ''magnetic and illuminating.'' Two years later, in Henry Denker's semi-documentary 1961 play ''A Far Country,'' directed by her husband, Alfred Ryder, Ms. Stanley won praise as a young woman afflicted by hysterical paralysis who is helped by the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.         In 1964 Ms. Stanley returned to the source of her first inspiration as an actress and appeared as Masha in an  Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' directed by her old mentor, Lee Strasberg, and co-starring Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight. It was to be Ms. Stanley's last appearance on the New York stage.         The same year, in the British film thriller ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' her portrayal of a sinister London medium who, with her compliant husband (Richard Attenborough), schemes to kidnap a child, won her rave reviews and an Oscar nomination as best actress. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther described Ms. Stanley's portrait of the woman as ''a humble, cloying shrew -- an insidiously diabolic creature, and yet a pitiful victim.'' She did not win an Oscar, although the New York Film Critics gave her their best actress award. Moviegoers were not to see her again for 18 years.         In little more than a decade she had established herself as one of Broadway's most brilliant actresses although, oddly, she never won a Tony Award. She had a number of television appearances to her credit, appearing in various dramatic series and winning an Emmy in 1963 for her work in a ''Ben Casey'' episode about mercy killing. But there were only the two Hollywood films, ''The Goddess'' and ''Seance.'' And for a long while that was the sum of her career: brilliant but all too brief. She returned to her native New Mexico, put aside the stresses of performing, did some teaching in Santa Fe and nursed her ambition to have her own ensemble of actors.         By 1979, however, she was back in New York as artistic director of a troupe of actors in a small theater in SoHo. ''I want to be involved with the great plays,'' she told an interviewer, and admitted that she missed acting and intended to act again. For one thing, she said, ''before I get too old, I'd like to do Hedda Gabler,'' and, she added, she wanted to make ''a serious film about Virginia Woolf.''         As it turned out, she did neither, but she did return to films in 1982 in ''Frances,'' in which she played the ambitious, devouring mother of the actress Frances Farmer (Jessica Lange). Her performance brought her a second Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. The next year, she had a small part as a barnstorming pilot in ''The Right Stuff.'' And she returned to television in 1984, winning her second Emmy in the role of Big Mama in a PBS production of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' with Ms. Lange and Tommy Lee Jones.         There the story ended. Ms. Stanley spent her last years quietly, back in New Mexico. ''You can't be good in the theater unless you've immersed yourself in the marvelous detective story of the human spirit,'' she once told an interviewer. ''But it's difficult, terribly difficult.''         In her case the mystery remained unsolved. She had, in effect, achieved her childhood dream of becoming the May Queen, but chose to leave the parade before its end.         Correction:  August 27, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the actress Kim Stanley on Tuesday misstated the surname of her son and misidentified his father. The son changed his name to Jamison Clift from Conway in the 1980's. His father was William Brooks Clift Jr., not Ms. Stanley's second husband, Curt Conway.         The obituary also omitted a film credit for Ms. Stanley. The Actors Studio production of ''The Three Sisters'' in which she played Masha was videotaped in 1965 and transferred to film and released in 1977.       
         Diana Golden Brosnihan, who lost a leg to cancer at 12, won a gold medal in disabled skiing at the 1988 Calgary Olympics and played a key role in public appreciation of disabled athletes, died Saturday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. She was 38.         Her cancer returned in 1992 and again in 1997.         ''I like to live each day like an adventure,'' she once said.         She did that so well that Sports Illustrated once wrote that she was ''most likely to be remembered as the woman who, perhaps more than any other athlete, brought crossover credibility to the disabled sports movement.''         She was inducted into the Women's Sports Foundation International Hall of Fame in 1997. The citation read, ''She persuaded the ski world to treat all athletes the same, regardless of ability or, in her case, disability.'' She was also inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame that year.         Brosnihan, who grew up in Lincoln, Mass., outside Boston, learned to ski at 5. At 12, she developed bone cancer in her right leg, resulting in amputation above the knee. When she awakened after surgery, her first words were, ''Will I still be able to ski?'' Six months later, she was skiing.         As a high school sophomore, she discovered that she could jog on crutches. In her junior year, the high school ski coach asked her to join the team. She did, and a year later she won the downhill in the world handicapped championships.         ''If you had ever told me that I would make being an athlete my profession, I would have laughed at you, and my family would have laughed at you,'' she once said. ''It was not even a dream.'' But it became a reality. It also became an albatross, and from 1982 to 1985, she took two and a half years off from skiing.         ''It gave me time to find my identity apart from my skiing so that when I came back to skiing it was something I wanted to do for me and not because I needed that image from other people,'' she said.         She used one ski and two outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips attached). Later, never using an artificial leg, she abandoned the outriggers in favor of regular ski poles so she could go faster.         She rejoined the national disabled team and persuaded potential corporate sponsors to support the team as they would any other. She persuaded the United States Ski Association to allow disabled skiers to compete in national championships against able-bodied skiers.         That open-competition policy became known as the Golden Rule, and she took advantage of it. She might finish last, 20 seconds behind a renowned skier like Tamara McKinney, but said she would come closer next time. She often did.         Against other disabled skiers, her success was overwhelming. From 1986 to 1990, she won 10 world and 19 United States championships. In the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, when disabled skiing was a demonstration sport, she won the gold medal in the giant slalom. The United States Olympic Committee voted her the female skier of the year, ahead of able-bodied skiers.         In 1991, the Women's Sports Foundation gave her the Flo Hyman award, which had previously gone to Martina Navratilova, Evelyn Ashford, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Chris Evert.         That year, she retired (for the last time) from competition and took up rock climbing and mountaineering. Then the cancer returned, leading to bilateral mastectomies, the loss of her uterus and an attempted suicide. Again, she turned herself around, climbed Mount Rainier and continued as a motivational speaker.         In 1997, the cancer returned again and spread to her spine, pelvis and lungs. She stopped giving motivational speeches, saying she could not be upbeat anymore and could not force a smile.         At Dartmouth, where she received a degree in English literature in 1984, she casually met Steve Brosnihan, who became a freelance cartoonist for New England newspapers. They met again in 1996 and were married in August 1997 between her chemotherapy sessions.         She is survived by her husband, of Bristol, R.I., her mother, a brother and a sister.         To the end, Brosnihan fought for dignified treatment and perceptions of the disabled. ''You think about women,'' she said, ''and people used to pat us on the back and say: 'Isn't that sweet? She's competing.' Now they don't do that anymore. It's the same with the disabled. People treat us with dignity.         ''To me it has to do with the dignity of each person. Each person is worthy of respect, so it's a matter of if I choose to live with that dignity myself.         ''Sometimes, stereotypes make me laugh. Like when people introduce you as courageous. Often, I've heard it on television, 'We're talking with a girl today who had cancer when she was 12, beat the odds and now she skis.' I say: 'Now wait a minute. I don't just ski. I'm the best in the world and I train my heart and soul out for this and I ski 150 days and I work out in the weight room, and to me courageous doesn't imply any of that.'         ''Athletes don't want to be courageous. They want to be good.''         In 1988, she skied on screen for three minutes in a feature-length movie, ''Escape to Ski.'' Warren Miller, who made the film, became an instant fan.         ''After you're with her for a few minutes, you totally forget her handicap,'' he said. ''She has her act together, and it's not an act.''       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Joanne Minnich, whose heart was cut out to remove a cancer and then restored to her body in an extraordinary operation that drew widespread attention last November, died on Thursday at her home in Mahopac, N.Y. She was 58.         The cause was cancer, her husband, William, said.         Mrs. Minnich learned in April 2000 that she had a rare type of cancer called fibrous histiocytoma sarcoma, and she underwent open-heart surgery to remove it. But the cancer recurred in September.         She then went to Houston, where surgeons had reported success in rarely performed surgery for cancerous heart tumors.         Mrs. Minnich said that she underwent the risky surgery in hopes that her experience would help others if not herself.         On Nov. 14 in Houston, Dr. Michael J. Reardon removed Mrs. Minnich's heart from her chest, put it in ice in a metal bowl, and cut out three large cancerous tumors and one small one. With the heart still in the bowl, Dr. Reardon rebuilt it using parts of a cow's heart.         Mrs. Minnich did well until March, when the cancer recurred in her abdomen and chemotherapy failed.         Dr. Reardon said he had performed two similar heart operations on patients who learned about the procedure from Mrs. Minnich's experience. Her case led a surgical colleague to perform a third operation in Guatemala. All three patients are alive, Dr. Reardon said.         Mr. Minnich said, ''Joanne did what she wanted to do, and that was trying to help others.''         Mrs. Minnich was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and worked in her family's woodworking business.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Virginia, of Chicago, and Kimberly, of Yonkers; a son, William, of Mahopac; and her mother, Elizabeth Roos of Yonkers.       
         Pauline Kael, who expressed her passion for movies in jaunty, jazzy prose as the longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died yesterday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 82.         Ms. Kael was probably the most influential film critic of her time. She reviewed movies for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1979, and again, after working briefly in the film industry, from 1980 until 1991. Earlier, she was a film critic for Life magazine in 1965, for McCall's in 1965 and 1966 and for The New Republic in 1966 and 1967.         Enchanting her fans and infuriating her foes, rarely dull and often sharp and funny, with an intellectualism that reflected her background as a student of philosophy, Ms. Kael was never anything but outspoken.         Whether dismissing auteur theory, reviewing Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' (1975) before it was finished, questioning the extent of Orson Welles's contribution to ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) or proclaiming Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' (1973) as a cultural event comparable to the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Ms. Kael was always provocative. Her seductive writing style bred a legion of acolytes, known as Paulettes.         The critic Louis Menand wrote in The New York Review of Books in March 1995: ''Kael was the most brilliantly ad hoc critic of her time, and she made it possible to care about movies without feeling pompous or giddy by showing that what comes first in everyone's experience of a movie isn't the form or the idea but the sensation, and that this is just as true for moviegoers who have been taught to intellectualize their responses to art as it is for everyone else.''         By the time she retired, Mr. Menand observed, she had produced a generation of inferior imitators. ''The manner of appreciation she invented has become the standard manner of popular culture criticism in America,'' he wrote.         Assessing her impact in a 1998 interview, Ms. Kael said: ''I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They've rarely agreed with me about movies.''         At the same time, she deflected the question of whether her criticism had had any effect on films and filmmakers. ''I'd rather not say,'' she answered. ''If I say yes, I'm an egotist, and if I say no, I've wasted my life. Although I've been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy.''         Overpraising or overdamning was Ms. Kael's way, and she left no doubt about her favorites: actors like Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, John Travolta, Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, and actresses like Joan Cusack, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver and Debra Winger.         She championed films of the 1970's, like Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' (1972) and ''Godfather, Part II'' (1974); Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' (1973) and ''Taxi Driver'' (1976); Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo'' (1975); and Mr. Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971) and ''M*A*S*H'' (1970). She also liked the sensual violence of directors like Sam Peckinpah, whose films included ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and ''Straw Dogs'' (1971), and Brian De Palma, whose works include ''Carrie'' (1976) and ''Casualties of War'' (1989).         ''You know, they talk about the golden age of the cinema as if it took place in the late 30's or in the 40's,'' she said in 1989. ''There was nothing personal and exciting in most of those movies. They were machine tooled. They were a lot of fun. But except for Preston Sturges and a few flukey individualists, they just didn't have the personal voice of the movies of the 70's.''         As a writer whose heyday spanned the years from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) to ''Awakenings'' (1990), ''Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ''L.A. Story'' (1991), Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.         In a 1968 review in The New York Times of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,'' a collection of Ms. Kael's reviews and articles, Eliot Fremont-Smith called her ''the most quotable critic writing; but what is important and bracing is that she relates movies to other experiences, to ideas and attitudes, to ambition, books, money, other movies, to politics and the evolving culture, to moods of the audience, to our sense of ourselves -- to what movies do to us, the acute and self-scrutinizing awareness of which is always at the core of her judgment.''         Reviewing ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) in treacle-curdling prose that reportedly prompted McCall's to dismiss her, Ms. Kael asked, ''Wasn't there perhaps one little Von Trapp who didn't want to sing his head off or who screamed that he wouldn't act out little glockenspiel routines for Papa's party guests, or who got nervous and threw up if he had to get out on a stage?''         Writing about Kevin Costner in ''Dances With Wolves'' (1990), she said he had ''feathers in his hair and feathers in his head.'' Writing about Robert De Niro in ''Awakenings,'' she said, ''It's in the quiet moments that he's particularly bad.'' She also said that that film contained ''another of Robin Williams's benevolent-eunuch roles.''         At her peak, she lauded popular movies like Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' (1975) and Philip Kaufman's ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978) and became more of a supporter of the auteur theory. But in time, Ms. Kael, who attracted notice early in her career by attacking critics like Bosley Crowther of The Times and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, came under fire for predictability and dogmatism.         It was inevitable that she should be the object of criticism herself. George Lucas named the villainous General Kael in ''Willow'' (1988) for her, and in a celebrated onslaught in The New York Review of Books in 1980, the writer Renata Adler declared Ms. Kael's work ''piece by piece, line by line, without interruption, worthless.''         Ms. Adler, a former film critic for The Times, wrote that Ms. Kael's recent work ''falls somewhere between huckster copy and ideological pamphleteering,'' and that ''mistaking lack of civility for vitality, she substitutes for argument a protracted, obsessional invective.''         Assessing her own work, Ms. Kael said: ''I try not to be rough on small films. Generally, when I'm really rough, it's on something that I know is going to be a big hit, and that everybody is going to go for it, and I think it's an atrocity -- that's fair game. I'm interested in discovering talent, and in trying to explain why I think someone is talented. I'm more interested in that than I am in panning.''         Over the years, Ms. Kael's reviews and essays were assembled in a series of books whose double-entendre titles suggested the intimacy of her love affair with movies (she preferred the word ''movies'' to ''film'' or ''cinema''). Among them were ''I Lost It at the Movies'' (1965); ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (1968); ''Going Steady'' (1970); ''Deeper Into Movies'' (1973), a 1974 National Book Award winner; ''Reeling'' (1976); ''When the Lights Go Down'' (1980); ''Hooked'' (1989); ''Movie Love'' (1991); and ''For Keeps'' (1994).         When the last was published, she said in the introduction: ''I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have.''         Central to her approach to criticism was her belief that the popular appeal of movies was rooted in trash. In her essay ''Trash, Art and the Movies,'' reprinted in ''Going Steady,'' Ms. Kael wrote: ''Movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip -- from what was coarse and common.''         She went on to say: ''If we've grown up at the movies, we know that good work is not continuous with the academic, respectable tradition but with glimpses of something good in trash, but we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain of discovery. Trash has given us an appetite for art.''         Ms. Kael's appetite for the movies began in childhood. The fifth child and third daughter of immigrants from Poland, Isaac Paul Kael and the former Judith Friedman, she was born in Petaluma, Calif., on June 19, 1919. She described her father as a gentleman farmer and a moviegoer, and her own trips to see films began early.         Among the favorites she recalled were comedies in the late 1920's that starred Bebe Daniels as a wisecracking flapper; ''Million Dollar Legs'' (1932), with W. C. Fields; and the Marx Brothers's ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933).         For a time the Kaels lived on their Sonoma County farm, which they lost in the Depression. Ms. Kael was 8 when her family moved to San Francisco.         ''A bookish girl from a bookish family'' is the way she once described herself. Blue-eyed, brown-haired, five feet tall and weighing a bit more than 100 pounds, she said: ''I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at 'Kentucky Moonshine,' a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to a movie again.''         In 1936 she enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in philosophy. Despite expectations that she would proceed to law school or teaching, she went to New York with a friend, the poet Robert Horan, for about three years.         When she returned to the Bay Area, she led a bohemian life, tried her hand at writing plays and helped make experimental films. Married and divorced three times, she supported herself and her daughter, Gina James, by writing advertising copy, clerking in a bookstore and working as a cook, a seamstress and a textbook writer.         Ms. Kael never wrote movie criticism until she was 35 and, she said, ''I never made a living at this until I was in my 40's.'' Her career at The New Yorker did not begin until she was nearly 50.         The turning point in her life came, as in a Hollywood script, when she was discovered in a coffee shop in the Bay Area in 1953. She was arguing about a movie with a friend when the editor of City Lights magazine asked them each to review Chaplin's ''Limelight.'' The friend turned in nothing. Ms. Kael's review called the film ''slimelight,'' and a career was born.         Soon Ms. Kael was being published in magazines like Sight and Sound and Partisan Review, and her provocative criticism was being broadcast weekly on KPFA, Berkeley's listener-supported radio station. The radio criticism led to an offer to manage an art theater, which she turned into a two-screen house, the Berkeley Cinema Guild Theaters.         ''I made the displays, wrote the program and cleaned the chewing gum off the seats,'' she said. She revived W. C. Fields, Mae West and Busby Berkeley films and Welles's ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) and showed Ingmar Bergman films before they became staples of art houses elsewhere. ''It was exciting turning up things and drawing an audience to see them,'' she said.         The feisty, funny reviews that she wrote for the programs enhanced her reputation, and she began lecturing on film at universities in San Francisco and Los Angeles.         She was 46 when her essays in Partisan Review led to an offer to publish her first book, ''I Lost It at the Movies,'' a collection of her articles and broadcasts, which became a best seller. In it she praised movies like Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (1937), Vittorio de Sica's ''Shoeshine'' (1946) and Martin Ritt's ''Hud'' (1963). She attacked other critics, poked fun at materialistic movie magnates and derided the pretensions of Alain Resnais's ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), calling it ''the snow job in the ice palace.''         Assignments from magazines began to flow in, and in 1965, Ms. Kael, her daughter and Ms. Kael's two basenjis (dogs that, interestingly, cannot bark) moved to New York.         In 1968, in response to an offer from  William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, who was willing to let her write whatever she wanted and at length, Ms. Kael began to review movies for the magazine. Until 1979, she reviewed weekly from September through March, and Penelope Gilliatt reviewed for the other half of the year.         Ms. Kael's first review for The New Yorker was virtually the only rave that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' received in New York, but it compelled other critics to reconsider their assessments.         At 59, Ms. Kael left The New Yorker for Hollywood. She briefly worked as a production executive for Warren Beatty. After that job ended over what were described as ''artistic differences,'' Paramount Pictures put her under contract as a consultant and scout for several months before she returned to The New Yorker in 1980.         Ms. Gilliatt had departed, and Ms. Kael began writing every two weeks, commuting to New York from a Victorian home on four and a half acres in Massachusetts that she bought for $37,000 in 1970. In New York, she stayed in a hotel for four days and saw two movies nightly. Back home at night, she wrote. Her daughter, an artist, lived nearby with her family.         She is survived by her daughter, Ms. James, of Great Barrington, and a grandson, William Friedman, also of Great Barrington, and two sisters, Anne Wallach and Rose Makower, both of Berkeley.         Ms. Kael was reputed never to see a film more than once, yet she seemed to remember everything, from lighting and costumes to writing, sound, direction and performances.         In 1991, at 71, after 22 years at The New Yorker, Ms. Kael retired from regular reviewing.         Looking back on her impassioned love affair with movies, she once said, ''I was a film critic the way somebody might write poetry, for fun or love.''       
         Barbara K. Olson, who was killed on Tuesday on the commercial jetliner that was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon, was well known to television viewers across the nation as a combative and confident political commentator representing the conservative Republican point of view.         Mrs. Olson, 45, was also half of a highly influential couple on Washington's social-political scene; her husband, Theodore B. Olson, an appellate lawyer, successfully argued the Florida election case for George W. Bush before the Supreme Court. President Bush named Mr. Olson the nation's solicitor general, the official who formulates the administration's strategy before the nation's courts.         Mr. Olson was in his Justice Department office on Tuesday morning when he received two calls from Mrs. Olson, who was using her cell phone aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to tell him the plane had been hijacked. Her description of what was occurring in her last moments provided what officials said was valuable information about the incident. She reported that the flight crew had been herded to the back of the plane with the passengers, and she asked her husband what she should tell the pilot who was apparently beside her while the hijackers were in control of the cockpit.         Mrs. Olson's friends and her husband said her efforts to ''do something'' on the doomed plane were exquisitely in character. ''She never sat back,'' her husband said in an interview.         The Olsons, who were married four years ago, complemented each other in style. Mrs. Olson was the more outspoken of the two in her televised commentaries, while Mr. Olson presented a more deliberative face in his role as the reigning constitutional litigator for the Republican establishment.         Although Mrs. Olson was generally a take-no-prisoners advocate, Mr. Olson recalled on Tuesday that she recently told him she had come to believe that the national political debate had become too acrimonious. He recalled that she said that during one television appearance, she believed those who called in comments to her and her liberal counterpart, Bill Press, were far too harsh.         Barbara Kay Bracher Olson was born on Dec. 27, 1955, in Houston, and trained to be a teacher at the University of St. Thomas in her hometown. But, she had told friends, she wanted to save enough money to go to law school and decided a quicker way to do so than teaching was to become a part of the film industry.         With no experience in the field but  an abundance of self-confidence, she moved to Hollywood and began telephoning production companies connected to well-known actors, offering herself as an all-around helper. Stacy Keach finally offered her a job, Mr. Olson recalled this week, and when she saved enough money to go to law school, she moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Olson turned down jobs in New York after law school because she yearned to live in Washington. As chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Republican majority from  1995 to 1996, Mrs. Olson led the investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in firing longtime employees of the White House travel office. She became a caustic and relentless critic of the Clintons.         Mrs. Olson wrote ''Hell to Pay'' (Regnery, 1999), a highly critical book about Mrs. Clinton, and recently finished a sequel, ''Final Days,'' about the Clintons' last weeks in the White House. Mr. Olson said it would be published by Regnery.         Mrs. Olson is survived by her brother, David Bracher, and her sister, Antoinette Lawrence, both of Houston, as well as her husband.       
         Berry Berenson Perkins, a photographer and eclectic fashion plate of the 1970's before she settled into marriage with the actor Anthony Perkins, was killed on Tuesday, a passenger on American Airlines Flight 11, which was the first jetliner to strike the World Trade Center, a spokeswoman for the family said. She was 53.         She had been returning to her house in the Hollywood Hills from a family summer home on Cape Cod.         With her sister, Marisa, a widely known model of that era who became an actress, Ms. Perkins captured the attention of fashion editors and society columnists. Her photographs appeared in many magazines, including Glamour and Vogue, whose editor, Diana Vreeland, had known the sisters as girls and nicknamed them Mauretania and Berengaria, after the Cunard ocean liners.         Berinthia Berenson was born in New York, part of a seemingly charmed European family. The daughter of the late Robert L. Berenson, a United States Foreign Service officer, and Gogo Schiaparelli Berenson, Ms. Perkins was a granddaughter of the French couturier Elsa Schiaparelli. On her father's side, she was distantly related to Bernard Berenson, the art critic and collector. Ms. Perkins was educated in Switzerland, France and Italy, traveled widely and was introduced to the famous people in her mother's and grandmother's social world.         She met Mr. Perkins in the early 1970's in New York while he was filming ''Play It As It Lays.'' By happenstance, her apartment was used for a scene in the movie, but she later said she had been in love with the actor since age 12. They were married in 1973, in Wellfleet, Mass., in a ceremony characterized by the informality (the barefoot bride wore a granny dress and carried wildflowers) that seemed to characterize much of their marriage.         In a 1977 interview in The New York Times, conducted while she and Mr. Perkins romped with their young sons, Osgood and Elvis, in their Manhattan home, Ms. Perkins said: ''I'm so delighted with my life. I have this fabulous husband, the man I always wanted to marry. I have two fabulous children, which I always wanted, and we're all so happy.''         Mr. Perkins died in 1992. Ms. Perkins spent the last two years of his life nursing him through AIDS-related illness, which he kept secret because of public paranoia about the disease.         In addition to her sister, of New York, Ms. Perkins is survived by her sons, both of Los Angeles, and her mother, the Marchesa Cacciapuoti di Giugliano, of Paris.         In an interview published in the most recent Fashions of the Times, she characterized herself as something of a peacemaker in a family of strong-willed women.         In recent years, Ms. Perkins spent time in Jamaica, where she ran a beachfront bar with her boyfriend. She also followed the careers of her sons. Osgood is an actor and Elvis an artist. While visiting New York in early July, she told friends she planned to see her sister and mother in Europe and then return to her Cape Cod cottage.       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963, and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died yesterday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks, from 40 to 60, she needs personality, and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot high ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to the old and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from the Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink top-of-the line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account. Her second husband planned to go into the business with her but died of a heart attack a month before the start of the business. She decided to carry on with her plans, despite the advice of her lawyer and her accountant. The business opened with nine saleswomen and her 20-year-old son, Richard Rogers, a sales representative for Prudential Life Insurance, as financial administrator.         The skin-care products that formed the basis of the company were developed by J. W. Heath, an Arkansas tanner who noticed that his hands looked younger than his face and began experimenting with the solution he used in his work. The formulas were passed on to his daughter, Ova Heath Spoonemore, who, sometime later, acted as the hostess at a Stanley Home Products party where Mrs. Ash was conducting the demonstration. When that part of the get-together was over, Mrs. Spoonemore handed out jars with penciled labels to her guests, all of whom had beautiful skin. She explained to Mrs. Ash that the women were her guinea pigs. Mrs. Ash, who also received some samples, became a fan and in 1963 bought the formulas from the Heath heirs for $500.         The philosophy of the fledgling company was based on three principles enunciated by Mrs. Ash -- treating others as they themselves would like to be treated, putting God first, family second and career third, and the belief that with praise and encouragement, everyone could succeed.         Although the product line was added to over the years -- there are now more than 200 items for women and men in skin, hair, nail and body care and sun protection -- the Mary Kay formula for success changed little. Consultants remained independent, buying products at wholesale and selling at retail, and from the beginning there were no accounts receivable or personal checks accepted. Orders are paid for with cashier's checks, money orders or credit cards, and consultants are encouraged to conduct their own business in the same way.         In addition to her financial policy, Mrs. Ash also decided that there would be no fixed territories. Consultants who line up recruits in other cities and states still receive commissions on the recruits' purchases although the newcomers are trained and guided by the directors in their home territories. The unusual system worked because, as Mrs. Ash put it, ''each sales director thinks 'I'm helping her but someone else is helping my recruits in other cities.' ''         Shares of Mary Kay were listed in 1968, first in the over-the-counter market and eight years later on the New York Stock Exchange. In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas, 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963 and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died Thursday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks; from 40 to 60, she needs personality; and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better-known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to her old  and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day, multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink, top-of-the-line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force.

         Pauline Campanelli, a painter whose super-realist still lifes were so popular that their sales were rivaled only by those of Andrew Wyeth among living artists, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Pohatcong Township, N.J., a few miles south of Phillipsburg. She was 58.         Her husband, Dan, also a painter, said she died of complications from childhood polio. She had been seriously ill for nearly three years.         Her work was seldom reviewed; and when it was, the reviews generally ran in obscure publications. It was absent from prestigious art museums and expensive galleries. But in the nation's kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms, her precise, loving depictions of household objects were commonplace.         Her work recalled the Shakers in its simplicity and spirituality. Her later paintings were characterized by stark white backgrounds.         Hundreds of thousands of her prints were sold through mail-order catalogs, furniture stores and galleries specializing in prints and posters. Sales of her most popular picture, ''Wild Rose Berries,'' have exceeded 600,000.         ''She outsells Picasso,'' said Julie Fleischmann, president of Shorewood Fine Art, a unit of the New York Graphic Society, which licenses art and sells prints by both the Campanellis and Picasso.         Mrs. Campanelli described herself ''not as an artist who paints but as a person who lives.'' Her paintings, she said, were not creations ''but communications of the essence of that experience.''         She lived with her husband in a stone farmhouse they restored; it is included in the National Register of Historic Places. And despite needing a wheelchair to get around, she pursued dozens of homespun crafts.         Each year she canned 400 jars of fruit from the 39 trees the couple had planted. A talented quilter, cross-stitcher and yarn spinner, she used antique spinning wheels to turn fleece from her four Dorset sheep into yarn that she colored with dyes made from her homegrown herbs. The primitive American antiques she collected were frequent subjects for her paintings.         ''These are not the nostalgic relics of a long forgotten past, but objects that Dan and I live with every day,'' she said.         Her sensibility was decidedly not that of a folk artist. ''Whether it's a swan decoy or a quilt or a chair, I'm just looking at abstract shapes: rectangles, triangles, S-shapes, tall things, round things,'' she said in an interview in the journal U.S. Art in 1989. ''I am very much influenced by Mondrian's compositions.''         Another influence on her art was her belief in paganism. She wrote books, some with her husband, about witchcraft and pagan rituals and tried to bring her appreciation of ancient, pre-Christian ways to her rustic life as well as to her art.         Her book ''Ancient Ways: Reclaiming Pagan Traditions'' (Llewellyn, 1991) told how pagan cultures celebrated holidays, and it sold more than 40,000 copies. The Halloween section not only gave advice on charms and spells, crystal balls and using a tambourine to contact spirits but also gave a recipe for pumpkin bread. The May Day section said washing one's face with morning dew on that holiday would preserve a youthful complexion.         Pauline Eblé was born in the Bronx on Jan. 25, 1943. She was stricken with polio at 3 and was in an iron lung for a year and in the hospital for another year and a half. She was tutored at home and at 13 was studying college textbooks.         She was fascinated with the way her father, Joseph, a professional photographer, could condense three-dimensional reality into two-dimensional images, but she was not initially interested in art. She wanted to be a naturalist and illustrate the species she hoped to discover.         After finishing high school in Ridgewood, N.J., she attended the Ridgewood School of Art. She began selling still lifes while in school.         In 1969 she married Mr. Campanelli. According to a biography posted on the Llewellyn Web site, they were already practicing witchcraft. They lived in a $60-a-month furnished room painted bubble-gum pink and made a bare living, $2,000 the first year, from teaching and sidewalk art shows. Through competitions, bigger art shows and interest from galleries in the area, they gradually got their heads above water.         She earned a reputation for oil paintings of homey objects, and he drew attention for his watercolors of old mills and other historic scenes. In 1976 they bought a stone house built in 1835, naming it and the three surrounding acres Flying Witch Farm. Because they could not get a mortgage and had no savings, they had to restore the sagging, abandoned structure themselves.         He used antique tools because the house had no electricity to plug in power tools. She climbed down from her wheelchair and refinished the floors on her hands and knees.         They filled their new home with antiques like Cromwell chairs from the 1660's and a William and Mary side table from around 1690. Mrs. Campanelli copied a needlepoint design for the Cromwell chairs from museum slides.         Mr. Campanelli built a garage for the three Model A's he restored and a building to house his wife's ''natural history museum,'' which included at least 10,000 seashells. They pressed grapes in an 1860 fruit press and made 100 gallons of wine a year. They occasionally held what they called Colonial days for their friends, entertaining with a quilting bee, a black-powder shoot, a tomahawk throw and Colonial food.         Mrs. Campanelli, who is survived by her husband and father, painted standing on crutches in an 8-by-10-foot studio that used to be a bedroom. The light streamed through a rippled north window, the sort of light she thought Rembrandt liked.         She worked very slowly, averaging about six paintings a year. She meticulously showed each thread in a ball of yarn. She painted any flowers last, in order not to be hurried.         The Campanellis had long thought that a ghost inhabited Flying Witch Farm: that of Mary Insley Hunt, a member of the family that long owned the place.         ''I think Pauline's going to be the next one,'' her husband suggested. ''She wanted to be.''
