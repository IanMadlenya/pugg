         Marion Margery Scranton Isaacs, who was long active in Pennsylvania civic affairs and Republican politics, died on Thursday at the Scranton family home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Dalton, Pa.         Her family said she had a stroke on Dec. 25 and never recovered.         Mrs. Isaacs, a member of the family that gave the city of Scranton its name, supported community improvement projects through the Scranton Area Foundation. Formerly a family charity, it became a public community foundation in 1989, and Mrs. Isaacs served as its chairman from 1954 until her death.         She was the sister of former Gov. William W. Scranton and took part in his Congressional, gubernatorial and Presidential campaigns. She was also a former member of the Pennsylvania Republican State Committee.         She graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1930, was a supporter of the school for the rest of her life and received its Medal for Distinguished Alumnae. She also attended Oxford University and was a trustee emeritus of Marywood College in Scranton.         She devoted herself to the affairs of the Community Medical Center in Scranton, Worthington Scranton Campus of Pennsylvania State University, United Way, Community Services of Pennsylvania, Lackawanna County Welfare Council and Pennsylvania Citizens Association, among others.         Her first husband, Edward B. Mayer, died in 1932. Besides her brother, the former Congressman and Governor, she is survived by her second husband, Albert G. Isaacs Jr.; a son, Edward E. Mayer of Esher, Surrey, England; a stepdaughter, Betsy Cooper of Waverly, Pa.; two sisters, Katherine Rozendaal of Schenectady, N.Y., and Sara Scranton Linen of Greenwich, Conn.; three stepgrandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Dame Judith Anderson, who electrified Broadway audiences in 1947 with her savage performance of the title role in "Medea" and was a memorably sinister housekeeper in the 1940 film "Rebecca," died yesterday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Dame Judith, who was born in Australia, was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960 for "distinguished contributions to the stage." For years she was one of the first ladies of the American theater, repeatedly portraying women gripped by powerful emotions.         After the Broadway premiere of the 1947 "Medea" -- a new adaptation of Euripides's drama, written for Dame Judith by the poet Robinson Jeffers -- Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that she had "set a landmark in the theater" with her "inspired performance of rage and revenge."         Her fiery portrait of a barbarian woman who takes revenge on Jason, the unfaithful father of her two sons, by murdering them won the actress an honored niche in theater history. Many Notable Roles         Among the actress's other notable stage roles were Lavinia Mannon in Eugene O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra" (1932), Delia in Zoe Atkins's "Old Maid" (1935) and Gertrude in "Hamlet" (1936).         She was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her portrayal of the malevolent housekeeper Mrs. Danvers in "Rebecca," a Gothic romance directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier.         She displayed her versatility in a wide range of movie roles, among them the biblical Queen Herodias in "Salome" (1953) and an Indian woman named Buffalo Cow Head in "A Man Called Horse" (1970).         Dame Judith's television successes included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth in 1960 in an NBC-TV "Hallmark Hall of Fame" production. Born to Be Evil         Early in her career, in a 1924 issue of Theater Magazine, Dame Judith wrote, "I like emotional roles because they permit unleashing of one's feelings."         She gave full rein to those feelings in "Medea," a role she seemed to have been born to play. The Broadway production ran for 214 performances and went on an eight-month tour coast to coast. In 1949, she played the part again in New York City in the Jeffers adaptation, this time at City Center, in a production presented and staged by Guthrie McClintic. She performed in the play again in later years, venturing as far as Paris, Berlin and Canberra, Australia.         As time passed, she came to take a broad view of the actor's craft. "We live, we breathe, we experience, we die, we love, we hate, we experience beauty and tragedy, and we find it in the parts we play," she said in a 1984 interview, adding, "Whatever I do, I'm passionate about."         Dame Judith first appeared onstage in 1915 in Sydney, Australia. She made her New York stage debut in 1918 and went on to spend much of her life in the United States.         When she appeared in a 1936 production of "Hamlet" at the Empire Theater, Brooks Atkinson wrote that in her performance as Hamlet's mother, the queen, she had "abandoned the matronly stuffiness that usually plagues that part and given us a woman of strong and bewildered feeling." She went on to play Lady Macbeth in London in 1937.         In 1971 she realized a long-held dream by playing Hamlet in a production staged at Carnegie Hall, but her performance was not well received. Resonance of Tradition         Reviewing the 1982 revival of "Medea," in which she played the nurse who tries in vain to thwart Medea's murderous intentions, Frank Rich wrote in The Times that Dame Judith's presence "gives this 'Medea' the valuable resonance of theatrical tradition" and praised her acting as harrowing. The production was broadcast on public television the next year.         She went on to play a grand dame on an NBC-TV daytime drama, "Santa Barbara," which made its debut in 1984. Her first line, spoken to her chauffeur, was "Ambrose, why have we stopped?" Then she tapped him with a riding crop. A Namesake Off Broadway         The woman who chose to be known professionally as Judith Anderson was named Frances Margaret when she was born on Feb. 10, 1899, to James Anderson-Anderson and the former Jessie Saltmarsh. After attending Australian schools, she made her 1915 stage debut in "A Royal Divorce" at the Theater Royal in Sydney.         Seven decades later in New York City, the former Lion Theater on West 42d Street was renamed the Judith Anderson Theater in her honor. Speaking at a ceremony there, she looked back on what she called "my failures and my successes, my tears and my laughter, my joys and my sorrows, my heartbreaks and my loves, and my pride and my gratitude for the wonderful audiences that have played their music for me to listen to."         Dame Judith's 1937 marriage to Benjamin Harrison Lehman, a professor of English at the University of California at Berkeley, ended in divorce in 1939. Her 1946 marriage to Luther Greene, a theatrical producer, ended in divorce in 1950.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dr. Gloria Friedman Franklin, a psychoanalyst and faculty member of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. Girard Franklin, also a psychoanalyst.         Dr. Friedman, as she was known professionally, felt it important not to hide her illness because of the effect on therapy, her husband said. When she assumed the presidency of the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society in May 1990, she gave an address titled, "Impact of a Therapist's Life -- Threatening Illness on the Therapeutic Situation." The address was published last year by the magazine Contemporary Psychoanalysis.         At the time of her death, Dr. Friedman was a training and supervising analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan besides being a member of the faculty. She was to start teaching a course on women's issues in psychoanalysis next week.         She was also a training and supervising analyst at the Institute for Psychotherapy, an attending psychologist at Roosevelt Hospital and a lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University.         She was particularly known for her work on mother-daughter relationships. In a study on raising children in The New York Times Magazine in March 1985, Dr. Friedman was quoted as saying: "The cultural expectations will always be more powerful than any biological differences. From day one, a mother treats a boy baby differently from a girl baby. Cultural imprinting is so subtle that we can't help ourselves. But it's not a bad thing. We're raising them for the culture they have to live in."         Born and raised a New Yorker, Dr. Friedman graduated from New York University, from which she also received a Ph.D. She earned a master's degree in psychology from City College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Gary, of San Francisco, and two daughters, Lisa, of Philadelphia, and Eve Lynes, of San Mateo, Calif.       
         Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn, a leading fashion model in the 1940's and 50's, died Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Huntington L.I.         She died of pneumonia, a family representative said.         An elegant blonde, the Swedish-born model posed for some of the most famous photographers of the age, including Horst P. Horst, George Hoyningen Huene and Irving Penn, whom she married in 1950. In the late 1940's, when most models were paid $10 to $25 an hour, she was earning $40 an hour. When most models's careers ended before their 30th birthdays, hers flourished until she was past 40.         She was a frequent subject of Penn's photographs for Vogue magazine, particularly his studies of French haute couture. Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of Conde Nast Publications, which publishes Vogue, said the Penns represented "an extraordinary relationship between a photographer and a model."         "She was the inspiration and subject of some of Penn's greatest photographs," Mr. Liberman said yesterday. "She epitomized a very noble period of fashion and couture. She gave a classical dignity to anything she wore." 'A Good Clothes Hanger'         Lisa Fonssagrives had a more down-to-earth attitude to her contributions as a model. She was quoted in a 1949 article in Time magazine as saying: "It is always the dress, it is never, never the girl. I'm just a good clothes hanger."         In addition to modeling, she also pursued careers as a ballet dancer, a photographer, a fashion designer and a sculptor.         She was born in Uddevalla, Sweden. Her father, a dentist who also painted, changed the family name from Anderson, which he considered too commonplace, to Bernstone. Her mother made clothes and encouraged Lisa to study art and ballet.         Lisa Bernstone went to Paris to pursue a dancing career. She met and married Fernand Fonssagrives, a dancer, there in 1935. Photographs Led to Modeling         A year later, Horst took some photographs of her that led to a modeling career. Pictures of her appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1939, she worked both as a model and as a photographer.         She continued both careers after her divorce and subsequent marriage to Penn. After she stopped modeling in the mid-50's, she designed clothes for about six years, at one point doing a collection of leisure wear for Lord & Taylor.         In the 1960's, she devoted her time to sculpturing, working in marble, bronze and fiberglass. She was represented by the Marlborough Gallery.         A book on her work as a model is scheduled for publication later this year in Germany.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer, and a son, Tom Penn, a metal designer, both of New York City; by two sisters, Lilian Bernstone and Kajsa Lundquist, both of Sweden, and by two grandchildren.       
         Sandy Dennis, who as a young actress in the 1960's entranced Broadway and Hollywood with performances that won her two Tony awards and an Academy Award, died on Monday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 54 years old         Although the exact cause of her death was not known, Ms. Dennis had been fighting a long battle with cancer, said Doris Elliott, a longtime friend. Ms. Dennis's death was confirmed by a spokesman for the Lewis Funeral Home in Westport.         Ms. Dennis, born and raised in Nebraska and blessed with an aura of appealing fragility, came to New York at age 18 and within a decade had fashioned a string of outstanding performances, and had earned the awards to prove it. 'Engagingly Natural'         After making her movie debut in 1961 in a supporting role in "Splendor in the Grass," she won a Tony award in 1963 for her performance, as a social worker, opposite Jason Robards in "A Thousand Clowns," and a year later, she won another Tony as the slightly off-beat mistress of a tycoon, played by Gene Hackman, in "Any Wednesday."         Then, in 1966, she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Honey, the mousy, scared-of-her-own-shadow half of a young faculty couple alternately seduced and brow-beaten by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Edward Albee's scalding "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."         She also drew critical praise for her 1967 role as the idealistic schoolteacher in the film "Up the Down Staircase."         Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film in The New York Times, praised her protrayal as "engagingly natural, sensitive, literate and thoroughly moving." He said that Ms. Dennis gave "a vivid performance of emotional range and depth (that) sincerely acquaints us with a genuine loving person we can believe wants to find her pupils' wounds and, what's more, try to heal them -- which she can't."         Her performance won the New York Film Critics' award and the Moscow Film Festival prize for best actress. Fewer Roles         Ms. Dennis's success was extraordinary for any actor or actress, but even then, she seemed to recognize that such oversized fame might be ephemeral. In one interview she remarked that acting "isn't like painting a picture or writing a book. When you finish an acting stint, there's nothing except money. You have to keep going, giving the best you've got to get something intangible."         In her later roles, Ms. Dennis was never able to match the dazzling successes of her earlier years in terms of either public acclaim or favorable reviews from critics. Where once critics had been charmed by her freshness and girl-next-door innocence, many later seemed to detect a mannered nervous quality that drove them to distraction.         This affected even Walter Kerr, the longtime Broadway critic, who had once praised Ms. Dennis's performance in "Any Wednesday" with the line, "Let me tell you about Sandy Dennis. There should be one in every home." Praise From Richard Burton         But in 1967, Mr. Kerr wrote tolerantly but pointedly of Ms. Dennis's "habit" of speaking on stage as though sentences "were poor crippled things that couldn't cross a street without making three false starts from the curb." Still, she continued to work steadily in films and plays and in summer stock.         The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael once complained that Dennis "has made an acting style of postnasal drip," an assessment Ms. Dennis herself said was correct and had worked to change.         Mr. Burton once described her as "one of the most genuine eccentrics I know of."         Ms. Dennis was born Sandra Dale Dennis in Hastings, Neb., on April 27, 1937. She once said, "I spent my childhood wanting to be Margaret O'Brien and my adolescence wanting to be Gloria Grahame."         She experienced what she called "a moment of truth" at age 14 while watching Kim Stanley and Joanne Woodward in "A Young Lady of Property," one of the masterpieces of the golden days of television.         "I knew then I had to be an actress," Ms. Dennis said.         The award won by Ms. Dennis for her 1967 performance in "Up the Down Staircase" was also misidentified. It was the Moscow Film Festival prize for best actress, not the New York Film Critics' Circle Award.         A corrected obituary appears today on page B14.         Correction:  March 5, 1992, Thursday         An obituary by The Associated Press in some editions yesterday about the actress Sandy Dennis referred incorrectly to the actor Eric Roberts. He is alive. The obituary also included a film incorrectly among her credits. She did not appear in "Same Time, Next Year."       
         Helen Deutsch, the award-winning screenwriter for "Lili," "I'll Cry Tomorrow" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and co-author of "National Velvet," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 years old.         She had been under nursing care and died of natural causes, the medical examiner's office said.         Her script for "Lili" was nominated for an Academy Award in 1953 and won Cannes Film Festival and Writers Guild of America prizes and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Golden Globe award.         The film told of an orphan, played by Leslie Caron, smitten with a carnival magician. One critic, Bosley Crowther, called the movie "lovely and beguiling" and "touched with the magic of romance and the shimmer of masquerade." It later became a musical hit, "Carnival!" on Broadway.         Miss Deutsch, who never learned to type and instead relied on a old Dictaphone, was prolific. Besides her 15 screenplays, she wrote more than 20 short stories for magazines, hundreds of newspaper articles and several plays and television scripts. She was a lyricist as well. Among her songs was "Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo," which she dismissed as "dreadful." Organized Drama Critics Circle         Although not a performer, she played many other roles in show business. Early in her career she ran a theater company, worked as a publicist and covered theater for The New York Herald-Tribune and The New York Times. As a protest to the Pulitzer Prize selections, she organized the New York Drama Critics Circle. She also worked for the New York Theater Guild, and later was a production consultant for stage, film and television.         Her screenwriting career started with a smash. "National Velvet" (1944), which was about youngsters training a horse, was named one of the 10 best films that year and propelled the young Elizabeth Taylor to stardom.         That same year she followed with another acclaimed work, "The Seventh Cross," in which Spencer Tracy gave one of the best performances of his career, portraying a refugee from a Nazi death camp.         Most of her screenplays were for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and were adaptations of other works. Her range was wide, from psychological drama to outdoor adventure to musicals.         "I'll Cry Tomorrow" (1956), featuring Susan Hayward, was the true story of Lillian Roth's searing battle with alcoholism. "King Solomon's Mines" (1950) with Stewart Granger was a scenic safari picture. "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" (1964) was a big, brassy musical about a survivor of the Titanic, and the movie garnered six Oscar nominations.         But her film-writing career ended on a sour note. "Valley of the Dolls" (1967) was a steamy box office success but critically scorned. Miss Deutsch disavowed authorship and said Jacqueline Susann, on whose novel the movie was based, had meddled with the script.         For television she wrote "Jack and the Beanstalk," starring Joel Grey, for NBC in 1956. The following year she wrote "The General Motors 50th Anniversary Show."         Miss Deutsch was born in Manhattan and graduated from Barnard College in 1927. While still a senior, she started managing the Provincetown Players, continuing till the troupe went out of business. She co-wrote a book about it in 1931, "The Provincetown," which was republished in 1972. She took up freelance writing, and her stories appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Redbook.         When Hollywood beckoned, she went to California, living there from about 1946 to 1966. Returning to the East Coast, she called herself "a recluse in New York."         Miss Deutsch was a student of medieval English, French, German and English and a Sanskrit scholar. She collected rare books and manuscripts and donated a significant collection to Boston University.         She had a brief marriage that was annulled. There are no immediate survivors.

         Ellen H. Johnson, an influential art historian and curator who taught at Oberlin College in Ohio for 38 years, died yesterday at her home in Oberlin. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said Elizabeth A. Brown, the curator of modern art at the museum.         At the time of her death, Miss Johnson was emerita professor of art at the college and honorary curator of modern art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin.         On a national level, Miss Johnson was a powerful force in the promotion of contemporary art. She gave the work of several prominent New York artists early exposure through her curatorship of the Allen Art Museum's well-known Young Americans series. She was the first to show the black-striped paintings that established Frank Stella's reputation, and she also exhibited works by Claes Oldenburg, Larry Poons and Bruce Nauman before the artists were widely known. Mr. Oldenburg's first site-specific sculpture, "Three Way Plug," was commissioned by Miss Johnson in 1970 for the Oberlin campus.         Miss Johnson's persistence in seeking out young artists and urging acquisition of their work helped make the Allen Museum one of the country's leading institutions in the contemporary art field. And generations of students, among them Agnes Gund, now the president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, were influenced by the popular course in modern art that she initiated at Oberlin.         Miss Johnson left her eclectic art collection, ranging from Cezanne to the American contemporary artist Judy Pfaff, to the Allen Art Museum, where it is currently on view. In her honor, the main portion of an addition to the museum, designed by Robert Venturi and opened in 1977, was named the Ellen Johnson Gallery of Modern Art.         Ellen Hulda Elizabeth Johnson was born on Nov. 25, 1910, in Warren, Pa. Her affiliation with Oberlin began early. She earned both her undergraduate and master's degrees there, and went on to postgraduate study at Uppsala university in Stockholm and the Sorbonne in Paris.         After a short stint as a lecturer and cataloguer at the Toledo Museum of Art, she returned to Oberlin in 1938 as a part-time instructor, and soon became a member of the regular teaching faculty. Her interest in Scandinavian art also led her to serve as visiting professor in the field at the University of Wisconsin in 1950-51, and to teach American art at Uppsala University in 1960.         In Oberlin, Miss Johnson lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, built for another owner between 1948 and 1950. Over a period of years, she painstakingly restored it and it became a showcase for her collection. She bequeathed the Wright house to Oberlin.         She is survived by a sister, Evelina Johnson McAvoy, of Erie, Pa., and a brother, Harry Johnson, of Warren.       
         Kang Keqing, a veteran of the Communists' Long March and one of the best-known women in China, died today in the capital. She was 80 years old.         The official New China News Agency praised Ms. Kang as "an outstanding leader of the women's movement in China" and said she had died of an unspecified illness.         The report did not mention another important reason for Ms. Kang's fame: she was the widow of Zhu De, a famous revolutionary and military leader who died in 1976.         Ms. Kang's death is a reminder that many of China's most influential leaders are also in their 80's and 90's and in ill health. There have been few deaths in recent years, but many Chinese expect to see a substantial shuffle at the top levels of Government this year because of attrition. Aura of Prestige         Born in September 1911, Ms. Kang was the daughter of a poor fisherman in Jiangxi Province. Accounts vary slightly, but her parents apparently did not want a daughter. They reportedly gave her away when she was about one month old to grow up as a virtual slave in another peasant household.         At the age of 15 she joined the Communist Youth League, and a year later she ran away from her foster parents and a marriage they had arranged for her. She fled to Jinggangshan, a base for Communist guerrillas who were fighting the Nationalist forces led by Chiang Kai-shek.         She married Mr. Zhu, the commander of the Communist forces, whose full name is also spelled Chu De.         When the Nationalists attacked the base in 1934, she joined the Long March, the long and dangerous journey by foot across most of China to a new base in the northwest of the country. The trek took a year, and gave the marchers an aura of prestige that they carried for the rest of their lives. Central Committee Member         "It was just like going out for a stroll every day," she once said, playing down the hunger, sickness and battles that took the lives of many of the participants. Ms. Kang was a soldier, and she carried two pistols and a rifle on the Long March.         After the Communist revolution in 1949, Ms. Kang became a leader of the Women's Federation and entered the National People's Congress. From 1977 through 1985, she was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee.         Ms. Kang was not active in political power struggles, but she appeared periodically to greet children or to congratulate the Women's Federation on various achievements. The New China News Agency did not mention any funeral plans.       
         Sari Dienes, an artist whose career spanned many different media and several decades of the New York art world, died on Monday at her home in Stony Point, N.Y. She was 93 years old.         She died of cancer, said Rip Hayman, a friend and the curator of the Sari Dienes Foundation.         Mrs. Dienes, whose original name was Chylinska von Daivitz, was born in Hungary in 1898 and in her youth studied dance, music and philosophy. She was married at the age of 19 to a French mathematician, Paul Dienes, and she did not decide to become an artist until she was 29 and living in Wales with her husband. Over the next decade, she studied art in Paris and London with Ferdinand Leger, Andre Lhote and Henry Moore. Stranded in New York at the outbreak of World War II, she made the city her home, supporting herself by teaching art.  'Nothing Is So Humble'         As an artist, Mrs. Dienes had an innately experimental approach to materials and techniques and a lasting faith in the power of the found object. "Bones, lint, Styrofoam, banana skins, the squishes and squashes found on the street: nothing is so humble that it cannot be made into art," she once said, and her work tended to prove her right.         During her career she made elaborate rubbings of American Indian petroglyphs and New York City manhole covers, created assemblages out of bones and sundry other materials, painted Abstract Expressionist drip paintings and turned her studio-house in Stony Point, in Rockland County, into a walk-in art environment. When her 57th Street studio burned in 1957, Mrs. Dienes spent two years in Japan studying with a master potter, and thereafter added ceramics to her repertory.         Throughout her career, Mrs. Dienes was a more or less visible fixture on the postwar New York art scene, distinguished in later years by her round, beatific face and halo of frizzy white hair. In the 1950's she exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, a prominent showplace for the Abstract Expressionists, but her work was more in the neo-Dada spirit of younger artists like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg and the composer John Cage, who were her friends.  Influence of Encouragement         In a short reminiscence that appears in a catalogue for an exhibition of Mrs. Dienes's work that is touring Europe, the art dealer Leo Castelli says that in the 1950's, Mrs. Dienes "was very encouraging to the younger artists and gave their new work her seal of approval."         "In this way she exerted a real influence," he adds.         He also notes that Mrs. Dienes gave Mr. Rauschenberg the large stuffed eagle he used in "Canyon," one of his most famous combine paintings.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Dienes became an early member of A.I.R., the first women's cooperative art gallery in the United States. Her most recent exhibition at A.I.R., a retrospective that closed last month, included a number of Styrofoam prints and paintings that the artist made in the 1980's. In her later years she was also the principal owner of the Ear Inn, a bar on Spring Street west of SoHo known for its new music and performance programs.         Mrs. Dienes's husband died in London in 1955. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Sylvia Syms, one of the most admired pop-jazz singers of her generation, died of a heart attack in Manhattan early yesterday morning after a performance in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel. Moments after she had finished singing a program of songs associated with her longtime friend Frank Sinatra, the 74-year-old singer and actress collapsed and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.         "It was at the very end of the second show, and she was getting a standing ovation," said Steve La Spina, her bass player. "She put her right hand up, and the next thing we knew she fell back and hit the ground."         With her deep, grainy contralto, I've-been-through-it-all air of sophistication, and sinuous phrasing that echoed her idol, Billie Holiday, Miss Syms was a quintessential saloon singer, a term she said she preferred to cabaret singer. In the saloon tradition of Mr. Sinatra, she treated everything she sang as an intimate personal communication.         "When you perform it's a one-to-one love affair with the people out there," she once said. "That's how it has to be."         Although she enjoyed only one bona fide pop hit, "I Could Have Danced All Night," from the musical "My Fair Lady," in 1956, among musicians and a coterie of admirers she had a stature that was matched by perhaps only a dozen other veteran popular singers.         Foremost among those admirers was Mr. Sinatra, who produced and conducted her 1982 album of standards, "Syms by Sinatra," for Reprise Records. Not long after they met in the 1940's, Mr. Sinatra gave the plump, moon-faced singer the nickname "Buddha." She in turn referred to him by his full name, Francis Albert. Miss Syms took credit for giving Billie Holiday her trademark gardenia as camouflage after the legendary jazz singer had burned her hair with a curling iron.         Miss Syms was born on Dec. 2, 1917, in Flatbush, Brooklyn. She was only 15 years old when she discovered the jazz clubs of West 52d Street and became friendly with many of the musicians who performed in them. She inaugurated her nightclub career at Kelly's Stable in 1941. Five years later, she made her first recording, "I'm in the Mood for Love," with the Freddie Greene Band. The Clubs and the Labels         It was while appearing at the Cinderella Club in Greenwich Village in 1948 that she was discovered by Mae West, who gave her the part of Flo the Shoplifter in a revival of "Diamond Lil." Favorable notices from the show helped propel her into a dual career in nightclubs and the theater. Her musical comedy roles included Bloody Mary in regional productions of "South Pacific" and Dolly Gallagher Levi in a regional production of "Hello, Dolly!" Her favorite stage role was Gypsy in Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," which she performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and later at Lincoln Center.         In a nightclub career that spanned 51 years, the New York rooms in which she performed included the Bon Soir, the Ruban Bleu, the Living Room, the Village Vanguard, the Cafe Carlyle, Freddy's, Michael's Pub, the Cookery, Marty's, and Eighty-Eight's.         Miss Syms recorded 15 albums for Decca, Columbia, Atlantic and Prestige, among other labels. Her most recent recording, "Along Came Bill," a tribute to the jazz pianist Bill Evans, was released in 1990 on DRG. She recently completed her final recording, "You Must Believe in Spring: The Words of Alan and Marilyn Bergman," which Cabaret Records is to release next month.         She is survived by a brother, Burton Blagman, of Wyckoff, N.J., and a sister, Muriel Bailey of Chesterfield, Mo.         A funeral service is to be held today at 2:30 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Minnie Mazer Nathanson, a philanthropist involved in the founding of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         She died of lymphatic cancer, said her daughter, Bobbie Abrams of Manhattan.         At the time of her death, she was a member of the boards of the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum and chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel-Jewish Association for College Youth.         She and her three brothers and a sister jointly donated the funds for the construction, in the mid-1950's, of the first dormitory at Albert Einstein College. Mrs. Nathanson and her siblings gave the Mazer Building in memory of their father, Abraham Mazer, who died in 1952. Mr. Mazer was a founder and chairman of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company, based in New York City and later sold to Georgia-Pacific.         Over the years, Mrs. Nathanson was also a vice president and trustee of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, an officer of the Council of Jewish Federations and a member of the board of the New York Association for New Americans.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College.         Her husband, Dr. Louis Nathanson, a radiologist and member of the Albert Einstein College faculty, died in 1968.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Dr. Noel Nathanson of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anna Lopin, and a brother, William Mazer, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

         Elsie Driggs, an early practitioner of Precisionist painting, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Driggs, who had been hospitalized for a fractured pelvis, died in her sleep, said her daughter, Merriman Gatch of Manhattan.         In the 1920's, when the American art scene was still forming, Miss Driggs was one of several artists whose images of American cities and factories, painted with a hard-edged but somewhat abstract exactness, earned the name Precisionism. She exhibited at the Daniel Gallery in Manhattan, and in the early 1930's was the first artist invited to join the Public Works of Art Project, the predecessor of the Works Progress Administration, which gave artists work during the Depression.         Miss Driggs was born in Hartford in 1895. She attended the Art Students League in Manhattan between 1918 and 1921, studying with John Sloan and George Luks. A trip to Italy in 1922 exposed her to the work of the Renaissance painter Piero della Francesca, whose classical sense of form influenced her images of machine-age America.         Miss Driggs married the painter Lee Gatch in 1935 and lived with him in New Jersey until his death in 1968, when she moved back to Manhattan. In 1980 she had an exhibition at Martin Diamond Fine Arts. In 1991 the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton organized a retrospective show that also traveled to the Phillips Collection in Washington.         She is survived by her daughter.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Pola Nirenska, a noted teacher and choreographer who danced with Mary Wigman, died on Saturday after a fall from the balcony of her apartment in Bethesda, Md. She was 81 years old.         The death was ruled a suicide by the Montgomery County Medical Examiner.         Miss Nirenska was a major force in dance in Washington, as a teacher, as director of a company whose dancers included Liz Lerman and Sharon Wyrrick (later choreographers in their own right), and as a creator of impressively fashioned dances filled with often raw emotion. Her last piece, presented at Dance Place in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims she had known and was called "In Memory of Those I Loved . . . Who Are No More."  Little Early Training         "Her dances are strong and stark, like massive three-dimensional sculpture in volume and weight," George Jackson, a Washington-based dance critic, said after Miss Nirenska's death. "Her figures are larger than life, but with very distinct personalities."         Miss Nirenska, who was born in Warsaw, insisted on a dance career as a child. She had very little early training, but graduated with honors from a music and dance school in Dresden, Germany, run by Wigman, the influential German Expressionist choreographer. Miss Nirenska performed with Wigman's company during its 1932-33 tour of the United States and Germany. She then embarked on a career as a solo dancer, teacher and choreographer, working in Warsaw, Vienna and Italy. In 1934 the International Dance Congress in Vienna awarded Miss Nirenska a first prize for choreography and a second prize for performing.         At the start of World War II, Miss Nirenska, who was Jewish, immigrated to England, where she gave solo recitals, choreographed musicals and entertained the troops. She also worked there with the choreographers Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder and modeled for the sculptor Jacob Epstein.         Miss Nirenska left for the United States in 1949. She studied in New York with leading American modern-dance choreographers and teachers, among them Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon and Louis Horst. She moved to Washington in 1951 and established a career there as a teacher at local ballet and modern-dance schools and at her own studio, and as a highly regarded choreographer with a company of her own.         Her marriage to Count John Ledesma, an actor and military pilot, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Jan Karski.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Antoinette M. Kraushaar, the owner of one of New York City's oldest art galleries, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes related to old age, said Carole Pesner, the director of Kraushaar Galleries Inc.         Miss Kraushaar was born in Manhattan on Dec. 25, 1902, into a family of art dealers, and she spent her life in the New York art world. While still a teen-ager, she went to work as a stenographer in the gallery that her uncle, Charles W. Kraushaar, founded in 1885 and that her father, John Kraushaar, inherited at his brother's death in 1917. Originally on Broadway at 33d Street, Kraushaar Galleries has moved five times in its 107-year history; since 1981, it has occupied a floor in 724 Fifth Avenue, a gallery building near 57th Street. Mrs. Pesner said yesterday that the gallery would continue to operate.         In its first years, the gallery concentrated on European artists, especially the Barbizon School of landscape painters. Under Miss Kraushaar's father, it became known for its close association with American artists. For many years it was the primary representative of the sculptor Gaston Lachaise, the painters Guy Pene du Bois and Charles Demuth, and several members of the group of American realists known as "the Eight," most notably George Luks, William Glackens, Maurice Prendergast and John Sloan.         In 1917, Luks painted a full-length portrait of Miss Kraushaar in a white graduation dress that has been widely reproduced and exhibited over the years. In the 1920's, Lachaise also sculptured a head of the dealer. Earlier this year, she gave the Luks portrait to the Brooklyn Museum, where it is on view in conjunction with the current exhibition "The Eight."         Miss Kraushaar took over the running of the gallery when her father became ill in the 1930's and became its owner at his death in 1946. She retired from its day-to-day management in 1988. Under her tenure the gallery continued to exhibit American realists. In the last decade, it has mounted large shows of Glackens and Sloan, and it continues to represent the Luks estate. But it also represents abstract artists, including William Kienbusch, Carl Morris and Sonia Gechtoff.         In 1961, Miss Kraushaar was among the handful of New York gallery owners who founded the Art Dealers Association of America; she served for many years on its board. In her later years, she was known for her receptiveness to younger art dealers and the work they exhibited.         She is survived by a nephew, Charles W. Kraushaar of Manhattan.       
         Ruth Nelson, an actress in the legendary Group Theater that transformed American acting and whose career on stage, film and television spanned nearly 70 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer complicated by a stroke and pneumonia, her family said.         Ms. Nelson began acting in the early 1920's and last appeared onstage in "Uncle Vanya" in New York last year and on film in the 1990 movie "Awakenings."         During the 1930's she was a charter member of the Group, which gave birth to modern American acting. The Group infused its work with new psychological insights, naturalistic style and political content. It produced many top actors, directors and acting teachers, including Lee J. Cobb, Morris Carnovsky, John Garfield, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Stella Adler and Lee Strasburg, and led to new techniques, including the Method. 'They Couldn't Applaud Any More'         In a great moment of theater history, Ms. Nelson was the taxicab driver's wife in the original cast of Clifford Odets' "Waiting for Lefty." On opening night in 1935, the audience gave an extraordinary 45-minute ovation.         "When they couldn't applaud any more, they stomped their feet," she later recalled. "All I could think was, 'My God, they're going to bring the balcony down!' It was terrible, it was so beautiful."         For 33 years she was married to John Cromwell, founder of the Screen Directors Guild. Among his directing credits were "Of Human Bondage," in which Miss Nelson played the wife, "Algiers," "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" and "The Goddess."         But when Mr. Cromwell was accused of Communism in the 1950's -- a charge he denied in Congressional testimony -- his career went into a blacklisted eclipse. At the time, Ms. Nelson was offered a New York stage role as a wife in what turned out to be a monumental play, "Death of a Salesman." She turned it down to stay in Los Angeles to help her husband through his ordeal.         Mr. Cromwell died in 1979. A Nun's Encouragement         Born in Flint, Mich., Ms. Nelson grew up on the vaudeville circuit with her mother, Eva Mudge, a noted quick-change artist. Then she went to Los Angeles to study at a Roman Catholic school. Although her mother had discouraged Ms. Nelson from a show business career, a nun saw her potential and nudged her to Broadway.         Her stage performances won critical praise. Her film debut came in 1944 in four movies, and she made nine more in the next four years. Her later films included Robert Altman's "3 Women" and "Wedding" in the 1970's.         In a 1966 review in The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote that her portrayal of Mrs. Antrobus in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth" was "very easily the best" he had seen. "Miss Nelson misses no nuance of reality that the part offers, and in one moment -- when she mourns her murdered son Abel -- she touches true elegy," he wrote.         Her first marriage, to actor William Challee, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two sisters, Linda Stack of Darien, Conn., and Gay Samuelson of Los Angeles; a stepson, James Cromwell of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.

         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Audre Lorde, a black feminist writer who became the poet laureate of New York State in 1991, died on Tuesday at her home on St. Croix. She was 58 years old.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Blanche Cook.         Ms. Lorde had had cancer for 14 years and in 1980 wrote "The Cancer Journals," which traced the first stages of her disease.         From the publication of her first book in 1968, Ms. Lorde's 17 volumes of poetry, essays and autobiography reflected her hatred of racial and sexual prejudice. Among them are "Cables to Rage" (1970); "Coal" (1976); "Zami: A New Spelling of My Name" (1983), and, most recently, "Undersong: Chosen Poems Old and New," which was recently published by W. W. Norton.         A collection of essays, "A Burst of Light," won an American Book Award in 1989. Her 1973 collection, "From a Land Where Other People Live," was nominated for a National Book Award.  Active Politically and Academically         Ms. Lorde, who also used her adopted African name, Gamba Adisa, was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Library Science. She became an English professor at Hunter and lectured widely throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. She was active in many literary and political organizations and a founding member of Women of Color Press and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa.         She was an outspoken lesbian and served on the board of the Feminist Press in New York City and often gave readings of her works at Judith's Room, a feminist bookstore in Greenwich Village.         Among her honors were the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit in 1991, making her the poet laureate of New York; the Manhattan Borough President's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1988, and honorary doctorates from Hunter, Oberlin and Haverford Colleges.         Her marriage to Edwin Rollins ended in divorce.         She is survived by her companion, Gloria I. Joseph of St. Croix; a son, Jonathan Rollins, and a daughter, Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, both of New York City, and four sisters, Helen Lorde, Phyllis Blackwell and Marjorie and Mavis Jones.       
         Ilse Sass, a pianist and voice teacher, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old and lived in New York City         She died of a pulmonary embolism, said her sister, Leine Seligmann.         Miss Sass was born in Cologne, Germany, and studied at the music conservatory there. She taught piano for many years at the Henry Street Settlement and taught voice for 20 years at Juilliard and at the Manhattan School of Music.         She gave concerts for the blind and worked with blind singers. She also appeared as a piano teacher in the movie "Fame."         Her sister is her only survivor.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Several thousand friends, admirers and family members filled Riverside Church yesterday to celebrate the life and to mourn the death of Clara M. Hale, the woman who sheltered and raised hundreds of abandoned and orphaned children in her home.         The service, an afternoon of heart-felt tributes, seemed to offer solace to those who were most touched by her example. Mother Hale, as she was widely known, died last Friday of complications from a stroke. She was 87 years old.         "Our lady of inner-city royalty," was the title given her by Percy E. Sutton, the businessman and former Manhattan Borough President, who in 1975 helped Mrs. Hale find and renovate a Harlem brownstone on West 122d Street which became Hale House, only a half-dozen blocks from Riverside Church. His description prompted a string of "amens" that rippled through the listeners.         Standing amid the seasonal red and green of bright poinsettias and fragrant Christmas pines, Mr. Sutton and others recalled Mrs. Hale's capacity for loving each of her children, for placing mirrors at toddler's eye level in Hale House, for taking the frailest of babies into her own room overnight. 'We're Almost Home'         A noonday mist dampened the gray stone on the outside walls of the church facing the Hudson River along Riverside Drive, but inside, song from the lips of the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Gospel Choir seemed to reach up toward the rich blue of the church's stained glass windows.         "We're almost home," sang the 30-member choir, many of whom came of age, and mind, at Hale House. They swayed back and forth in red and yellow robes as they sang: "I'm so tired and weary, no more do I want to roam."         The service, which lasted 100 minutes, opened with a procession of so many politicians, community leaders and members of Mrs. Hale's extended family that it took more than 10 minutes for them just to file in and be seated. Mayor David N. Dinkins, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Yoko Ono were among those in the procession.         A coffin of light-colored poplar was wheeled to the front of the church during the service. Afterward, it was guarded by a detail of the Harlem Youth Marine Cadets outside before it was taken for burial. Mrs. Hale's family asked that the location be kept private.         "Woe to those who thought this woman old and frail," said Mayor Dinkins, who was greeted by a standing ovation when he went to the pulpit. "She had twice the stamina of most others.         "The best tribute we can give is to keep her legacy alive," he added, saying that efforts would be made to fulfill Mrs. Hale's wish to establish a hospice for dying children at Hale House. Quoting the poet Langston Hughes, he concluded: "Beautiful also are the souls of my people. Mother, may you rest in peace." 'Like She Knew'         Mr. Sutton recalled his fondest memory of Mrs. Hale, which was when she rose to acknowledge the applause she received from Congress in 1985, after being cited as a "true American hero" in a State of the Union address by President Ronald Reagan.         "She rose gently, with the smile she always gave, like she knew that she owned everything," Mr. Sutton said. He described her reluctance at first to appear with Mr. Reagan because the President, as Mr. Sutton put it, "was not being too kind to people in the neighborhood where she lived." She resisted the invitation with the excuse that she was ill, but after the White House insisted that her daughter, Lorraine, appear in her place, Mrs. Hale eventually gave in.         Among the day's speakers was the Rev. Carolyn Knight, Mrs. Hale's pastor at the Philadelphia Baptist Church.         "She touched children no one else would touch," Ms. Knight said. "She showed us that what children really need is a hug and a kiss and a smile.         "In this season, when much is spoken of angels sent from God, Mother Hale was an angel," she said.         Ms. Knight recalled speaking with Mrs. Hale in a quiet moment about a year ago.         "She said: 'Carolyn, do you believe God knows my way? Do you believe I will go to heaven when I die ?' "         Ms. Knight closed the service with a final goodbye, provoking tears in the eyes of many listeners: "Farewell, farewell, you gentle lovely lady, we shall meet again."       
         Dr. Helene Wallace Toolan, a cancer researcher, died on Sunday at Southwestern Vermont Hospital Center in Bennington. She was 80 years old and lived in Old Bennington, Vt.         She died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her family said.         Dr. Toolan, a native of Chicago, graduated with honors from the University of Chicago at the age of 17 and received a Ph.D. in pathology from Cornell Medical Center. She was on the staff of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York from 1950 until 1964.         Dr. Toolan did basic research on the transplantation of human tumors and tissues into laboratory animals. In 1955 she received the Sloan Award for her work. Linked Cancers to Virus         She also studied the relationship between viruses and human cancer cells, leading a team of researchers that succeeded in linking viruses to eight types of human cancer in 1960. Previously only leukemia, a cancer affecting the blood, had been linked to a virus.         In 1964 Dr. Toolan moved to Bennington to direct the newly established Putnam Memorial Institute for Medical Research. In 1987 the institute was renamed the Helene W. Toolan Institute for Medical Research. She became director emeritus and senior scientist of the institute in 1978 and director emeritus and trustee in 1985.         Dr. Toolan was also an avid gardener, horticulturist and ornithologist, and participated in a project to beautify downtown Bennington in the early 1970's. The Garden Club of America gave her its Horticulural Award in 1982.         Her first husband, Dr. Edward Wallace, died in 1943. She later married Dr. James M. Toolan, who survives her. Also surviving are two sons, Robin Wallace of Gainesville, Fla., and Alan Wallace of Las Vegas, Nev.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Callaghan Candaele St. Aubin, the speedy outfielder whose swing won one batting title and inspired two movies about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died Tuesday night at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., at age 69. She died of breast cancer, according to her son Kelly Candaele, whose 1988 documentary about his mother's career, "A League of Their Own," inspired last summer's movie of the same name.         During her four seasons in the women's league that was formed in 1943 as a wartime alternative to the talent-depleted men's league, Mrs. St. Aubin, who played under her original name, Helen Callaghan, batted .257 and stole 354 bases in 388 games.         Mrs. St. Aubin was a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, who had been recruited at a Canadian softball tournament. Accompanied by her sister, Margie, who was sent by their father to keep an eye on her, she broke in with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes in 1944 and was an immediate star. She stole 112 bases in 111 games, and her .287 batting average was the league's second highest.         In 1945, when the team moved to Indiana and became the Fort Wayne Daisies, Mrs. St. Aubin, a left-handed batter, led the league with a .299 average and in extra-base hits (24), doubles (17) and home runs (3).         She became ill in 1946 and sat out the 1947 season before returning for part of the 1948 season, her last, and she was never again as sharp at the plate. But she stole 114 bases in 111 games in 1946.         Her former teammate Dottie Collins recalled yesterday how deceptive her appearance was on the field.         "When she was playing -- running or throwing -- she looked so dainty, that's the only word for it," said Mrs. Collins, who recalled the 5-foot-1 1/4-inch, 115-pound outfielder as a "tiny" woman who was "strong."         According to Mrs. Collins, the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, Mrs. St. Aubin's stance and swing are almost perfectly preserved in her son Casey Candaele, a switch-hitting infielder for the Houston Astros.         She married Bobby Candaele during her career and gave birth to the first of their five sons before the 1948 season. They settled in Lompoc, Calif., where she became a cleaning staff supervisor at a local hospital. She and Mr. Candaele were eventually divorced, and she later married Ronald J. St. Aubin.         The documentary Kelly Candaele and his friend Kim Wilson made in 1988 led directly to the movie starring Geena Davis and directed by Penny Marshall.
