         Dr. Ruth Whittemore, a Yale professor who conducted groundbreaking research in pediatric cardiology based on data from clinics she founded in 1940's, died on Dec. 27 in North Branford, Conn. She was 84.         In 1947, at the request of the federal Children's Bureau, Dr. Whittemore set up the first rheumatic fever and cardiac clinic in New England, at the Yale Medical School. Rheumatic fever, which can lead to heart failure if untreated, was common in young children then. But with the advent of penicillin, its incidence began to decline, and Dr. Whittemore shifted her focus to congenital heart disease, a relatively new field then.         Many doctors she trained at her clinic went on to become leading pediatric cardiologists, said Dr. Paul Lurie, a retired specialist in the field.         ''Congenital heart disease was a totally unexplored area at the time she was running her clinic,'' Dr. Lurie said. ''Her clinic was one of the first to specialize in it.''         Dr. Whittemore set up two similar clinics in Connecticut and followed her young patients closely, tracking many into adulthood. The information she collected on her patients in the years she tracked them proved extremely important. In the early 50's, she began a research study in which she examined the health histories of 837 children born to 427 of her former patients and discovered that 10 percent of the children had congenital heart abnormalities.         At a time when genetic predisposition to heart disease was not completely understood, Dr. Whittemore's data showed that children whose parents had heart disease were at a higher risk of developing the disease than the general population. Her study challenged previous smaller studies that concluded there was a much lower risk of inheriting heart disease from a parent.         Born in Newton, Mass., Ruth Whittemore completed her undergraduate studies at Mount Holyoke and earned her medical degree at Johns Hopkins as one of six women in a class of 72.         Two years later, she was part of a team of physicians at Hopkins that performed the first ''blue baby'' operation, a surgical procedure that corrected a congenital heart abnormality that robs the blood of oxygen.         Dr. Whittemore joined the Yale Medical School faculty in 1943. In 45 years there, she held several positions, including director of pediatric cardiology.         She was the author or co-author of more than 50 scholarly papers.         She is survived by her sister-in-law, Margaret Keagy Whittemore of Cape Cod, Mass.; one nephew; and three nieces.       
         Robin Anderson, an Australian filmmaker whose award-winning documentaries ranged from examinations of tribal life in Papua New Guinea to social and political controversies in Australia, died here on March 8. She was 51.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         With her husband, Bob Connolly, Ms. Anderson made five full-length films on difficult, seemingly unpromising issues, each of which took several years to film.         The latest, ''Facing the Music'' (2001), about student and employee campaigns at Sydney University to defend the music faculty against being dismantled by financial cutbacks, received its premiere at the Sydney Film Festival in June on the day after Ms. Anderson's illness had been diagnosed as fatal. She lived long enough to know that a private benefactor who saw the film offered money to save the music school.         Ms. Anderson, born in Perth, Western Australia, earned a degree in economics in Australia before receiving a master's in sociology from Columbia University. After two years in New York, she returned to Australia as a television researcher and married Mr. Connolly, a director of documentaries and profiles of rural life for public television.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Anderson is survived by her brother, Michael, and her daughters Katherine, 14, and Joanna, 10.         The first Anderson-Connolly film, ''First Contact,'' made from 1980 to '82, was nominated for an Academy Award. It introduced the couple and their audiences to remote regions of Papua New Guinea.         The film's success led the team to make ''Joe Leahy's Neighbors'' (1989), about the political and cultural struggles of a mixed-race coffee planter, and ''Black Harvest'' (1992), about land and money disputes and their escalation into tribal warfare.         The films established the team's international reputation, with each one winning a major prize at the Cinéma du Réel festival, which honors documentaries.         Their best-known work, assembled from hundreds of hours of candid film, was ''Rats in the Ranks'' (1996), an often hilarious close-up look at small-town political infighting. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that ''Rats in the Ranks'' appreciates ''the dauntless energy and sheer Shakespearean conniving it takes to stay afloat'' in the ''shark-infested waters'' of local politics.       
         Shelley Mydans, a journalist who with her husband, the photographer Carl Mydans, covered the war in Asia in World War II and later wrote a novel based on their 21 months in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, died on Thursday in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 86.         Mrs. Mydans was the author of three novels and co-author of a nonfiction book. She and her husband were Life magazine's first photographer-reporter team to cover the war.         Shelley Smith Mydans was born on May 20, 1915, in Palo Alto, Calif., the daughter of a professor of journalism at Stanford University.         After attending Stanford, she worked briefly for The Literary Digest and then joined the staff of Life magazine as a researcher-reporter. She met Mr. Mydans, a Life photographer, and they were married in 1938. In 1939 they were sent together to Europe. They stayed until the fall of France and then were sent to Chongqing, China, to report on the Sino-Japanese war and, after that, to the Western Pacific.         At the time of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, they were based in Manila and were taken prisoner when Japanese forces arrived. After nearly two years in captivity, they were returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Mrs. Mydans's first novel, ''The Open City,'' published in 1945, was based on the experiences of Americans captured by the Japanese.         After their release, she and her husband both returned to the Philippines. At the end of the war she moved to New York, becoming a commentator for a Time Inc. radio news program and writing for Time and Life; when Mr. Mydans was bureau chief for Time and Life in Tokyo, she also reported from there.         Her other books were ''Thomas,'' a novel based on the life of Thomas à Becket; ''The Vermilion Bridge,'' a novel about eighth-century Japan; and ''The Violent Peace,'' a report on wars, insurgency and terrorism  since World War II, which she wrote with Mr. Mydans.         Mrs. Mydans is survived by her husband; their son, Seth, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times; their daughter, Shelley, known as Misty, of Sacramento, Calif.; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.       
         Elaine Crispen Sawyer, a trusted aide to the former first lady Nancy Reagan who parried with the news media over things like Mrs. Reagan's borrowed gowns and her consultations with an astrologer, died Tuesday.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, relatives said. She was 62 and lived in Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Sawyer, a public relations specialist, was at Mrs. Reagan's side throughout the Reagan presidency, serving four years as the first lady's special assistant and four years as her press secretary. She played an important role in the small team that  shaped Mrs. Reagan's trademark ''just say no'' to drugs campaign.         An employee who became a loyal friend and confidante of Mrs. Reagan, Mrs. Sawyer complained that the news media were quick to find fault with the first lady.         As press secretary, she was called upon to explain Mrs. Reagan's consultations with a California astrologer, Joan Quigley. When Mrs. Reagan did not report the loans of expensive dresses by top designers, Mrs. Sawyer was out front to concede that the first lady ''broke her own rule.''         Mrs. Reagan called Mrs. Sawyer ''a dear friend'' who shared many joyful and sad moments, including the times when Mrs. Reagan learned she had breast cancer and when her mother died.         ''It's hard to believe that she won't be here tomorrow when I want to pick up the phone and just catch up on the news,'' Mrs. Reagan said.         Born near Detroit, Mrs. Sawyer moved to California at 25 to work in public relations under Michael K. Deaver, who later became President Reagan's deputy chief of staff. She was deeply impressed by Mr. Reagan's presence and joined his campaign for governor, then moved to Washington with the Reagans in 1980, said her daughter, Cheryl Crispen of Alexandria.         In addition to Ms. Crispen, survivors include Mrs. Sawyer's husband of 10 years, George A. Sawyer of Alexandria; three stepchildren, Nancy Sawyer, Jeffrey Sawyer and Debra Moulton; and six grandchildren.       
         Faye Dancer, whose home runs and spontaneous cartwheels in the women's professional baseball league of the 1940's helped to earn her the nickname All the Way Faye, died May 22 in Los Angeles. She was 77 and lived in Westchester, Calif.         She died of complications of surgery to remove organs because of cancer, said her brother, Richard Dancer, her only survivor.         Dancer was the inspiration for All the Way Mae, the character portrayed by Madonna in the 1992 film ''A League of Their Own.'' It told the story of the women's baseball league established in 1943 as a substitute for the men's professional game if major leaguers were drafted.         Dancer was the first in the league to hit two homers in one game, stole 108 bases in 1948 and was described as a fly-catching genius by the sportswriters of the day. Her spikes and gloves are on display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., where a picture shows her sliding flamboyantly into third base.         Lavonne Davis, her friend since childhood and a professional teammate then known as Pepper Paire, remembered Dancer's superb fielding: at the crack of the bat, she would turn and dart to the exact spot the ball would come down, catch it over her shoulder and throw a strike to home plate.         ''I never saw any woman or man do it any better,'' she said.         In a league in which teams went by names like Chicks and Peaches, her appeal was not hurt by her appearance in the demure skirts -- in colors like bubblegum pink and never more than six inches above the knee, as mandated by the league. Lois Browne, in the book ''Girls of Summer: In Their Own League'' (HarperCollins, 1992), said she was ''a pretty freckle-faced blond gypsy'' for whom nothing was too outrageous, including swan dives into mud puddles.         ''I was forever having fun, raising my skirt up for the fans, doing the splits and handstands when the games got quiet,'' she said in 1992 in an interview with The Independent, the London newspaper.         Faye Katherine Dancer was born in Santa Monica on April 24, 1925. Her father read water meters for the city of Los Angeles. She grew up in West Los Angeles, where she loved playing sports. Davis said she first noticed her in elementary school when an errant soccer ball went whizzing by her head and hit another girl in the stomach.         The teacher who escorted Faye to the principal's office declared, ''From now on, you're going to have to play kickball with the boys.''         In high school, she played softball for a girls' team called the Dr Peppers, sponsored by the soft-drink company. In 1944 she and Davis came to the attention of a scout for the All-American Girls Ball League, a hybrid of softball and baseball.         The league had been founded the year before by Philip W. Wrigley, the chewing-gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs. He feared that major leaguers would be drafted; minor leaguers were already being called up. Teams of girls (never called women) seemed like a way to fill ballparks, according to an article in Smithsonian magazine in 1989.         The league began with four teams of 15, playing in medium-size cities in the industrial Midwest. It was successful enough that by the next year players were being recruited nationally. California, where die-hards like Dancer practiced slides on the beaches, was a natural source of talent, Davis said.         The women, who had an average age of 20, found themselves rattling around the Midwest playing a game that more and more resembled baseball. By 1945 the league was called the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. By 1948 pitching was overhand, and the space between bases had increased from 70 to 85 feet, just 5 feet short of the men's distance.         The game clearly outgrew its original role as insurance against an interruption of the men's game. In the late 1940's a million customers paid $1.50 to watch 10 teams play.         Players had games every day and doubleheaders on Sundays and holidays, and rattled from town to town in clunky buses. They were still expected to display a femininity that combined something of the girl next door with a dash of class. Representatives of the Helena Rubinstein Company ran a charm school that taught how to put on makeup and how to charm a date.         There were also chaperones, who were resented for their lack of baseball knowledge. A player going to bat at a tense moment was once restrained by the chaperone, who made her put on lipstick first.         Dancer, who played center field and sometimes pitched for the Minneapolis Millerettes, the Fort Wayne Daisies and the Peoria Redwings, found room to display a remarkably free spirit. She bedeviled the chaperones with stunts like smearing Limburger cheese on light bulbs in their rooms, according to the Browne book. To dodge league rules against drinking, she would invite teammates to cemeteries to drink beer, the Smithsonian said.         She handled the male groupies of the league, known as Locker Room Leonards, like easy pop flies. For a time, she dated a gangster who drove a bulletproof Packard to her road games and offered to buy her a palomino horse, before suddenly disappearing, the book said. She accepted a diamond ring from another would-be suitor, mounted the stone in a nicer band and ditched him.         She left baseball in 1950 because of a back injury, caused by a collision with a shortstop, Davis said. The league was disbanded in 1954, in part because baseball was televised.         Dancer worked as an electronics technician and lived in Santa Monica until moving in with her brother two years ago. Before the 1992 movie about the women's league, United Press International reported that she met with Madonna at the home of Penny Marshall, the director, to discuss the part.         Dancer had a fiancé named Johnny, but he died in World War II. Davis said she never really considered marrying anybody else, despite other admirers.         One was a man who saw her picture in Life magazine, according to the Smithsonian. ''I am not proposing,'' he wrote, ''but I have about $1,000 and an old jalopy in New Jersey, I am footloose and fancy free, and I can settle any place.''       
         Millie Deegan, who pitched and played second base for the Rockford Peaches in the women's professional baseball league of the 1940's, died on July 21 at her home in New Port Richey, Fla. She was 82.         The cause was metastatic breast cancer, her niece Joan Barker said.         In the 1992 movie, ''A League of Their Own,'' a character based on Deegan is the relief pitcher in the film's climactic game. Her team was beaten in the real game, the final of the 1946 championship series of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, despite getting 13 hits. The Racine Belles' single run in the 16th inning was enough to beat the Peaches.         The women's league was started in 1943 by Philip K. Wrigley, the chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs, as a substitute for major league baseball if major leaguers were drafted. The league was disbanded in 1954.         Deegan played for 10 years, first for Rockford and then for the Kenosha Comets, for the Fort Wayne Daisies and finally for Rockford again. As a batter, her lifetime average was .280. As a pitcher, she had an earned run average of 2.36.         Lavonne Davis, who played catcher in the league as Pepper Paire, remembered Deegan best as a pitcher.         ''She had no speed but had stuff and good location,'' she said. ''She was a good hardnosed ballplayer.''         Mildred Eleanor Deegan was born on Dec. 11, 1919, in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Her father's job was polishing the silver at the Biltmore Hotel in Manhattan. She excelled in track and field at Lincoln High School, and after graduation played amateur softball with a team called the Americanettes.         In an exhibition softball game at Madison Square Garden, she hit a home run that went 260 feet. Babe Ruth, who was at the arena, posed with her and squeezed her biceps; she was called ''the Babe Ruth of women's softball.''         She moved to Chicago, where she tried out for the Rockford Peaches, treating it as kind of a joke, according to her niece. When she was told she had been accepted, Deegan decided not to tell management that she had a sprained finger. She played with the injury.         She was one of the original players in the league in 1943 and played until 1952. She then moved to Florida and became a portrait photographer.         Ms. Deegan moved to Winston-Salem, N.C., and began working as a secretary for the Western Electric Company. From there she went back to Brooklyn for a short time before moving to Rahway, N.J., and working in Newark for Western Electric.         She coached the Linden, N.J., Arians, a team in the Eastern Major Girls Softball League. The manager was Margaret Nusse, Ms. Deegan's companion and her only survivor.       
         Edith Lutyens Bel Geddes, a costume designer for theater, ballet and film and a theatrical producer, died on Aug. 16 at her home in Hudson, N.Y. She was 95.         Known as Edith Lutyens for much of her professional career, she made and designed costumes for theater productions of ''The Crucible,'' ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Dear Me, the Sky Is Falling'' and ''The Deputy.''         She created costumes for stars like Katharine Cornell, in a 1947 production of ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' and for Orson Welles and his lavish 1946 stage production of ''Around the World in 80 Days.''         Ms. Lutyens had a costume shop in New York, where she helped create costumes for several Ballet Theater productions, among them Antony Tudor's ''Dim Luster'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Fancy Free,'' working with Motley, the British design team, and designers who included Kermit Love and Miles White. Her designs for ''The Clowns,'' choreographed in 1968 by Gerald Arpino, played an important role in establishing that ballet's fantastical atmosphere.         In a review in The New York Times, Clive Barnes described the costumes as having ''the white floppiness of Beardsley and the bedraggled poetry of Picasso saltimbanques.''         Ms. Lutyens was also a producer of the 1947 Broadway presentation of Gian Carlo Menotti's ''Medium'' and ''Telephone,'' working in partnership with the industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, her husband, and the producer Blevins Davis. She was also associated with the producer Cheryl Crawford and Eva Le Gallienne and her American Repertory Theater. Ms. Lutyens was also a costume consultant to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.         Her life offstage was at least as colorful as anything she designed or produced. Born in Brussels, Ms. Lutyens grew up in London, but then returned to Belgium and became a fencing champion.         During World War II she opened a dress shop in London, where she came to Motley's attention. In the United States she became a real estate broker while continuing her design business.         She was divorced from her first husband, Archibald Lutyens. Her marriages to Moseley Taylor and Bel Geddes ended with their deaths. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Nancy Chaffee Whitaker, a leading tennis player in the 1950's who won three consecutive national indoor championships, died Sunday in Coronado, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Indian Wells, Calif.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her husband, the sportscaster Jack Whitaker.         In the early 50's, Nancy Chaffee vied for tennis supremacy with figures like Maureen Connolly, Althea Gibson, Margaret Osborne duPont, Doris Hart, Louise Brough and Shirley Fry.         She was the national indoor titleholder from 1950 to 1952, defeating Gibson, Beverly Baker and Patricia Todd in the finals, long before the open era and the advent of huge prize money. The indoor tournaments were played on the boards at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan before perhaps 2,000 fans at the final rounds.         ''What did I win?'' Chaffee Whitaker said in a 1993 interview. ''A little silver ball and a silver ashtray with a glass base, and I don't even smoke. No money.''         Comparing the modern game with her era, she said: ''There are more better players. When I was playing I was an automatic almost into the semifinals of any tournament. That's just the way it was, a gap between the few top players and the rest. And there was no qualifying for tournaments.''         The daughter of a tennis instructor and a native of Ventura, Calif., she played on the men's tennis team at the University of Southern California because there was no women's squad. While a sophomore, she captured the 1947 United States girls' lawn tennis singles championship and teamed with Baker to win the doubles title.         She emerged in the national spotlight in 1950, reaching the singles quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the singles semifinals of the United States nationals -- the forerunner of the United States Open -- in addition to winning the first of her indoor championships.         In 1951, she teamed with Todd in doubles at the nationals, losing in the final to Fry and Hart, and she played doubles on the 1951 Wightman Cup team that defeated Britain, 6-1.         She was married in October 1951 to Ralph Kiner, the Pittsburgh Pirates' slugger and future Hall of Famer, and retired from most tournament play after winning the 1952 indoor title, devoting herself to rearing a family.         She was later a sports commentator for ABC, developed tennis programs at resorts and helped found the Cartier tennis tournament in Long Island's Hamptons to benefit the American Cancer Society.         In addition to Whitaker, whom she married in 1991, she is survived by three children from her marriage to Kiner, the longtime Mets broadcaster; sons Michael and Scott Kiner, and a daughter, Kathryn Freeman, all of Palm Desert, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Erna Furman, an expert on grief in children and a child psychoanalyst who helped develop a teamwork therapy involving teachers, parents and therapists, died on Aug. 9 in Cleveland. She was 76.         The cause was lung cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, where she worked for about 50 years.         The Perkins Center used psychoanalytic ideas to help children deal with emotional problems and incorporated the idea of team treatment, which helped parents understand children's actions.         Mrs. Furman wrote, edited and contributed to books based on research at the center.         The book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement,'' which she worked on with the psychoanalyst Dr. Anna Freud in the 1970's, challenged the idea that children who lose a parent do not need the same attention that adults do. She showed that even toddlers can be helped to mourn a parent. The work won the American Medical Writers Association Book Award in 1975.         Mrs. Furman's book ''Toddlers and Their Mothers'' describes her findings from a 1980's research project on the importance of the mother-child relationship, particularly in the second and third years of life.         Mrs. Furman was born Erna Mary Poppe in Vienna on June 14, 1926. In 1938, her family fled to Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. Four years later, however, she was sent to the Terezin concentration camp, near Prague.         While there, she kept a journal and drew portraits of other captives, many of them children whom she befriended and helped care for. Some of her drawings were later exhibited, to critical acclaim, in museums, including ones in Tokyo and Los Angeles.         Mrs. Furman, who was educated at the Academy of Commerce in Prague, came to the United States in the late 1940's. She received many honors for her contributions to child psychoanalysis and was made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1999.         Dr. Robert Furman, her husband of 48 years and her colleague, died Sept. 21 at 78. He was known for helping develop the Hannah Perkins Center and the Cleveland Center for Research in Child Development. He was the first director of the Hannah Perkins Center.         ''In many ways, it was the couple together, Dr. and Mrs. Furman, who made the Hannah Perkins Center what it is today,'' said Barbara Streeter, the center's therapy director.         The Furmans are survived by two daughters, Lydia Furman Peter of Cleveland and Tanya Furman Larson of State College, Pa.; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  October 9, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Sept. 30 about Erna Furman, a child psychoanalyst and an expert on grief, gave a misspelled name in some references to the center where she practiced. It is the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, not Hannah. Because of an editing error, Mrs. Furman's maiden name was misspelled. It was Popper, not Poppe. The article misstated the timing of Mrs. Furman's immigration to the United States. It occurred in the 1950's, not the 40's.         The obituary also misstated the role of the psychoanalyst Anna Freud in Mrs. Furman's book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement.'' Dr. Freud wrote an introduction; she did not contribute to the text.       
         Elizabeth Coblentz, an Amish homemaker who wrote a syndicated cooking column by hand beneath a kerosene lantern, a kitchen chronicle that touched on everything from the merits of Belgian horses to coping with grief, died on Tuesday in Blue Springs, Mo. She was 66.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Kevin Williams, her editor at Oasis Newsfeatures, which distributed her column to 105 newspapers, with more than two million readers.         A member of the strict Old Order Amish, who avoid most modern conveniences, she lived on a farm near Geneva, Ind., without running water, electricity, plumbing or a telephone. She traveled primarily by horse-drawn buggy, sewed her family's clothes and canned fruits and vegetables. She answered questions many readers had never thought to ask, including how to cook a meal for 76 children.         She mailed in her weekly columns, but Mr. Williams sometimes did not have time to mail his editing questions, so he would wire daisies with a card enclosed. One asked: ''How much sugar in that cream pie recipe?'' Mr. Williams had prepaid Express Mail envelopes at her home in which she could reply.         Mrs. Coblentz's columns seemed to be ripped from the pages of a 19th-century church bulletin, with their descriptions of quilting bees, children's funerals, sleigh rides and walking barefoot in warm spring soil. She told of baking 70 pies and 14 plates of ''nothings,'' a traditional Amish pastry, for her daughter's wedding.         In one column -- she called them letters -- she described a day that began at 4 a.m. with cooking breakfast of fried potatoes, eggs and bacon. The 11 a.m. entry: ''Went in to get dinner, as I've got menfolk working hard, hauling loads and loads of manure with the manure spreader that is driven by a team of horses.''         Her religious faith was a constant theme. But food, of the most comfortable kind, was her main topic, from Aunt Hilty's cinnamon rolls to putting up pumpkin pickles to churning a double batch of hot pepper butter. Among her recipes were those for sauerkraut bread, watermelon preserves and dandelion jelly.         The overall effect of her columns was an insight into the way of life and fundamental values of the Amish.         ''You would not notice much difference in our life now from when I was a girl or my mother was a girl,'' Mrs. Coblentz said in an Associated Press interview in 2000.         Elizabeth Coblentz was born in Berne, Ind., on July 18, 1936. She had six sisters and one brother and grew up on a farm. She left school after ninth grade, in accordance with Amish custom. She worked in a sugar factory, cleaned houses and married young. Starting in 1952, she wrote community news for a nationally distributed Amish newspaper.         Mr. Williams discovered her in 1991, after having done a research paper on the Amish as a college freshman. After having the idea of an Amish cooking column, he ran into Mrs. Coblentz by chance.         The first newspaper to take the column was The Quincy Herald-Whig of Quincy, Ill. It now appears in papers from Newton, N.J., to Indianapolis to Tacoma. But Mrs. Coblentz's picture does not appear with it. Following Amish tradition rooted in biblical passages that decry ''graven images,'' she refused to be photographed, appear on television or allow her voice to be taped.         But she had nothing against personal appearances and was on a publicity tour to promote her new book when she died. The book, ''The Amish Cook: Recipes and Recollections From an Old Order Amish Family,'' is to be published in November by Ten Speed Press of Berkeley, Calif. Her earlier work, ''The Best of the Amish Cook,'' a collection of her newspaper columns, was published by Oasis in two volumes.         On her tour, she traveled with Mr. Williams by car, as the Amish faith permits people to use technology as long as it does not intrude on their lives, he said. Owning an auto was out of the question for Mrs. Coblentz, Mr. Williams said, because it would have brought the whole world within her reach. Riding with someone is a compromise most Amish are willing to make, he said.         Her husband, Benjamin, a carpenter, died in 2000, throwing her into a depression that Mr. Williams said he believes led to her death. More than 3,000 readers sent cards and 5,000 sent e-mail messages to the syndicate that distributed her column.         She is survived by her daughters, Leah Shetler, Verena and Susan Coblentz, Elizabeth Wengerd, Lovina Eicher and Emma Schwartz, all of Geneva; her sons, Amos of Berne and Albert of Geneva; her sisters, Leah Girod of Berne, Lovina Swartzentruber of LaGrange, Ind., Emma Schwartz of Berne and Salome Hilty and Barbara Schwartz, both of Geneva; her brother, Chris A. Graber of Bryant, Ind.; and 35 grandchildren.         Many of her readers seemed to feel close to her. In a letter before Mrs. Coblentz's death, Betty Watters of Independence, Mo., wrote, ''Your letters remind me of my mother -- her chickens, gardens, canning, cleaning, working every day in fields by Dad's side and clean-smelling laundry whipping and snapping in the fresh air and sunshine.''

         Aileen Riggin Soule, a diver and swimmer who at age 14 became the youngest American Olympic gold medalist and later became the oldest living American female gold medalist, died Thursday in a nursing home in Honolulu. She was 96.         At the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, Riggin won the first gold medal awarded in women's springboard diving and became, at 4 feet 7 inches and 65 pounds, the smallest American Olympic champion. In the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, she became the only woman to win medals in swimming and diving in the same Olympics, taking the silver medal in springboard diving and the bronze medal in the 100-meter backstroke.         In 1974, in one of the many articles she wrote on her career, she said:         ''My most unforgettable experience would have to be as the youngest member of the first American women's Olympic swimming and diving team in 1920. I was a very small 14-year-old. Until two months before the tryouts, we had no idea of the dives required, and some were entirely new. Lacking precedent, we learned as we went along, yet practice was uncertain as the boards were not standardized.         ''When the book of rules arrived, it was in French and sent us to the dictionary to discover what a 'coup de pied à la lune' was. It turned out to be a gainer [a dive now known as a reverse]. There were also 12 dives instead of the usual 10, two of which to be drawn from a hat just before the contest.''         Last-minute preparation was the story of her career. She was born May 2, 1906, in Newport, R.I., and reared in New York City. Her father was a Navy paymaster, and she traveled extensively with her parents.         She learned to swim at age 6, in Manila Bay. In 1918, she came down with influenza during the epidemic that swept the United States during World War I. On her doctor's recommendation that she swim for her health, she joined the celebrated Women's Swimming Association team in New York.         In 1919, when she took up diving, there were no indoor pools with diving boards available to women. Many people thought women should not dive at all because it would injure their health.         The only place to practice in the metropolitan New York area was a tidal pool on Long Island, an hour from the city. When the tide rose, the board was about 10 feet above the surface, about the height of a 3-meter springboard. When the tide was out, the drop was 14 feet, so the divers tried to time their practices for high tide in warm weather on weekends.         Even with those poor training conditions, Riggin finished second in the United States Olympic trials behind Helen Wainwright, who was also 14. But until the day before the boat sailed for Antwerp, they were not sure they would be able to compete in the Olympics because many officials did not want women, much less two 14-year-olds. But because Riggin and Wainwright had also made the Olympic team as swimmers, they went.         For 13 days, they sailed on a battered military transport ship, where training was a nightmare. Riggin recalled: ''I remember the javelin throwers could tie a rope around their javelin, throw them out to sea and pull them back. The shooters used clay pigeons until they ran out. After a while, the sea gulls were looking pretty good.''         In a tiny canvas tank filled with seawater, the swimmers, one at a time, swam 5 to 10 minutes, held in place by a belt around the waist. Divers could not train at all.''         In Antwerp, a city still recovering from World War I, the swimmers and divers competed in a moat-like canal. Ethelda Bleibtrey, the American who won gold medals in all three women's races, told King Albert I of Belgium, ''I swam in mud, not water.''         The diving board was a plank with no spring, and, Riggin said, ''the water was black and icy cold.'' Without a coach there, the American women swept the medals, with Wainwright winning the silver and Thelma Payne the bronze. After that, American women won every gold medal in Olympic springboard diving until 1960.         In 1924, Riggin was an Olympian again, joining American teammates like Johnny Weissmuller, who later gained fame playing Tarzan, and a Yale rower named Benjamin Spock.         ''Being 18 and being in Paris was wonderful,'' she said. ''The sun was shining, we read Hemingway and we were just carried away.''         She was in the first underwater swimming film in 1922 and the first slow-motion swimming and diving films in 1923. She turned professional in 1925, giving diving exhibitions and swimming demonstrations in England and Wales.         In 1926, she played three weeks at the Hippodrome in New York, diving into a glass tank, into six feet of water. After her former swimming teammate Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel, Riggin and Ederle toured for six months. In 1937, at the Cleveland Exposition, Riggin helped organize and star in the first Billy Rose Aquacade.         She toured the world, appeared in movies and wrote a sports column for The New York Evening Post and articles for national magazines. In 1967, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. She never stopped swimming or lecturing or writing about it, and at 85 she broke six world records for her age group in the world masters championships.         She and her husband, Howard Soule, who died several years ago, moved to Hawaii in 1957 and lived in a Diamond Head apartment in Honolulu. Even into her 90's, she swam three miles a week in the ocean.         She is survived by a daughter, Yvonne May of Zurich; a stepdaughter, Patti Anderson of Honolulu; and two stepsons, Bruce Soule of Newport Beach, Calif., and Wallace Soule of Bakersfield, Calif.         In 1996, when asked if she had any goals in addition to attending the Atlanta Olympics, she replied: ''Yes. I'd like to continue -- life in general, that is.''       
         Kim Gallagher, a slim but strong runner who overcame endless illnesses to win a silver medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and a bronze in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, died Monday in a Philadelphia hospital. She was 38 and lived in Oreland, Pa.         The cause of death was a stroke, her husband, John Corcoran, said. She learned she had colon cancer after the 1988 Olympics and stomach cancer in 1995. In remission from colon cancer, she resumed running and last competed in the 1992 United States Olympic trials.         Both Olympic medals came at 800 meters, and Gallagher was the only American woman or man to win an individual track medal in Seoul at a distance longer than 400 meters. Her 1988 Olympic time of 1 minute 56.91 seconds still ranks as the third fastest by an American woman at 800 meters, behind Jearl Miles-Clark (1:56.40) and Mary Decker Slaney (1:56.90).         Her athletic success was remarkable considering her health. Six months before the 1984 Olympics, she had surgery for multiple cysts on her ovaries caused by an estrogen imbalance. The condition reappeared until it was finally relieved by hormone treatment.         Years later, when colon cancer was diagnosed, Gallagher rejected her doctor's recommendation of surgery and chemotherapy, treating it with vitamins, diet and rest. The cancer went into remission, then reappeared in 1994.         A year later, she said: ''I'm fine, I'm healthy, I'm strong. But I really can't work a full day. I get tired.''         In 1996, she used a wheelchair, but she refused to see doctors and improved enough to walk with a cane.         Kimberly Ann Gallagher was born June 11, 1964, in Fort Washington, Pa., near Philadelphia. Her track career started at age 7 when she followed her 9-year-old brother, Bart, to his track club.         ''He told me I couldn't join the club and not to hang around him,'' she once said. ''I remember I was wearing clogs, and I knew that I was ready to do track, whatever that was.         ''When I won my first trophy and it was as big as me, I knew I wanted to someday make the Olympic team.''         At 8, she ran a 5:37 mile, the fastest by a girl that age. At 16, she finished eighth in the 800 meters in the Olympic trials.         Gallagher attended the University of Arizona for a semester and a half, training with the men's cross-country team. She left college, she said, because ''world-class training and competing for a college don't go hand in hand.''         Until college, she had been coached by her brother, Bart, who died in 2000. When she left college, he looked for an experienced coach for her and chose Chuck DeBus in California. DeBus coached her from 1983 to 1988, but he said her health prevented her from completing half her workouts. ''Who knows how fast she could have run if she could have trained like a normal person?'' he told The Los Angeles Times.         DeBus was later barred for two years by The Athletics Congress, then the sport's national governing body, for supplying anabolic steroids to his athletes.         After Gallagher started training with DeBus, her 5-foot-5 body became muscular, although her weight seldom exceeded 108 pounds. She said she never took steroids.         ''I never wanted to look like all those pumped-up, big-looking, talking-weird women,'' she said. ''I liked my looks too much.''         Gallagher insisted she never loved the sport. She liked what it brought, especially a Mercedes-Benz and a Malibu home after her 1984 Olympic success.         She is survived by her husband; her 13-year-old daughter, Jessica Smith; her mother, Barbara of Philadelphia; and her father, John of Benson, Ariz.         She summed up her career by saying: ''I needed to run for all the wrong reasons. I needed to run to keep my shoe contract. I needed to run to pay my bills. I learned a huge lesson. When I ran in the 1984 Olympics, I was going to be a star. I was going to make so much money, and I did.         ''But it doesn't last if you're not devoted to what you're doing. I was not devoted to my running, and it showed. I don't get a great joy from running or training or going out and doing all the work. Running is not something I love, but I like excelling at things that I am good at.''
