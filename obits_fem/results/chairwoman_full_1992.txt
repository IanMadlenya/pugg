         Evelyn Lord Smithson, a professor of classics and a noted archeologist who studied Greece in the Homeric age, died on Monday at her home in Amherst, N.Y. She was 68 years old.         She died of cancer, according to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where she was on the faculty.         For more than 40 years Dr. Smithson traveled each summer to work on the excavations of the ancient agora, or marketplace, in Athens that were supervised by the American School of Classical Studies there.         The Greek period that she studied, from 1200 to 900 B.C., is challenging because of its lack of a literary record. She focused on pottery and its decorations for insights into the culture.         Dr. Smithson was born in Indiana.  She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1944, a master's degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1946 and a doctorate in classical archeology and Greek from Bryn Mawr in 1956.

         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         May Rudin, philanthropist and matriarch of one of Manhattan's real-estate dynasties, died yesterday at her East Side home. She was 95 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         A native of New York City, she was one of seven children born to immigrant parents. May Cohen dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and enrolled in a business school to study typing, stenography, bookkeeping and commercial law. She then went to work as a bookkeeper.         In 1923, she married Samuel Rudin, who four years later founded Rudin Management, realtors and builders, whose holdings now comprise dozens of tall buildings. The buildings, assembled over 60 years, were valued at $1.5 billion by analysts two years ago.         When Mr. Rudin died in 1975, his will established the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, of which Mrs. Rudin was the chairwoman at her death. Well into her 90's, she played an active part in its disbursements, which at last count, in 1990, came to 222 grants totaling $5.3 million. Sponsors of the Marathon         The foundation primarily supported education, social and religious welfare agencies, hospitals and health associations as well as museums and the performing arts. The money was spent mostly in Manhattan, where the Rudins' assets are concentrated.         The Rudins also were the first business sponsors of the New York City Marathon. From its inauguration in 1976 until 1990, May Rudin waited at the finish line each year to present the Samuel Rudin Trophy to the man and woman who broke the tape. Her husband, she noted, was keen on long-distance running well before it became fashionable.         Foundation beneficiaries included St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing, AIDS-related programs, Phoenix House and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center to public-school children, Lincoln Center and New York University, where the foundation endowed a chair in the humanities.         Mrs. Rudin is survived by her sons Jack and Lewis, respectively the chairman and the president of the family business, both residents of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on July 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan. Studied Greek Jewish Group         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan.         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Marian A. Granowitz, a former vice chairwoman of the Republican State and Westchester County Committees, died on Thursday at Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 78 years old and a lifelong resident of Port Chester, N.Y.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         Mrs. Granowitz's unpaid party work was a labor of love. Moving steadily up the ladder of leadership in the Westchester organization in the 1970's and 1980's, she served as its vice chairwoman, then regional vice chairwoman to coordinate Republican activities in five counties. She finally became a state vice chairwoman.         Born in Port Chester, she graduated from public high school and went to work for B. Altman's White Plains store. She headed its cosmetics department but quit to raise her children.         Her husband, Irving M. Granowitz, a certified public accountant, died in 1975.         Mrs. Granowitz is survived by two daughters, Ida Granowitz of Manhattan, and Tina Marks of Hartsdale, N.Y.; a son, Philip of Stanford, Conn.; a brother, Milton Smith of Port Chester, and three grandchildren.       
         Harriet W. Sheridan, former undergraduate dean at Brown University, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 67 years old and lived in Barrington, R.I.         The cause of death was cancer, said Don DeMaio, a Brown spokesman.         Professor Sheridan was hired as dean at Brown in 1979 and remained in the post until 1987, when she resigned to return to her longtime career, the teaching of English. She later founded the Center for the Advancement of College Teaching at the university and was noted for her course on literature and medicine, which proved popular with many medical students.         She had arrived at Brown from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she had spent 26 years and had served at various times as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, chairwoman of the English department and faculty chairwoman. She was also Carleton's acting president from January to August of 1977, succeeding Howard Swearer, who had resigned to become president at Brown.         A native of Manhattan, she received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from Smith College in 1945 and a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1950.         Professor Sheridan was chairwoman of the American Association for Higher Education and a member of many educational groups, including the American Council on Education's Commission on Women in Higher Education. She was a former director of the Association of American Colleges and a former member of the Commission on Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.         She is survived by her husband, Philip; two daughters, Alison Buffum of Narrangansett, R.I., and Roo Sheridan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
         Amelia Lobsenz, a public-relations executive who ran her own firm in Manhattan for the last 36 years, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in Old Brookville, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Kay Abrahams.         A native of Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Lobsenz graduated from Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., and became one of the first women to rise into the executive ranks of her profession.         She formed Lobsenz Public Relations in 1956; it became Lobsenz-Stevens Inc. in 1975. At the time of her death she was board chairwoman and chief executive of the firm, which counts American Home Products, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Procter & Gamble among its clients.         Besides her daughter, a Manhattan resident, Ms. Lobsenz is survived by her husband, Dr. Harry Abrahams; a son, Michael Lobsenz of Boyds, Md., and three grandchildren.       
         Anne G. Wilder, who led the expansion of Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit developmental theater in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wilder joined the Playwrights Horizons board in 1976 and was its chairwoman for the last 11 years. She helped raise money and guide the purchase of its building at 416 West 42d Street, which houses two theaters and administrative offices.         The organization sponsored many productions, some of which moved to Off Broadway, including Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," Jonathan Reynolds's "Geniuses" and Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic."         Among the writers, composers and lyricists supported by Playwrights Horizons have been Ted Tally, A. R. Gurney, Alfred Uhry, James Lapine, William Finn and Albert Innaurato.         Mrs. Wilder also produced two Off Broadway shows that received critical and popular note: "A . . . My Name Is Alice," a musical revue, and a trilogy of one-act plays, "Win/Lose/Draw."         Before her involvement in the theater, Mrs. Wilder was a volunteer, lecturer, trainer and board member of the New York City School Volunteer program.         She was born in Bayonne, N.J., and grew up in Englewood, N.J. She graduated from Connecticut College in 1950.         She is survived by her husband, Robert C. Wilder; a daughter, Rachel W. Smeragliuolo of Baltimore; two sons, Clinton D., of San Francisco, and Robert D., of Washington; a sister, Doris Gould of Atlanta, and a granddaughter.       
         Ann F. Friedlaender, an economist who was the first woman to become an academic dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 54 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.         She died of cancer, said Charles Ball, an M.I.T. spokesman.         Professor Friedlaender, who held a joint professorship in economics and civil engineering, was dean of M.I.T.'s School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1984 to 1990. In 1983 she was named chairwoman of the economics department.         She was also a director of the Rand Corporation and of Conrail.         Professor Friedlaender is survived by her husband, Stephen Friedlaender; two sons, Lucas Friedlaender and Nathaniel Friedlaender, both of Newton, and a brother, Alexander L. Fetter, of Palo Alto, Calif.       
         Elinor Kridel Bernheim, a social-welfare volunteer whose widely cast interests ranged from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and Columbia University's School of Social Work to a community center she founded in the Bronx, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 85 years old.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Bernheim relentlessly made the rounds of board rooms, foundation offices and charity luncheons and dinners, starting in the 1940's. In 1975, she still sat on the boards of 11 charities. At the time, The New York Times's About New York column described her as "The Queen of Volunteers," who was "the champion volunteer worker in town."         "I love this kind of work," she said between meetings with people who held the purse strings to grants for worthy causes. Sometimes it kept her busy for 15 hours a day, she said.         "You know why we do it?" she asked. "Because it shows we're alive. So many of the younger women now want to get paid. It's a status thing with them."         "I'll tell you what I'm good at," she declared. "I'm good at finding people for boards because I know a lot of people. I'm good at organizing, fund-raising and whipping up enthusiasm.         "I don't fight with anyone unless I have to get things done -- and then I'm a dog, very mean." She also was a critic of professional social-work jargon that she said could scare otherwise interested laypeople off.         Mrs. Bernheim, whose late husband, Leonard, was a stockbroker, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1985. She recovered enough to return to the causes closest to her heart -- in a wheelchair or by telephone -- until her death.         Among those lasting interests were the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, which she began in the 1950's and presided over until 1970. It was innovative because it was affiliated with a hospital, Montefiore Medical Center. Others included the New York chapter of the National Council on Alcoholism and Young Concert Artists, which helps talented young people to start a career.         Also remaining dear to her heart was the New York School of Social Work at Columbia, a place where she did postgraduate work after her 40th birthday, in the 1947-48 academic year. She later served as a member of its advisory board and took special pride when Columbia awarded her its Bicentennial Medal in 1956. It was but one of many honors bestowed on her.         Mrs. Bernheim was born Elinor Kridel in New York City on June 26, 1907, and graduated from Vassar College in 1928. By 1941, she was a member of the board and the council of the Association for Aid for Crippled Children.         Her relationship with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies went back to her years as a young woman. She became a trustee in 1942 and two years later was co-host of a luncheon addressed by Eleanor Roosevelt.         She served as chairwoman of the women's division fund campaigns in 1943, 1944 and 1949. After that, she became a vice president of the federation and board chairwoman of the women's division.         Over the decades, Mrs. Bernheim also was an officer or otherwise involved in, among others, the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Conference for Social Welfare, an advisory committee on volunteer services for the Veterans Administration, the United Neighborhood Houses of New York City, the National Council on Social Work Education and the Associated Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations.         She was also involved with the Community Council of Greater New York, the Community Service Society, the National Homemakers Service Council and the Brookdale Institute on Aging, among others. She was a co-founder of the Florence G. Heller Research Center. She served three terms as vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York and was elected its first president in 1973.         Mrs. Bernheim's husband died in 1980. She is survived by two sons, Leonard H. Jr. and Charles A., both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.       
         Fairy D. McIntire, a religious leader and the wife of Dr. Carl McIntire, president of the International Council of Churches, died on Sept. 13 at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 85 years old and lived in Collingswood, N.J.         She died of cancer, said a daughter, Celeste M. Bashaw of Princeton, N.J.         Mrs. McIntire was deeply involved in the work of Mr. McIntire's church, the Bible Presbyterian Church, in Collingswood, and in the international council, an organization of more than 500 fundamentalist churches.         She was president of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Faith Theological Seminary in Elkins Park, Pa., and chairwoman of the auxiliary to the Christian Admiral Bible Conference and Freedom Center in Cape May, N.J.         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a son, Carl T., of Toronto; another daughter, Marianna M. Clark, of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a sister, Oleta McCarty, of Pensacola, Fla.; 13 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Hadassah, a pioneer of Israeli and Indian dancing in America, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Milton Epstein.         Hadassah, who was born in Jerusalem and whose original name was Hadassah Spira, became interested in Indian dancing at an early age. She studied dance in the United States and abroad, learning a wide range of Indian styles along with Javanese court dance, Japanese dance and modern dance. Her teachers included Ram Gopal and Jack Cole.         Hadassah, a performer of special eloquence, made her professional debut in 1945 and continued to perform Indian, Israeli, Javanese and Balinese dance through the mid-1970's. She appeared at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., four times in the 1950's and 60's and toured India in 1959-60.         Among Hadassah's best-known works was "Shuvi Nafshi" ("Return, Oh My Soul"), based on Psalm 116. Her "Tagore Suite," commissioned by the Tagore Centenary Committee, was performed for the first time in 1961.         Hadassah was also a popular teacher, known for her great warmth, who taught Israeli and Indian dance across the United States and abroad. She was a faculty member, board member and chairwoman of the ethnic division at the New Dance Group Studio in Manhattan and continued teaching through the mid-1980's.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Harriet Silverstein of San Diego, and three brothers, Simon, also of San Diego, Israel, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Abraham, of Yardley, Pa.       
         Elaine Whitelaw, for half a century the chief fund raiser and a major force for the March of Dimes, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Patricia Snyderman of San Francisco.         In 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tapped her to join the national women's committee of the March of Dimes, which he founded to fight polio, Miss Whitelaw recognized the philanthropic potential of middle-income Americans. By creating a network of volunteers and programs for children and mothers, she made them the backbone of one of the country's most successful charities.         A dozen years after it began, the March of Dimes was helping to rid America of polio and has used the network Miss Whitelaw created to continue financing the fight against a variety of birth defects. 'She Was Irresistible'         "She was the general of a volunteer army," said Beverly Sills, the national chairwoman of the March of Dimes and a longtime friend of Miss Whitelaw's.         As a fixture on the national charity-ball scene, Miss Whitelaw embodied can-do do-gooding. Both colleagues and those she tapped relentlessly for contributions said she practiced what she preached. They described her as demanding, innovative, boundlessly energetic and fiercely determined.         "When she approached me about becoming involved with the March of Dimes she said, 'Other charities want to put your name on their stationery. I want your time, your energy and your money,' " Ms. Sills recalled. "She was irresistible."         Roseamond Elaine Whitelaw was born on Nov. 21, 1914, the oldest child of Louis Whitelaw, a wealthy diamond merchant, and his wife, Dora. Along with two younger brothers, Seymour and Jordan, Miss Whitelaw grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College, where she studied American history and art. She returned and embarked on a lifelong mission of balancing society and its entitlements and the social obligations of Roosevelt's New Deal.         "There was no question that I was going to work," she said last year. "But of course I wasn't going to work at some perfume counter and take a job from someone who needed it." After a brief stint as a script reader, an early marriage that ended in divorce and the birth of her daughter, Patricia, she volunteered to raise money for the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. She moved on to volunteer for the National War Fund.         She later married Otto Brodnitz, an economist and stockbroker, and the couple lived on the Upper East side of Manhattan until his death in the mid-1970's.         After joining the March of Dimes in 1943, Miss Whitelaw created a network of volunteers who sought donations in cinemas and door to door. She also used her prodigious organizational abilities to help orchestrate the field tests of the Salk polio vaccine. "Her influence was all pervasive,' said Dr. Jonas Salk, founder of the Salk Institute in San Diego, Calif.  Serving Hot Meals         Later, along with Eleanor Lambert, she organized a fashion show to benefit the March of Dimes that Time magazine called "the event of the year." In 1976, she began "Gourmet Galas," dinners prepared in various cities by local celebrities and judged by culinary experts. Today, there are 40 different galas across the United States.         After retiring from the March of Dimes last year, Miss Whitelaw volunteered as a regional director of the Enterprise Foundation, a national organization involved in housing the poor. Increasingly concerned with homelessness, drug use and AIDS, she spent nights last winter riding a Planned Parenthood van and counseling women who lived or worked on the streets in the Bronx.         "The only way we're going to get them in for treatment is to feed them," she told a reporter at the time. "They don't know they might be sick. They know they're hungry, their children are hungry." Within days, she had cooking equipment and food donations, and, in her Adolfo suits and Ferragamo shoes, she helped serve hot meals from midnight to dawn.         One of the young women she fed, a runaway, took words from Miss Whitelaw's vocabulary to describe her. "She's a great dame," she said.         Miss Whitelaw is survived by her daughter; her brother, Seymour Whitelaw of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Sybil Claiborne, a novelist and short story writer, died Wednesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Hospital. She was 69.         She died of lung cancer, said Grace Paley, the writer, who was a friend.         Ms. Claiborne was active in the antiwar movement and frequently wrote in opposition to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. She was a board member of the War Resister's League for many years.         Ms. Claiborne was in her 50's when her first stories began to appear in magazines like The New Yorker and Esquire. Some of her writing was the basis for a program of comedy-dramas performed in Manhattan in 1978 at Symphony Space.         Her book "Loose Connections," a collection of short stories, was published by Academy Chicago in 1988, and a novel, "A Craving for Women," was published by Dutton in 1989.         Last year she completed "In the Garden of Dead Cars," which is to be published by Cleis in the spring. It is a work of fiction that again reflects her abhorrence of war and tyranny, Ms. Paley said.         At her death, Ms. Claiborne was chairwoman of the Women's Committee of PEN, the writers' organization. She was also a member of the National Writers' Union, of which her husband, Robert Claiborne, was an organizer and founder. He died last year. Her only son, Jan Stacey, died in 1990.         She is survived by a stepdaughter, Amanda Claiborne Shulman of Cambridge, Mass.; a stepson, Sam Claiborne of Brooklyn; a grandson, Matthew Shulman, and a brother, David Resnik of Stockbridge, Mass.         Correction:  December 20, 1992, Sunday         The headline on the obituary of a writer and antiwar campaigner yesterday rendered her last name incorrectly in some copies. She was Sybil Claiborne.
