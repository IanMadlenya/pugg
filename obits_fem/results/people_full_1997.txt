         Katharine Homer Fryer, an artist, teacher and writer who devoted much of her later life to the mentally disturbed, died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 89 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         At her death, she was president of the Schizophrenia Foundation of New York, which provides information on alternative treatments for the illness. She headed the foundation since 1969, shortly after its creation.         She also was director emeritus of the Fryer Research Center, an outpatient clinic in the former Murray Hill Hospital on East 40th Street in Manhattan. It offers a biochemical-nutritional approach to emotional and mental conditions, like schizophrenia and depression, as well as physical disorders.         She founded the nonprofit center in 1971 to help people who could not otherwise afford such treatment, and remained its director until a few months ago. Her daughter and successor, Dr. Kathy Fryer, estimated yesterday that the center had served more than 10,000 people and their families.         Mrs. Fryer's dedication stemmed in large part from living with mental illness in her immediate family. One of her five daughters, Barbara, committed suicide in 1968 at age 31, after spending 10 years in a succession of treatments for schizophrenia.         In a new book, ''The Story of Barbara,'' Mrs. Fryer wrote of her daughter's condition, which might have had a different outcome with the alternative treatments for schizophrenia emerging then. The book is to be published by Rivercross Publishing later this year.         An earlier book was ''Kathy: A Mother's True Story of a Young Girl's Fight to Regain Health'' (Dutton, 1956). It told of her daughter Kathy's successful emergence from a mysterious ailment that befell her at 13 and a mother's years of searching for the right diagnosis and cure.         Mrs. Fryer wrote of the ''unexpected, miraculous'' deliverance when Kathy's condition was recognized and swiftly overcome. It proved to be a complex case of severe thyroid deficiency aggravated by psychological problems.         Mrs. Fryer published a second book in 1994, ''Till Death Do Us Part,'' on life with her husband, Dr. Douglas Fryer, a pioneer in industrial psychology and a prolific author, whom she married in 1934. A former head of the Department of Psychology at New York University, he died in 1960.         Katharine Homer was born in New York City to two well-known parents, Sidney Homer, a composer of chamber music and songs, and Louise Homer, a Metropolitan Opera contralto. In the 1920's, she studied piano, singing and painting under distinguished teachers at the Curtis Institute of Music, Mannes College of Music and the Arts League in New York, and at l'Ecole Julienne in Paris.         For several years, she traveled as her mother's accompanist before touring on her own as a solo pianist and with chamber music groups. She exhibited her paintings in New York and Paris.         In 1932, she organized a 50-member girls' choir in Scarsdale, N.Y., and directed it until 1951. She also organized and directed an adult choir in Rye, N.Y., in the 1960's.         All along, until her work at the foundation and center became a primary occupation, she privately taught piano, singing and painting. She also served stints as a piano teacher at the Manhattan School of Music in the 1930's, and more recently at the Brearley School.         Besides Dr. Fryer, a Manhattan resident, she is survived by three other daughters, Dr. Judith Shedden, Anne Eddis and Dr. Sarah Leibowitz, all of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Elspeth Huxley, a witty and energetic journalist and author of more than 30 books, including memoirs, biographies, crime stories and novels, many inspired by her childhood in colonial Kenya, died on Jan. 10 in a nursing home in Tetbury, in Gloucestershire, England, a family friend said. She was 89.         Although her eclectic literary output reflected an extraordinary range of interests, Mrs. Huxley was perhaps best known for a 1959 work of autobiographical fiction, ''The Flame Trees of Thika,'' which was based on her early life among white settlers on her father's coffee plantation. Although some Kenyans denounced it as an apologia for colonial rule, the book was widely praised for its rich sense of humor, its affectionate personal portraits and its gentle evocation of life in a singular place. ''The Flame Trees of Thika'' became an immensely popular best seller, and in 1981 was made into a television series in Britain. The next year  it was shown on public television in the United States.         Elspeth Josceline Huxley was born in July 1907, the only child of Maj. Josceline Grant, a Scot, and his formidable wife, the former Nellie Grosvenor. Her father, whose failed business schemes included a plan to develop a new kind of motorcar, was a ''gentle, humorous, dreamy person whose dreams never came true,'' she once said. Her mother was a daughter of Lord Stalbridge, who, despite being the younger brother of the first Duke of Westminster, had little money.         In any case, no money came to the family. When she was 5, her family  moved to Kenya, taking possession of a 500-acre coffee farm that Major Grant had bought on a whim in the bar of a Nairobi hotel. They arrived on an ox cart, worked full time on the plantation and had major swings in financial fortune; when they ran out of money for gas, for instance, they had to use oxen to pull the farm truck.         For her part, she was sometimes taught at home and sometimes in school. She had little choice, she later remembered, but ''to fall back on old copies of the Field, manuals of instruction on everything from lace-making to the erection of simple stills, and the volumes of a pocket encyclopedia in minute type.'' At one point she was sent to school in England, but the school sent her home in 1919 after it discovered that she was running numbers on the Derby horse race.         While still a teen-ager, she discovered that she could use her writing talent to make money. Her first published article, in a magazine called The Magician Monthly, was about a magic trick of her own invention. Later, under the pseudonym Bamboo, she wrote a polo column for The East African Monthly, answering readers' questions despite her ignorance about the game. By the time she was 17, she had had 65 articles published in Kenyan newspapers, some of them illustrated with her own photographs.         In 1925, she went to England, earning an agriculture degree from Reading University. Thanks to a wealthy uncle, she also studied agriculture at Cornell University in the United States. Her interest in farming remained throughout her life, and in 1960 she published ''Brave New Victuals: An Inquiry Into Modern Farm Production,'' in which she questioned the increasing reliance on artificial farming methods.         Major Grant and his wife, now the owners of a pig and maize farm, had hoped that their daughter would eventually return to Kenya. But attracted to journalism, she wrote dozens of articles for British magazines and newspapers and took a job for $:5 a week as a press officer at the Empire Marketing Board in England. The job evaporated during the Depression, but in 1931, she married her boss, Gervas Huxley, chief of the publicity department.         She soon had an opportunity to indulge her love of travel: Huxley, a grandson of the humanist Thomas Henry Huxley and a cousin of Aldous, the author, was appointed head of the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board, a job that required him to travel around the world, encouraging people to drink tea.         In 1935, Mrs. Huxley published her first book, a biography of Lord Delamere, a white settler who revolutionized large-scale farming in Kenya. The book, ''White Man's Country: Lord Delamere and the Making of Kenya,'' was widely regarded as an authoritative account of colonial eastern Africa. More books followed at a rapid pace, including three detective novels and ''Red Strangers'' (1939), a novel that told the story of white settlement from the view of several generations of native Kenyans.         During World War II, the Huxleys returned to England, settling on a pig and dairy farm in the Wiltshire countryside, where they remained the rest of their lives. Mrs. Huxley worked for a time for the BBC's propaganda department, and in 1948  helped to establish the East African Literature Bureau, which worked to publish books by Africans.         In 1959 her ''Flame Trees of Thika'' appeared, followed in 1962 by a sequel, ''On the Edge of the Rift.'' Mrs. Huxley returned to the same themes in 1988 with a memoir, ''Out in the Midday Sun: My Kenya.'' In a review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote, ''It makes us appreciate the peculiar mixture of courage, rashness, perseverance, idealism and opportunism that brought such a varied group of people to this beautiful, dangerous land.''         Mrs. Huxley was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1962. Her husband died in 1971; she is survived by their son, Charles, and  three grandsons.         Mrs. Huxley attributed much of her energy, sense of humor and intelligence to her mother, who had, among other things, compiled a Swahili-English dictionary that was published by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. (The dictionary was less than comprehensive and,  Mrs. Huxley later said, ''It contained not very useful phrases like 'The idle slaves are scratching themselves' ''). In 1980, she published a collection of her mother's letters along with a biographical essay, in ''Nellie: Letters From Africa.''         As the African nationalist movement gathered steam, Mrs. Huxley wrote a number of articles defending white settlers and colonial rule. She later wrote with lucid sympathy about the challenges facing the newly independent nations under majority rule.         Among Mrs. Huxley's other books  are a country diary about life in Wiltshire and biographies of Florence Nightingale and the Antarctic explorer Robert Scott. Her last book, a biography of Scott's son, the naturalist Peter Scott, was written when she was 83. Energetic to the end, she last visited Africa in 1995, gardened enthusiastically, took an hourlong walk every day and corresponded with a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.         She also took on myriad causes, protesting the erosion of the countryside and the disappearance of rural post offices, for instance, while espousing euthanasia and the protection of rhinoceroses. But in her last Who's Who entry, she described her recreations as ''resting and gossip.''       
         Marie Collins McGuire Thompson, who worked to improve the design of public housing for the elderly and low-income people as the Public Housing Administrator in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died last Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mrs. Thompson was 92 and lived in Kensington, Md.         Marie McGuire, as she was known, came to public housing with an aversion to ''bare, stark shelter'' that, she said, ''has brought no happiness to us.'' Instead, she espoused programs to create homes of which their occupants could be proud. Her advocacy drew criticism from legislators and defenders of traditional approaches, but architectural organizations backed her. Housing projects begun under her leadership won unaccustomed design awards.         She came to national attention as executive director of the San Antonio Housing Authority, where she championed amenities like balconies for every apartment. Studying the special needs of the elderly with limited means, she insisted on features like weatherproof ramps, handrails in all rooms and corridors and emergency bells in the bathrooms.         Her crowning achievement was the Golden Age Center, with 185 low-rent apartments designed for the elderly, that opened in 1960 in San Antonio. The next year, President John F. Kennedy recruited her as the first woman to become Public Housing Administrator. She held the post until 1966, when her office was merged into the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. There she became special assistant to the Secretary, working on housing and problems that affect the disabled and the elderly.         She left the Government in 1972. Until 1982, she was the housing specialist at the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, now the Center for Social Gerontology in Ann Arbor, Mich.         Mrs. Thompson was born in the Georgetown area of Washington. She studied journalism at George Washington University and, years later, studied architecture and real estate management at the University of Houston.         She wrote four books, ''Housing for the Elderly'' (1957), ''Housing and the Disabled'' (1976), ''Housing for the Handicapped'' (1977) and ''Housing for Rural Elderly'' (1982).         Her first marriage, to John McGuire, a Government geologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Thomas B. Thompson of San Antonio, an architect, died in 1983. She is survived by a sister, Margaret C. Schweinhaut, also of Kensington.       
         Mary Bancroft, a Boston Brahmin colleen who cut a coquettish swath through 20th-century history, bewitching men of power even as she did brilliant work as an American spy in Switzerland in World War II, died on Jan. 10 at her Fifth Avenue apartment. She was 93.         If Mary Bancroft had not existed, a hack novelist would surely have invented her, or tried.         Dime store fiction could undoubtedly have accommodated her cliche origins as the daughter of a patrician, Harvard-trained lawyer and a distinctly declasse Irish girl, who died in childbirth, setting up her father's marriage to a disapproving, if not quite wicked, stepmother.         He left his daughter to be reared by a paternal grandmother with such a haughty and virulent disdain for the Irish that it was years before Miss Bancroft learned that the woman had herself been an Irish working girl before marrying into the august Bancroft family.         It would have taken a Dickens to invent Nolan, the Bancroft coachman who became Miss Bancroft's constant childhood companion, sharing her delight in the day's news, especially of war and disaster.         And a Dickens could even have contrived for her father's second wife to be the stepdaughter of Clarence Barron, the short, rotund powerhouse owner of The Wall Street Journal who encouraged his step-granddaughter to meet and study people of all walks of life, ''even gamblers and crooks,'' and who gave her what became her credo as a sometime journalist and spy: ''Facts are not the truth but only indicate where the truth may lie.''         A novelist might have foreseen that a daring, restless woman would find Smith College such a bore that she would escape after a year into what turned out to be a stultifying marriage to a teen-age chum and then divorce and seek refuge in another loveless marriage, this time to a Swiss businessman.         But it would have taken a remarkable visionary to have imagined Miss Bancroft's later life as an accomplished spy, a woman with such penetrating intelligence, infallible intuition and boundless verve -- not to mention legs that rarely failed to draw a second glance -- that her intellectual, emotional or romantic conquests included Carl Jung, Woody Allen and Henry R. Luce.         To Jung, the psychologist who became her confidant during her years in Switzerland, her appeal was textbook obvious. In his scheme of things she was an extroverted intuitive, one who had experienced such fierce inter-family battles for her affections as a child that power had become her natural element. She had such an instinctive knack for wielding it, he told her, that men seeking or holding power would cherish her advice, as indeed they did.         Her relationships were often platonic, apparently -- and surprisingly -- including even her postwar fling in New York with Luce, the Time Inc. founder and a legendary ladies' man.         But as her own 1983 book, ''Autobiography of a Spy,'' makes explicit, her wartime romance with Allen Dulles, the American spymaster who laid the groundwork for the Central Intelligence Agency with his brilliant successes in Switzerland in World War II, was as torrid as they come.         At the time, Miss Bancroft's second marriage was beginning to unravel, and Mr. Dulles, whose wife was in the United States, was looking for recruits to interview the hundreds of refugees, adventurers and spies who poured into officially neutral Switzerland from every corner of wartime Europe.         Impressed with the insightful analyses of German articles and speeches she had prepared for one of his associates, he sought her out, quickly concluding that she would be an ideal operative, and more.         ''It should work out very well,'' he blurted out on their second meeting. ''We can let the work cover the romance -- and the romance cover the work.'' The remark might have seemed startling considering that the subject of romance had not been mentioned, but Mr. Dulles was as perceptive as his recruit. The logic appealed to her, and so did he.         In what became a regular routine, she would help him prepare his legendary nightly telephone reports to Washington at his home in Bern, and then the two would engage in what she called ''a bit of dalliance.''         As a spy, she interviewed and sized up visitors from Germany and German-occupied territory, sometimes with startling results. One contact  provided the first inkling that a previously unknown figure named Joseph Broz had become the man to deal with in Yugoslavia, where he was known as Tito.         When her German maid's brother-in-law wrote from the Russian front asking for an aluminum spoon, noting that his wife had told him none was available in Germany, she picked up a critical clue about the war's effects on German production.         By far her most important work was with Hans Bernd Gisevius, a top officer of German military intelligence, who was not only a key figure in a vast plot to kill Hitler and set up a civilian democracy but who, well in advance of what turned out to be a bungled assassination attempt on July 20, 1944, had supplied a manuscript detailing the conspiracy.         Miss Bancroft was entrusted with translating the manuscript into English (Gisevius wanted it published immediately after the coup), but her real job was to make sure he was not a double agent (she concluded he was not) and then to elicit and pass on the detailed information he supplied about the day-to-day shifts of power and strategy within the German Government.         After the war, her daughter said, Miss Bancroft settled in New York, wrote a few novels, lectured on Jung, became active in local Democratic politics, became friends with Woody Allen and became Luce's confidant.         When her daughter, Mary Jane, married Horace Taft, the son of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the wedding pictures were published in Life, -- ''a present from Luce,'' Mrs. Taft said.         In addition to her daughter, of Atlanta, Miss Bancroft is survived by 6 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, died on Monday night at a nursing home in Southampton, England. She was 100.         Karen Kamuda, the vice president of the Titanic Historical Society, said  in a telephone interview today from Indian Orchard, Mass., that Mrs. Haisman's death left 7 of the 705 survivors still living, 3 in the United States and 2 each in Britain and France.         Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.         She was a guest of honor last August on a pilgrimage cruise to the spot 400 miles off the Newfoundland coast where the liner, on its maiden voyage, hit an iceberg on the night of  April 14-15, 1912.         In 1995 she took part in the opening of a memorial garden at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, with a granite monument commemorating the victims, and in 1993 she appeared in public in Southampton to receive a gold watch thought to be her father's from the head of the American company that had salvaged it from the wreckage.         She had last seen the watch protruding from the waistcoat pocket of her father, Thomas William Solomon Brown, 60, a hotel owner from Worcester, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. He was taking his wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter Edith to Seattle, where he intended to open a new hotel. In the hold of the cruise liner were tableware, furnishings and 1,000 rolls of bed linen for the new enterprise.         In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography, ''A Lifetime on the Titanic,'' published in 1995, Mrs. Haisman gave a vivid account of the ship's final moments, although some details have been called into question.         Mrs. Haisman said she remembered that her father was dressed in an Edwardian dinner jacket, stabbing the cold night air with his cigar and sipping from a snifter of brandy on the deck of the listing ship as she and her mother were being winched 70 feet down into a lifeboat.         Mrs. Haisman said that she never forgot the horror of that night and the loss of her father and that even in her later years she suffered nightmares in which she heard the screaming of the drowning victims in the Atlantic. It was 11:40 P.M. when she recalled being jolted in her three-berth stateroom. ''Father appeared a few minutes later,'' she recalled. ''He told us: 'You'd better put on your life jackets and something warm, it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. We've struck an iceberg -- it's nothing much. The steward in the corridor says it's nothing to worry about.' ''         They hurried through the corridors, leaving behind in their haste her mother's jewelry case, 400 gold sovereigns and a roll of bank notes on top of a bunk. ''We waited for ages on the boat deck for someone to tell us what to do. The ship's band was playing ragtime. They played to keep our spirits up. It was so brave of them. Everybody kept saying: 'She's unsinkable. She won't go down.'         ''Father kissed us and saw us into Lifeboat 14. Up to 50 people got in as it swung perilously over the side. One man jumped into the boat dressed as a woman. As we rowed away from the ship, we could still hear the band playing, but now it was hymns.'' She watched the mighty liner go down.  ''We were almost six hours in the lifeboat and during that time we had  no water and nothing to eat. I kept wondering if my father had got off the ship -- that's all I could think of.''         She and her mother were picked up by the Cunard liner Carpathia and taken to New York, where they left on a train trip to Seattle to spend time with an aunt of Mrs. Haisman's, who lived there and had inspired the move to the West Coast. They soon returned to South Africa, where five years later Edith married Fred Haisman, a shipbuilder's engineering draftsman from London.         Married for 60 years, the couple lived in South Africa, Australia and Southampton, where Mr. Haisman worked in the boatyard. They had 10  children.         Ms. Kamuda, of the Titanic Historical Society, said Mrs. Haisman had ''elaborated'' her story over the years, adding details about what her father was wearing, for example.         ''This is not a criticism of Mrs. Haisman,'' Ms. Kamuda said. ''On the contrary it is only to point out how our memories fail us as time passes and numerous outside influences shape our lives.''         Mrs. Haisman did not share the concern of some survivors and many curators and historians over efforts to salvage mementos from the wreck and to raise parts of the ship itself. The 18-carat pocket watch that she said was her father's had been found in a purser's black leather portmanteau during a dive in 1987.         R. M. S. Titanic of Southport, Conn., the company that exhibits artifacts from the ship and that has drawn charges of exploiting the disaster from Ms. Kamuda and others, had the watch attached to a sterling silver plate inscribed with the words, ''What better use for scientific technology than to reunite a father with his child.'' The chairman of the company, George Tulloch, presented it to Mrs. Haisman in Southampton in December 1993.         By her bed in the nursing home stood a photograph of her father in a straw boater, stiff collar and bowtie.         Mrs. Haisman was born on Oct. 27, 1896. She is survived by four sons, two daughters and more than 30 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Roberts, who directed the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan, died on Jan. 17 at Bellevue Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         In her nearly three decades of presenting dance, Ms. Roberts helped shape the careers of many fledgling avant-garde and black choreographers who later became major modern dance artists, among them Kei Takei, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and Bill T. Jones. A small, rotund woman with an earthy sense of humor, Ms. Roberts also served as a patient yet eminently practical ''great mother figure,'' as Alvin Ailey put it, to several generations of modern dancers.         A central tenet of her career as a dance producer was that no one should be excluded from dance because of imperfect bodies or the color of their skin. She also believed that dance ought to be available to everyone, whether through the low-cost classes at Clark Center or affordable concerts. She wanted, she said in a 1986 interview, to ''offer people the opportunity to take chances.''         Born in Boston, Ms. Roberts attended Hunter College in Manhattan, graduating in 1931 with a degree in political science. It was during her college years that Ms. Roberts began to study dance seriously, performing  with Blanche Evan. When her husband, Paul Ziporkis, died in 1953, Ms. Roberts was left with a daughter to bring up alone. She worked as a magazine caption writer, an administrator at the Downtown Community School and as the director of the June Taylor School before moving on to Clark Center in 1970.         A friendship with Donald McKayle, a young choreographer, led to her first experience producing dance when Mr. McKayle asked her for help in putting on a concert at the 92d Street Y. Ms. Roberts continued to present dance regularly at Clark Center, where Alvin Ailey had started his company in the 1960's. The center is also where Wendy Wasserstein had the first staged reading of one of her plays.         From 1975 to 1978, Ms. Roberts produced a summer dance festival in the mall at the City College Graduate Center on West 42d Street. Her dreams of moving Clark Center from small, dingy studios on Eighth Avenue to a new theater and studio complex on the West 42d Street Theater Row in the mid-80's were dashed after the city reneged on promised support. Ms. Roberts rebounded with an ambitious eight-week series at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row in 1986, the year she resigned from Clark Center. ''We're going to be dancing on 42d Street,'' she told a reporter. ''I may cry a lot, but that's what we're going to do.'' The Clark Center closed in 1988.         Ms. Roberts was a Capezio Award honoree in 1991 and won a Bessie Award in 1986.         She is survived by a daughter, Karen deFrancis of Brooklyn, and a stepsister, Grace Herman of Manhattan.       
         Casey Miller, a writer and editor who was a pioneering advocate of nonsexist language, died on Sunday at her home in East Haddam, Conn. She was 77.         Kate Swift, her close friend and co-author, said the cause of death was chronic obstructive lung disease.         Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift co-wrote numerous books and articles on English usage and its relationship to the status of women. Writing in a climate of increasing sensitivity and opposition to language that relegated women to secondary status, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift waged a forceful campaign against what many considered sexist language. If not all their proposals (like ''genkind'' to replace mankind) found their way into everyday usage, the women nonetheless helped to raise awareness of oppression by language.         Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift were the authors of ''Words and Women,'' published in 1976 by Doubleday and 1991 by HarperCollins, and ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing,'' published in 1980 by Lippincott & Crowell and in 1988 by HarperCollins. They also wrote many articles on sexism in English that appeared in national periodicals and in more than 30 anthologies and textbooks.         They achieved widespread recognition as authorities on the subject of linguistic disparagement of women with ''One Small Step for Genkind,'' a 1972 article in The New York Times Magazine that was reprinted in college textbooks as recently as last year.         In it, they wrote: ''Except for words that refer to females by definition (mother, actress, Congresswoman), and words for occupations traditionally held by females (nurse, secretary, prostitute), the English language defines everyone as male. The hypothetical person (''If a man can walk 10 miles in two hours . . . ), the average person (''the man in the street'') and the active person (''the man on the move'') are male. The assumption is that unless otherwise identified, people in general -- including doctors and beggars -- are men.         ''It is a semantic mechanism that operates to keep women invisible; man and mankind represent everyone; he in generalized use refers to either sex; the ''land where our fathers died'' is also the land of our mothers -- although they go unsung. As the beetle-browed and mustachioed man in a Steig cartoon says to his two male drinking companions, 'When I speak of mankind, one thing I don't mean is womankind.' ''         Ms. Swift said yesterday that the idea for the article grew out of their first collaboration as editors in 1970, on a sex education handbook for high schools that talked about the nature of man and man's behavior and used the pronoun ''he'' in ways that made it impossible to know whether the author was writing about both males and females or only about males.         ''We began to think this was a field that needed to be written about and explored,'' Ms. Swift said.         Their articles on the subject first appeared in New York magazine and in the first issue of Ms. magazine. The New York Times Magazine article appeared on April 16, 1972, and  ''got an awful lot of negative comment,'' Ms. Swift said.         Casey Geddes Miller was born on Feb. 26, 1919, in Toledo, Ohio. She received a bachelor of arts degree in 1940 from Smith College, where she was a philosophy major. During World War II, she served for three years in the Navy, working in Washington in naval intelligence.         She was on the staff of Colonial Williamsburg from 1947 to 1954, when she became the curriculum editor of the publishing house of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press. Ten years later, she became a freelance editor, working at her home in Greenwich and after 1967 in East Haddam, where she formed her editorial partnership with Ms. Swift.         She is survived by her sisters, Kate R. Gregg of Falmouth, Me., and Caroline S. Cooper of Gilmanton, N.H.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Margaret Halsey, author of the 1938 best seller ''With Malice Toward Some,'' which poked fun at English customs and mores, died on Tuesday at the Nathan Miller Nursing Home in White Plains. She was 86.         In her time, Ms. Halsey, a witty writer with an acute social concern, was compared to Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken. She came of age in an era when often the best job a well-educated graduate of a women's college could get was a secretarial position in publishing.         She was born in Yonkers, the daughter of Reinhold Halsey, deputy superintendent of buildings for New York City public schools. She attended Skidmore College.         In 1933, she became secretary to  the author and editor Max Eastman, who got her an entry-level job at Simon & Schuster in Manhattan.         In 1935, she married Henry Simon, an assistant professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia University and the brother of the publisher Richard L. Simon.         The newlyweds went to live in Devon, England, where Mr. Simon was on a teaching exchange. Ms. Halsey's letters home complaining of the eccentricities of English people, their food and the drudgery of their life, caught the attention of her brother-in-law, who commissioned her to write what became ''With Malice Toward Some.''         It included digressions on such subjects as English pie crust: ''It is possible to eat English pie crust, whatever you may think at first. The English eat it, and when they stand up and walk away, they are hardly bent over at all.'' On the subject of English shoes, Ms. Halsey wrote: ''Englishwomen's shoes look as if they had been made by someone who had often heard shoes described but had never seen any.'' The book sold 600,000 copies.         In 1944 Ms. Halsey was divorced from Mr. Simon. That year, she published ''Some of My Best Friends Are Soldiers,'' which she called ''a sort of novel'' about race relations in America. The book, an account of her work at the Stage Door Canteen in Times Square, was the beginning of a lifelong preoccupation with the subject of race.         ''Color Blind: A White Woman Looks at the Negro,'' followed in 1946. In the book, Ms. Halsey wrote that a need for a cheap labor supply and a fear of blacks' sexuality were at the heart of racism. Margaret Mead called the book ''straightforward, courageous and delightful.'' It was banned from schools in Georgia.         In ''The Pseudo-Ethic: A Speculation on American Politics and Morals'' in the late 60's, Ms. Halsey turned her attentions to a defense of Alger Hiss.         During the 1950's and 60's, her life took a darker course, and she wrote about her problems in ''No Laughing Matter: The Autobiography of a WASP'' (1977). She struggled with alcoholism and agoraphobia. Her only child, Deborah, nearly died from a brain tumor, and she was estranged from her parents. In 1969, her second marriage, to Milton R. Stern, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Deborah Halsey Stern, of White Plains.       
         Harriet Pratt Morris, a leader in the movement against the death penalty in Georgia and nationwide, died on Sunday at her home in Atlanta. Mrs. Morris, who was known as Patsy, was 66.         Her husband, the Rev. John B. Morris, said she died of lung cancer.         For some 20 years, first with the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia and after 1987 at the Georgia Appellate Practice and Educational Research Center in Atlanta, Mrs. Morris worked to find legal representation for death row inmates.         She was among the first to document that the likelihood of receiving the death penalty for a murder conviction depended in large part on the race and social status of the victim and the county where the crime took place.         Mrs. Morris's efforts not only earned the gratitude of prisoners spared capital punishment, but also inspired many lawyers to devote their practices to opposing the death penalty. Her work served as a model for those outside the courts as well.         ''Both of us are enormously and extremely opposed to the state killing people,'' Mr. Morris said yesterday. ''We don't believe that the death penalty acts as a deterrent.         Mrs. Morris honed her social conscience in the turbulent South of the 1950's and 60's, during the early days of school desegregation and of passive civil rights protests that were often met by violence.         ''My views on capital punishment have been shaped by my life,'' she  once wrote.         When the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to be reinstated in 1976, Mrs. Morris began to monitor prisoners under sentence of death, trying to find counsel for them. Good-natured but firm, she pressed lawyers in Georgia and elsewhere to accept these cases without fee.         Mrs. Morris was a great-granddaughter of Charles Pratt, a co-founder of Standard Oil and a founder of the Pratt Institute. A daughter of H. Irving Pratt and Ellen H. Pratt, she was born in Manhattan and reared in Glen Cove and Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Morris graduated from Vassar College, where she studied childhood education, in 1952. Later that year, she married Mr. Morris.         The couple moved to the Deep South in 1954, when Mr. Morris was appointed a vicar in Dillon, S.C.         At the end of 1958, they moved to Atlanta, where Mr. Morris became the executive director of the newly formed Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity, a group that supported the civil rights movement and addressed segregation within the Episcopal Church.         Later, the couple helped found the Georgia chapter of the A.C.L.U.         In addition to her husband and her mother, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Pratt is survived by two daughters, Anne B. Morris of Southampton, Mass., and Ellen Morris McCann of Lincoln, Mass.; two sons, Christopher W. Morris of Haverford, Pa., and John B. Morris Jr. of Washington; two sisters, Margaret Cardoza of Brookline, Mass., and Ellen Stoia of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Mildred Custin, who built Bonwit Teller into a leading fashion force in the late 1960's by introducing designers such as Pierre Cardin, Andre Courreges, Emanuel Ungaro and Calvin Klein to the American public, died Thursday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 91.         As president and then chairwoman of the 12-store Bonwit chain from 1965 to 1970, Ms. Custin used extensive retailing experience, superb taste and a sense of daring to impart a high-fashion image to what had been a traditional store selling the same clothing women could buy just about anywhere else. She gave some of the hottest names of the swinging 1960's boutiques in the store, and among the labels sold there were Norman Norell, James Galanos, Donald Brooks, Geoffrey Beene, Pauline Trigere and Rudi Gernreich.         Ms. Custin added masses of fresh flowers to Bonwit's flagship store at 721 Fifth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets, on the sites now occupied by Trump Tower and Niketown.  She filled the store with a series of boutiques, including the famous S'fari Room for trendy fashion, and turned the 57th Street side into a men's haberdashery.         It was a daring move at the time to try to sell men's wear in what had been strictly a women's specialty store. Ms. Custin offered her customers Cardin's neo-Edwardian silhouette, then considered radical, the first Bill Blass men's wear, Hermes ties from Paris and Turnbull & Asser shirts from London. At Christmas time, men were catered to with special shopping evenings.         Ms. Custin never lacked daring. She believed that women were better than men at the fashion business. ''We are more inclined than they are to take risks,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1981. ''All women who have reached the top in fashion did it by risking their necks. If I saw something I liked, I'd fill the store with it. I trusted my judgment.''         Among the fortuitous decisions she made was to give Calvin Klein his first order, for $50,000, in 1968. ''I've told that story so many times,'' Mr. Klein recalled yesterday, ''of wheeling the rack of clothes up Fifth Avenue on a Saturday morning. It wasn't even a collection, it was just fall coats and dresses. She was so supportive to me in those early years with things stores don't do anymore, like free advertising.''         ''She was completely hands on,'' he added, ''totally involved in everything from the fresh flowers to the windows to the advertising. She had a little voice but was a very strong lady with a clear strategy and a vision that was very focused.''         She was also among the first merchants to give elaborate parties in the store, starting with a black-tie supper dance to introduce Norman Norell's first perfume in 1968.         Ms. Custin, a petite woman with silvery hair and a soft, little-girl voice, had a reputation for grace and charm, bulwarked by a capacity for working hard and inspiring others to do the same. In her first year at Bonwit's she noted that all the stores were closed on Washington's Birthday while the streets were crowded with pedestrians, all potential customers. So the next year, she convinced her employees to stay open on the holiday, and the people were in the store, not on the street.         She was born in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 25, 1906, and was reared in Boston, where she graduated from Simmons College. She spent 37 years honing her retailing skills before taking the reins at Bonwit's in New York. Her career began in 1928 in the controller's office at R. H. Macy & Company after she was rejected for the executive training program in retailing.         She returned to Boston and worked at Shepard's, a department store that no longer exists, and then at R. H. White's. In 1935, she went to John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, where she worked her way up from gift buyer to a vice presidency.         In 1958, she was named president of Bonwit Teller Philadelphia, a three-store chain that became part of Bonwit Teller New York in 1963. In Philadelphia she secured her reputation by transforming a drab, rundown store into a paragon of good taste by revamping window and interior displays, advertising and merchandising. It was there that she started sending chatty memos to charge customers along with their monthly bills, a practice she continued in New York.         Approaching Bonwit Teller's mandatory retirement age for executives of 65, Ms. Custin retired as chairwoman and started a new career as a consultant to retail and fashion businesses with her friend Jerrie Rosenberg, the former director of public relations for Bonwit's, as vice president.         It was Ms. Custin's involvement as consultant to the Esplanade, a shopping complex in Palm Beach, that led to her moving there in 1979. She ran her business until 1990.         Ms. Custin is survived by two nieces, Joan Custin of New York and Barbara Poverman of Chestnut Hill, Mass., a great-niece and two great-nephews.       
         Helene Hanff, whose wittily acerbic 20-year correspondence with a London bookseller she never met won her a passionate following after it was published as the epistolary memoir ''84, Charing Cross Road,'' died on Wednesday at the De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 80.         Up to the book's publication in 1970, Ms. Hanff was a relatively unheralded freelance writer whose work centered mainly on television screenplays and children's books. But the letters she addressed to the antiquarian bookshop Marks & Co. from 1949 to 1969, with their shared confidences and affectionate needling along with orders for Jane Austen and Izaak Walton, brought her a small if unanticipated literary celebrity.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Thomas Lask wrote: ''Here is a charmer: a 19th-century book in a 20th-century world. It will beguile an hour of your time and put you in tune with mankind.''         From the beginning of her correspondence, Ms. Hanff ignored the niceties of business letter writing. ''WHAT KIND OF A PEPYS' DIARY DO YOU CALL THIS?,'' she bellowed in an eccentrically capitalized letter of Oct. 15, 1951, after receiving a Marks & Co. shipment. ''this is not pepys' diary, this is some busybody editor's miserable collection of EXCERPTS from pepys' diary may he rot. i could just spit. where is jan. 12, 1668, where his wife chased him out of bed and round the bedroom with a red-hot poker?''         In his replies, Frank Doel, the shop's chief buyer and Ms. Hanff's principal correspondent, strove at first to maintain what she called his ''proper British reserve.'' But little by little, Ms. Hanff wore him down, as she did the other members of the shop's staff. They sent her recipes for Yorkshire pudding. She sent them food parcels and nylon stockings in a one-woman crusade to ameliorate Britain's postwar shortages. And Ms. Hanff often tempered her trans-Atlantic crankiness with rhapsodic soliloquies over the orders that Marks & Co. managed to get right.         ''The Newman arrived almost a week ago and I'm just beginning to recover,'' she wrote in 1950 after buying a first edition of John Henry Newman's ''Idea of a University'' (1852) for $6. ''I feel vaguely guilty about owning it. All that gleaming leather and gold stamping and beautiful type belongs in the pine-paneled library of an English country home; it wants to be read by the fire in a gentleman's leather easy chair -- not on a secondhand studio couch in a one-room hovel in a broken-down brownstone front.''         Despite her origins south of the Battery -- she was a native of Philadelphia -- Ms. Hanff was the Platonic New Yorker to her enchanted London correspondents. Her letters are a window on days spent picnicking in Central Park, rooting ardently for the Dodgers (and later the Mets) and wading into the fray of local politics (she was the first woman to serve as president of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club).         A constant undercurrent in Ms. Hanff's letters was the hand-to-mouth writing life she led, working at home in ''moth-eaten sweaters'' with an overflowing ashtray at her elbow and the gin bottle never far from reach. Despite repeated pleas from Marks & Company staff members to visit them in England (by the 1950's Frank Doel was offering her the use of his grown daughter's bedroom), Ms. Hanff's precarious finances never allowed her to make the trip until 1969, after Mr. Doel's sudden death from peritonitis.         Helene (pronounced heh-LAYNE) Hanff was born on April 15, 1916, in Philadelphia, the daughter of Arthur and Miriam Levy Hanff. She grew up in a theater-mad household (during the Depression, her father, a shirt salesman, took the family to the theater every week by slipping shirts to the box-office men in exchange for tickets), and all she ever wanted to be was a playwright.         Her career began auspiciously in 1938, when she won a fellowship from the Bureau of New Plays as a result of a nationwide competition. Soon afterward, she moved to Manhattan, where she became a protegee of Theresa Helburn, a co-producer of the Theater Guild. But although Ms. Hanff wrote 20 plays through the 1940's, none were ever produced. Her repeated attempts to succeed in New York theater are chronicled in her 1961 memoir, ''Underfoot in Show Business.''         ''I wrote great dialogue, but I couldn't invent a story to save my neck,'' she told The New York Times in 1982. In the 1950's, Ms. Hanff supported herself by writing screenplays for television programs including ''Playhouse 90,'' ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' and ''Hallmark Hall of Fame.''         A child of the Depression, Ms. Hanff could afford only a year of college, and throughout her life was an impassioned autodidact, educating herself by reading the great books, which she preferred to procure from London rather than dip into ''Barnes & Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies.'' One wall of her studio apartment on East 72d Street in Manhattan was filled from floor to ceiling with her Marks & Co. treasures, with their rich leather bindings and gleaming gold stamping. In front of the bookshelves hung the Marks & Co. sign, stolen for her by a devoted ''84'' reader from the shop after it closed, not long after Mr. Doel's death.         When Ms. Hanff decided to publish her correspondence with the shop as a memorial to Mr. Doel, the result brought her undreamed-of attention. ''84, Charing Cross Road'' was hugely popular in Britain, where it was adapted for the London stage by James Roose-Evans. (The play was less well-received on Broadway, where it ran in 1982 with Ellen Burstyn as Ms. Hanff and Joseph Maher as Mr. Doel.) In 1987 the book was made into a feature film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.         The book's success finally gave Ms. Hanff the wherewithal to travel to England, where she visited the boarded-up bookshop and met Mr. Doel's widow, Nora, a journey documented in ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'' (1973). Ms. Hanff's other books include ''Q's Legacy'' (1986), ''Apple of My Eye'' (1977) and the children's titles ''Movers and Shakers'' (1969) and ''Terrible Thomas'' (1964).         ''It's unreal to me, what the last 10 years have been like,'' Ms. Hanff said in 1982. ''The fans -- people all over the world who regard me as a friend! And in London there is a brass plaque on the wall with my name on it, to mark the spot where the bookshop once stood, because I wrote letters to it. In your own mind you're still an uneducated writer who doesn't have much talent, and yet here you are with a plaque on the wall in London! You don't even dream about things like that.''         But ''84, Charing Cross Road'' could not provide its author with the economic stability she sought throughout her life. ''The one drawback about being a writer is that you never know in any month where the rent is coming from six months from then,'' Ms. Hanff told Publishers Weekly in 1985.         In her last years she was ''broke,'' by her own account, living on royalties and Social Security and accepting a $5,000 grant from the Authors League Fund to help pay her hospital bills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died Saturday at her home in East Hampton, L.I.

         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Nancy Claster, who entertained and educated a generation of children as Miss Nancy, the prototypical teacher on television's ''Romper Room,'' died on Friday at her home in Baltimore. She was 82.         Her daughter, Sally Bell, who succeeded her in managing the Romper Room production company, said the cause was cancer.         For millions of children born, weaned, potty trained and sent off to school between the days of radio's ''Uncle Don'' and the advent of ''Sesame Street'' on television in 1969, ''Romper Room'' was the ultimate baby sitter in a box, created to fill a perceived need for better children's programming.         And its presiding spirit was Mrs. Claster, who was pressed into service by her husband as a substitute for an ailing teacher, two months after the live show went on the air in  Baltimore in February 1953.         Not only did she serve as Miss Nancy in the studio-classroom that was her on-air preserve, she also created and wrote many ''Romper Room'' segments and trained the Miss Nancys, Miss Marys, Miss Mollys and Miss Louises who were her counterparts on franchised versions of the show around the country.         ''The core of her curriculum was really the belief that 'Romper Room' was for the children at home,'' Mrs. Bell said, ''and that everything that the children saw on television, whether it was just plain fun or educational -- and a lot of 'Romper Room' was educational -- should be set up so that children at home could participate.         ''If children on television were walking on a balance beam for hand-eye coordination, the children at home were shown how to use a string on the floor, so they didn't have to be kids who had to buy equipment to participate. Everybody could be part of 'Romper Room,' and everybody could have fun and learn from it.''         With its games and lessons, the show was an instant success. By the end of its first week -- a week when a toddler announced on camera: ''I have to go potty! And I'm doing it right now'' -- ''Romper Room'' received 1,100 applications to appear on the show. By the late 1950's, some 160 cities were broadcasting their own versions.         The show, which ran in markets around the country until September 1994, when new production ceased, can still be seen on tape on KTVU in San Francisco.         ''Romper Room'' was home-grown television in the days before videotape, a show that brought preschoolers into a studio furnished as a kindergarten and let the cameras roll.         Songs, games and health lessons helped ready children for the first grade. Animals were brought in from the zoo. To allay children's fear of the doctor, Miss Nancy got genuine polio shots on the air. Preschoolers were taught by people in gold and black fake-fur bee costumes to Do-Bee a milk drinker and Don't-Bee a spoilsport.         Each broadcast ended with the Magic Mirror, a piece of glittery plastic through which the teacher ''saw'' children at home.         Hundreds of children submitted their names and hoped to hear them when the teacher said: ''Romper stomper bomper boo/Tell me, tell me, tell me do/Magic Mirror, tell me today/ Did all my friends have fun at play?/I see Donnie and Leslie and Peter and Rhonda.''         It was perhaps inevitable that a little girl was watching at home, naked in a bathtub, when Miss Sally said she saw her in the Magic Mirror. The girl fled, hid beneath her bed, stayed there for hours and still remembered the episode 30 years later.         Born in Baltimore, Mrs. Claster was the oldest of three children of L. Edwin Goldman, the managing partner of a law firm, and the former Rita Strauss, who passed on her sense of fun to the future Miss Nancy.         Mrs. Claster was educated at the Park School, a private school in Baltimore, before attending Goucher College in Towson, Md., where she studied English and early-childhood education and graduated in 1937 with a bachelor of arts degree.         In 1938, she married Bertram Claster, then managing a beauty supply sales company. By the 1940's, at the Hippodrome theater in Baltimore, he was producing variety shows with stars like Gene Autry, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Rosemary Clooney, Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra and Rudy Vallee.         When television came along, he produced some local variety shows; being farsighted, he realized that the days of shows like those at the Hippodrome were numbered. He produced game and variety shows, from ''Bowling for Dollars'' to ''Teen Canteen.''         But dissatisfied with what he could see of morning programs for children, he created ''Romper Room.''         When cancer forced Mrs. Claster to step aside as Miss Nancy in 1964, she continued to oversee the training of ''Romper Room'' teachers, created different segments of the show and helped her husband sell the show to stations in markets around the country.         Their production company, Romper Room Inc., was bought by Hasbro Inc., in 1969. The Clasters retired in 1975. Mr. Claster died in 1984. Today, their son, John, and Mrs. Bell, as president and executive vice president, respectively, continue to manage the company, now Claster Television Inc.         Besides Mr. Claster of Los Angeles and Mrs. Bell, of Baltimore, Mrs. Claster is survived by another daughter, Candace Claster; a brother, Robert Goldman, and a sister, Sue Baker, all of Baltimore, and four grandchilden.         After retirement, Mrs. Claster spent a good deal of her time reading to and playing with the children at the Maryland School for the Blind in Baltimore.         ''They knew her as Miss Nancy,'' Mrs. Bell said.       
         Ann Petry, who took a single stretch of Harlem and brought it vividly and disturbingly to life in her acclaimed 1946 novel, ''The Street,'' died on Monday at a convalescent center near her home in Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 88.         So much has been written about the hard life on the the mean streets of Harlem, it may seem surprising that the first major literary work to focus on that life would be a first novel by a woman who not only had not grown up there but whose exposure to Harlem street culture had been limited to nine months working with an experimental after-school program on West 116th Street.         But then Ann Lane Petry was a surprising woman, one of such enormous empathy and imaginative flair that she did not need to encounter many bereft latchkey children, their desperate, beleaguered mothers or the assortment of opportunistic men who preyed on them to translate her observations into literature.         Half a century after ''The Street,'' was first published by Houghton-Mifflin, Mrs. Petry's creations, Ludie Johnson and her 8-year-old son Bub, are still regarded as among the more indelible characters of black literature.         One reason, perhaps, that Harlem street life had such a powerful impact on Mrs. Petry, was that it was so far removed from her own genteel upbringing. A native of Old Saybrook, where her father, Peter Lane, had opened a pharmacy in 1902, she grew up in one of the few black families in the white resort.         Several members of her mother's family were pharmacists, too, and in time Mrs. Petry graduated from the College of Pharmacy at the University of Connecticut and went to work at her father's store.         But ever since a high school teacher who did not like her had praised her work and said she could become a writer, she had been writing stories and, as she later put it, gathering rejection slips.         Her life began to change in 1938 when she married George Petry, a Louisiana-born resident of Harlem she had met while both were visiting friends in Hartford.         The couple settled in Harlem, and Mrs. Petry held a variety of jobs, including writing advertising copy for The Amsterdam News and working as a reporter and editor of the women's pages of The People's Voice, a weekly started by Adam Clayton Powell Jr.         When The Crisis, a magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, paid her $20 for one of her stories, ''On Saturday, the Sirens at Noon,'' it came to the attention of an editor at Houghton-Mifflin and led to both a $2,500 literary award and a contract for what became ''The Street.''         Mrs. Petry, who had written the book while her husband was in the service in World War II, was not quite prepared for the stir it created when it was published to both critical and popular acclaim. But ''The Street,'' which sold 1.5 million copies, gave Mrs. Petry the wherewithal to retreat back to Old Saybrook, where she and her husband settled in a 200-year-old sea captain's house and got an unlisted telephone number.         She followed ''The Street,'' with two other novels, ''Country Place,'' (1947) about about a serviceman who returns from the war to discover his wife is having an affair, and ''The Narrows,'' (1953) about an interracial affair.         Neither enjoyed the critical or commercial success of her first novel, however, and from then on Mrs. Petry, by then a mother, turned out books for children and young adults, among them two biographies, ''Tituba of Salem Village,'' and ''Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad.''         She also brought out a collection of her short stories, ''Legends of the Saints,'' but after its publication in 1970, she limited her output to articles for college journals and the like.         Mrs. Petry had to endure a fresh burst of fame in 1992 when ''The Street,'' was reissued in paperback to a new round of acclaim.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Elisabeth, of Cromwell, Conn.       
         Dr. Ruth Sager, a geneticist who carried out influential research about the location of genetic material in cells, died on Saturday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 79.         She had cancer of the bladder, said her husband, Dr. Arthur B. Pardee.         At her death, Dr. Sager was chief of cancer genetics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. She joined the institute's staff in 1975. She was also a professor of cellular genetics at the medical school from 1975 until she retired from that post in 1988 as a professor emerita.         Dr. Sager was widely known for research that altered the prevailing view about where genetic material was within the cell. That work began in the 1950's and came to fruition in the 1960's.         Dr. Charles D. Stiles, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Institute, said Dr. Sager had made a ''revolutionary discovery'' while doing research at the Rockefeller Institute, now Rockefeller University, and later at Columbia University. Before her research, Professor Stiles said, the view was widespread ''that all genetic information was sequestered in the nucleus of the cell.''         ''But what Ruth said,'' he added, ''was that important fragments of the genetic repertoire were located in the cell cytoplasm,'' outside the cell's nucleus in the cellular organelles where it does its respiration (and, in the case of plants, photosynthesis).         Dr. Lawrence Bogorad, the Maria Moors Cabot Professor of Biology emeritus at Harvard University, said the alterations that Dr. Sager achieved ''in the way people thought about extranuclear genetic material, that is, genes in the cell outside the nucleus,'' had proved to be highly significant.         ''These days, scientists know a lot about most of the genes in the organelles,'' Dr. Bogorad said. ''Increasing numbers of human diseases that result from mutations in genes in respiratory organelles are becoming recognized. These discoveries are direct results of the change of thinking about the problem that Ruth's work brought about.''         ''In the latter half of her career, Ruth turned her attention to problems in cancer and in human genetics,'' Dr. Stiles said. When Dr. Sager moved to the Dana-Farber Institute in 1975, he said, ''she quickly saw the potential of recombinant DNA technology, a technology that was then in its infancy'' and involves the manipulation of genetic material to explore basic biological questions.         ''Her main contribution at the institute was to recognize, quickly and early on, the potential and the power of cloning technology,'' he said.         Dr. Sager established the institute's division of cancer genetics and recruited able young scientists for its staff. Many of them have become prominent in genetics.         She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The honors she received included the  the Gilbert Morgan Smith Medal from the national academy, an Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Cancer Institute and a Guggenheim fellowship.         Dr. Sager was born in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree in 1938 from the University of Chicago and a doctorate in 1948 from Columbia. After becoming a senior research associate at Columbia, she was a professor at Hunter College from 1966 to 1975.         In addition to her husband, a professor emeritus of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the division of cell growth and regulation at the Dana-Farber Institute,  Dr. Sager is survived by two sisters, Esther Altschul of Wilmette, Ill., and Dr. Naomi Sager of Manhattan.       
         Thelma Carpenter, whose long roller-coaster career as a singer took her to the heights with the big bands of the 1930's and 40's, out of show business into years as a file clerk and back to the big-time on Broadway in the 60's, was found dead on Thursday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 77.         Detective Thomas A. Frey of the 24th Squad said Ms. Carpenter's death appeared to be the result of natural causes.         ''I'm a singer first, last and always,'' Ms. Carpenter once said.         And indeed she was, from the time she was 7 and asked the manager of a radio ''Kiddies Hour'' for an audition until the end of her life, when she performed at places like Michael's Pub and on ''The Cosby Show.''         At the height of her career, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Carpenter, who combined a bubbling, buoyant personality with a pliant voice and a polished sense of showmanship, sang with such jazz greats as Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins and Count Basie.         On the supper club circuit, she was a soloist at Julius Monk's Ruban Bleu, the Maisonette at the St. Regis and Bon Soir in Greenwich Village.         She made her Broadway debut in 1944 in ''Memphis Bound'' with Bill Robinson, appeared in ''Ankles Away'' with Beatrice Lillie, created the role of Irene Page in ''Bubbling Brown Sugar'' and took on a starring role in ''Dolly!'' in 1968 and 1969, when she became Pearl Bailey's standby and portrayed Dolly Levi more than 100 times.         She performed in such films as ''Hellzapoppin' '' (1941), singing with the Basie orchestra, ''The Wiz'' (1978) and ''The Cotton Club,'' Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film about gangsters and Harlem nightlife.         On radio and television, Ms. Carpenter appeared with Eddie Cantor and Ed Sullivan, was a co-star of the ABC television series ''Barefoot in the Park'' and made guest appearances in everything from ''The Love boat'' to ''The Cosby Show.''         When ''Barefoot in the Park'' was canceled in 1970 after 13 weeks, as when she was out of show business for several years after her mother died in 1962, Ms. Carpenter, while disappointed, refused to turn bitter.         ''My grandaddy taught me something I've never forgotten,'' she said in a 1970 interview. ''What you need is so much more important to you than what you want. Anyway, I've never aspired to be a superstar. You talk about stardom, well, your nose bleeds up there. I got close enough to know. Suddenly there were people I'd never seen, telling me I owed them something. Listen, I've given my money away, where I thought it would help, but I don't want 'yes' people around me. Basically I'm a loner.''         Ms. Carpenter, who left no immediate family survivors, was an only child and never married. ''Yes, I've never married, though you might say,'' she said in 1970, ''that I've done lots of heavy rooming and light housekeeping in my time. Honey, I like life.''         Ms. Carpenter was still a student at Girls' Commercial High School of Brooklyn in 1939 when she was heard by John Hammond, the jazz enthusiast and recording executive who had started Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman and Count Basie on the way to stardom. Mr. Hammond put her on with Teddy Wilson's band at the Famous Door on 52d Street.         Later that year, Coleman Hawkins, the legendary jazz saxophonist, returned to the United States after five years in Europe, formed a band and looked for a singer. ''They make 'em like you in America?'' he asked when he saw Ms. Carpenter. ''You can have the job.''         Ms. Carpenter's career prospered in the United States and abroad, but when her mother died, she said, ''I just lay down in my bed for a whole year.'' Finally, when she needed money, she went looking for a job, applying at a personnel agency that found work as a file clerk at Duffy-Mott, makers of Mott's Applesauce.         When her friend Martha Raye told her there was going to be an all-black company of ''Hello, Dolly!'' Ms. Carpenter went to see the show when Ginger Rogers was playing the lead. ''Son of a gun, I could do that!'' Ms. Carpenter told herself. Pearl Bailey got the role, but when her original standby left, Ms. Carpenter took over the role.         ''I had to go out there and face an audience that had just been told that Pearl Bailey won't be there,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''I decided I was either going to be Dolly or I wasn't going to be Dolly. 'You don't have to pay me,' I felt, 'just applaud me.' And when they'd stand up and cheer, I'd won.''         Correction:  May 30, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the singer Thelma Carpenter on May 17 misidentified the Broadway show in which she appeared with Beatrice Lillie. It was ''Inside U.S.A.,'' not ''Ankles Aweigh.''       
         Queen Mother Moore, a civil rights worker and black nationalist, died on Friday in a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 98 and a longtime resident of Harlem.         Miss Moore, whose real name was Audley Moore, was a hero to many residents of Harlem, where she worked with Marcus Garvey, the Jamaican-born black nationalist leader, and his Back-to-Africa movement. She was also an advocate of reparations for slavery, tenants' rights and education for the poor.         Howard Dodson, the head of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, in Harlem, said in 1995 that her career constituted ''a link between the best elements of the nationalist and radical left political traditions in Harlem over the past five, six decades.''         Miss Moore came to be called Queen Mother during a trip to Africa years ago, when a tribe in Ghana awarded her the honorary title. In Africa, as she once put it, ''I felt the lash on the backs of my people.''         Her outrage over the suffering of blacks in America led to years of political action. ''They not only called us Negroes, they made us Negroes,'' she once said, ''things that don't know where they came from and don't even care that they don't know. Negro is a state of mind, and they massacred our minds.''         Audley Eloise Moore was born in New Iberia, La., a town west of New Orleans. Her family's past reflected the racism she fought: one of her grandfathers was lynched, and one of her grandmothers, a slave, was raped by a white man.         Miss Moore's parents died when she was young, and she dropped out of school, becoming a hairdresser. Largely self-educated, she was inspired by the writings of Frederick Douglass and by Garvey's oratory, which she first heard in New Orleans. She was also fond of Nelson Mandela's dictum, ''The struggle is my life.''         Stirred by Garvey's pride in blacks' African heritage, Miss Moore and her two sisters went to Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. There, she married Frank Warner.         In Harlem, Miss Moore became prominent in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the organization Garvey founded in 1914.         Beginning in the 1960's, Miss Moore was among black leaders demanding reparations from the United States Government for the sufferings of blacks under slavery. In 1994, she addressed a conference in Detroit of the the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, where she declared, in a voice gone soft and husky with age: ''Reparations. Reparations. Keep on. Keep on. We've got to win.''         In 1966, Miss Moore was among parents and civil rights workers who staged a sit-in in the Board of Education's meeting hall in Brooklyn, where the protesters accused board members of neglecting the needs of schools in poor neighborhoods.         Miss Moore said of the district superintendents: ''Run them out. They're perpetuating idiot factories among us.''         In 1989, Miss Moore and more than 40 other prominent black women were honored at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, in Washington, where ''I Dream a World,'' an exhibition of photographs of them by Brian Lanker, was on display.         ''These women are bound by their grit and unquenchable spirit,'' Marion Wright Edelman, a civil rights lawyer and the executive director of the Children's Defense fund, said at the show. ''They lifted the veil of impossibility despite the barriers of race and sex.''         Miss Moore's husband died in 1967. She is survived by a son, Thomas O. Warner of Philadelphia, five grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Rose Will Monroe, an employee of an aircraft factory who, through a chance meeting with a Hollywood star, became the celebrated ''Rosie the Riveter'' in World War II, died on Saturday in Clarksville, Ind. She was 77, and a resident of Clarksville.         Mrs. Monroe's remaining kidney began to fail two years ago, and that led to her death, her family said.         The Rosie character depicted in the widely distributed poster by J. Howard Miller became a patriotic depiction of working women, but the image itself was fictional. Mrs. Monroe appeared in a promotional film for war bonds after Walter Pidgeon, the actor, discovered her at an aircraft parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich., said Mrs. Monroe's daughter, Vicki Jarvis of Clarksville.         Mr. Pidgeon had gone to the Willow Run Aircraft Factory to appear in the promotional film and found out that there was a woman named Rose who was a riveter, Mrs. Jarvis said. The song ''Rosie the Riveter'' by Kay Kyser, inspired by a Long Island woman named Rosalind P. Walter, was already a hit. And the poster, with the title ''We Can Do It'' above a painting of a muscle-flexing woman in a bandanna and overalls, was becoming a worldwide symbol of women in the defense industry in World War II. A real Rosie the Riveter, Mrs. Jarvis said, proved too good for the film's producers to resist.         ''Mom happened to be in the right place at the right time,'' Mrs. Jarvis said yesterday.         Indeed, Mrs. Monroe was the quintessential wartime mother, said Mrs. Jarvis, who had not yet been born when her mother took the job at Willow Run in the early 1940's. Left with two young children after her husband was killed in a car accident, Mrs. Monroe, like millions of other women nationwide, joined the work force both to fulfill a call to arms, so to speak, and to support her family.         ''They couldn't find a better role model, to be honest,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ''Everything she does, she does well. She makes it very tough for the rest of us to follow in her footsteps.''         Even before she became a riveter, Mrs. Monroe had proven herself while growing up in Somerset, Ky., her daughter said. ''There were nine brothers and sisters,'' she said. ''She was the one who was a tomboy who could use tools. She could do everything.''         Despite her brief fame as Rosie the Riveter in the film, which was shown in theaters between features to encourage viewers to buy war bonds, Mrs. Monroe never capitalized on the role, Mrs. Jarvis said. She remained a tireless worker after the war, driving a cab, operating a beauty shop and founding Rose Builders, a construction company that specialized in luxury homes, her daughter said.         ''My mother was the type of person who never believed in government assistance,'' Mrs. Jarvis said.         During the war, Mrs. Monroe had hoped to be among the women chosen to learn to fly and transport aircraft parts around the nation, but she was passed over because she was a single mother, Mrs. Jarvis said. But Mrs. Monroe achieved her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot when she was in her 50's.         ''She was a member of the local aeronautics club -- the only female member, of course,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ''She was quite a good pilot. She taught me how to fly.''         But Mrs. Monroe's love of flying resulted in an accident in 1978 that contributed to her death 19 years later. Out for an afternoon flight with her daughter and four other people, Mrs. Monroe's small propeller plane stalled on takeoff and plunged to the ground. While the passengers were not seriously hurt, Mrs. Monroe lost a kidney and the vision in her left eye, which ended her career as a solo pilot.         In addition to Mrs. Jarvis, Mrs. Monroe is survived by another daughter, Connie Gibson, of Clarksville; six sisters, Vera Gastineau and Lelia Stiers of Lafayette, Ind., Gladys Jones of Merritt Island, Fla., Eula Stone of Jeffersontown, Ky., Flonnie Cope of Lake Worth, Fla., and Christine Witt of Port Clinton, Ohio; nine grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep. Her desk is strewn with folders and a hammer and a screwdriver for removing photos from the wood-paneled wall.         Dr. Hibberd, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner, is making an abrupt and highly publicized career change in a life that has never worked out quite the way she planned.         Her pattern was set early, when hopes of becoming a naturalist were thwarted by a graduate program's males-only policy. Since then, her zigzag career as a scientist and pediatrician has taken her to a remote Montana Indian reservation, the squalor of Bangladesh and the poorest neighborhoods of Long Island.         None of it seemed to prepare Dr. Hibberd for the rough and tumble of politics in Suffolk County. She says she was ousted because she would not play patronage games; her detractors disputed her health policies and said she was a poor manager. In any case, by Friday, she will have vacated her office.         As Dr. Hibberd sorted through her things, she said, ''Look -- here's something.'' It was the plaque commemorating her induction in March into the Suffolk County Women's Hall of Fame. Etched at the bottom is the name of County Executive Robert J. Gaffney -- who two months later, without warning, created a committee to search for her successor.         Dr. Hibberd was in Virginia picking up her daughter from college, and found out when she called her answering machine from a pay phone in a Wendy's and heard urgent messages from reporters.         ''It was very painful,'' she recalled. ''I was crying and saying it's not fair -- I'm not there to defend myself. We drove back home in this big line of violent thunderstorms. It seemed like the perfect metaphor.''         Mr. Gaffney said his decision stemmed from a growing rift with Dr. Hibberd over health policies. He also questioned her management skills, saying that her agency had failed to get millions of dollars in state aid, that malpractice expenses were high and that its managed-care system was floundering.         Dr. Hibberd rebutted his complaints, saying, for example, that Suffolk would get all its state aid after the normal lags in claims, payments and budget cycles. But she also mounted a counterattack, saying that the real reason for her removal was that she blocked attempts at  interference by Mr. Gaffney, his top aides, two legislators and others.         Over the years, she said, those officials had tried to foist unqualified but politically connected job candidates on her agency. She said they also tried to force her agency to spend money advertising in a politically connected newspaper and tried to strong-arm her into backing off on smoking regulations to help their business friends.         Dr. Hibberd, 50, a divorced mother of two who is given to quoting Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said she would not give in. ''My duty is to protect the public health, not to engage in politics,'' she said.         Nor did she seem concerned about losing her job. ''I always think God has a plan, even though we don't know it,'' she said.         Dr. Hibberd has a legion of admirers who see her as a Mother Teresa who championed suburbia's invisible needy, and, in the process, cut Suffolk's infant mortality rate by more than 40 percent.         ''Mary is credible, and the rest of them aren't,'' said Maxine Postal, a Democrat and chairwoman of the County Legislature's Health Committee. ''That slim woman has a backbone made of tempered steel. From the person who does the maintenance work right up to the top, they say she's the very best we've ever had.''         Mr. Gaffney and the other officials denied the charges of interference. Mr. Gaffney declined to be interviewed for this article.         Although some people called for an investigation get to the bottom of the dispute, there appears little chance of that. Instead, Dr. Hibberd will start a new job Monday as a senior executive at Ipro, a health-care consulting firm in Lake Success.         Growing up in Upper Darby, Pa., Dr. Hibberd never envisioned that she would some day be at the helm of a $275 million-a-year health agency.         ''It was actually a fluky thing,'' Dr. Hibberd said of her career. Her own requirement was to find something ''that was work I wanted to do and that made a difference.'' After being shut out of the naturalists' program, she earned a master's degree in microbial genetics, then another in human genetics, which led her into medicine.         ''I liked surgery best, but women rarely went into that,'' she said, so she shifted to pediatrics. In nearly five years practicing at the Flathead Indian reservation, she realized the medical toll of social and economic ills. ''I saw a lot of unemployment, alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome.''         Her career was transformed again by 10 months as a volunteer in the Care Medico program in Bangladesh. ''People went blind from lack of vitamin A. There was scurvy, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, TB -- all preventable. You could save thousands.''         She earned a master's degree in public health and took a residency in community and preventive health at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. A stint at the Suffolk Health Department prompted a job offer, and she became director of reproductive care for six years. County Executive Patrick Halpin named her acting health commissioner in 1991, and Mr. Gaffney made the appointment permanent.         Many trace her undoing to a dispute four years ago with Suffolk's District Attorney, James Catterson Jr.         She accused Mr. Catterson of threatening to investigate her agency unless she overturned the failing results of a psychological exam given to a son of a longtime associate of his. The son, an investigator in Mr. Catterson's office, needed to pass for authorization to carry a gun.         Perhaps emboldened by Dr. Hibberd, other Republican officials also began to speak out, saying that Mr. Catterson had improperly pressured them on various issues. But he denied all the complaints, and a state inquiry ended with no action taken against him.         ''There's a pattern here of someone who sees things that other people don't,'' Mr. Catterson said in an interview. ''I've never understood her agenda.'' He said Dr. Hibberd had been ''canonized'' by the news media, but he conceded, ''She comes across in private as she does in public, as Mother Teresa, and it's very disarming.''         Her tenacity, however, hardly ingratiated her with Mr. Gaffney. This year she went over his head to the County Legislature to win more funds for her department.         About the last thing to come down from Dr. Hibberd's office wall was a display of 13 color snapshots of beaming mothers and their babies from Project Hope, in which health workers monitor infants through their critical first year.         ''This is one of the programs I started and one of the best things in the department,'' she said. ''So I am definitely taking these pictures. It just makes you feel good.''       
         Frances Foster, a character actress, a stage director and a founding member of the Negro Ensemble Company, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and in Far Rockaway, Queens.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Hattie Winston, a friend, who said Ms. Foster was in Virginia to attend a stepgrandson's high school graduation.         Ms. Foster was at the Negro Ensemble Company from 1967 until 1986, appearing in more than 25 of its productions. She won an Obie Award in 1985 for sustained excellence of performance.         The other honors she received included one of the company's Adolph Caesar awards in 1987 and two of the annual Audelco Awards, which honor achievement in black theater: a best actress award in 1978 for ''Do Lord Remember Me,'' and a best director award for 1983 for ''Hospice.'' Both plays were at the New Federal Theater in Manhattan.         Ms. Foster made her stage debut as Dolly May in ''The Wisteria Trees'' at the City Center Theater in 1955, and her talent proved durable. She won praise for her portrayal of a matriarchal Mississippi grandmother in Leslie Lee's 1990 play ''Ground People.'' Reviewing it when it opened at the American Place Theater, Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote, ''Just sitting in her kitchen, lining the thin soles of her shoes with paper while telling tales of her midwifery, Ms. Foster is a moving presence, as she has been in many other plays.''         Another critic, reviewing the play ''You Have Come Back,'' set in Algeria, at St. Clement's Church in Manhattan in 1988, wrote, ''Frances Foster gives such a superb performance as the 103-year-old nurse that it is a revelation just to watch her move about the stage, creating an old Algerian woman out of a few lines.''         And Frank Rich of The Times wrote admiringly in 1985 that Ms. Foster was ''a big woman'' with ''a big repertory of comic voices, ranging from a raspy belt to a maternal croon to a ditsy English matron's stiff-upper-register.''         Her work in television included acting in daytime television staples like ''One Life to Live,'' ''Ryan's Hope'' and ''All My Children.'' She also appeared in the Spike Lee movies ''Malcolm X'' (1992) and ''Crooklyn'' (1994) and in other films. She was on the Actors Equity Association council from 1953 to 1967 and an artist in residence at City College of New York from 1973 to 1977.         Ms. Foster, born Frances Brown in Yonkers. where she was brought up,  studied acting at American Theater Wing in Manhattan from 1949 to 1952.         She married Robert Standfield Foster in 1941. He died in 1977.         She is survived by her husband of 14 years, Morton Goldsen; a son, Terrell Foster, of San Francisco; three stepchildren; six stepgrandchildren, and a sister, Beverly Tate of Far Rockaway.       
         Joan Daves, a leading literary agent whose client list included six Nobel Prize winners, died on Wednesday at her home in Bedford, N.Y. Ms. Davis, who also had a home in Manhattan, was 77.         Her husband, Joe H. Kirchberger, said the cause was an acute asthmatic attack.         For decades, Ms. Daves was regarded as one of the world's foremost agents for serious and intellectual fiction and nonfiction. Her Nobel Prize-winning clients included Heinrich Boll (1972), Elias Canetti (1981), Herman Hesse (1946), the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1964), Nelly Sachs (1966) and Gabriela Mistral (1945). All but Dr. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and took Ms. Daves with him to Stockholm when he received the award, were laureates in literature.         Ms. Daves (pronounced DAY-vis) also represented such renowned authors as Frank O'Connor, Isaac Babel, Vaclav Havel and Rachel Carson, the trailblazing environmentalist who wrote ''Silent Spring'' and ''The Sea Around Us.''         ''She loved these authors, which conjures up another world; it wasn't the fast buck,'' said Jennifer Lyons, who became her associate when Ms. Daves affiliated her one-woman agency in 1987 with a larger Manhattan agency, Writers House, to secure the interests of her authors as she grew older. ''There was a real passion for authors themselves, for artists and for literature that is rare today.''         Robert Weil, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, recalled that Ms. Daves became familiar with Dr. King in the early 1950's before he achieved national prominence while leading the 1955 boycott of the segregated transit system in Montgomery, Ala.         Mr. Weil said Ms. Daves told a friend that there was an extremely articulate, charismatic and visionary minister from the South she had to meet. ''She could spot very early people's genius and people's talent,'' Mr. Weil said. ''She also sided with the underdog.''         In addition, Mr. Weil said: ''She was literature. She was a brilliant critic, a brilliant reader. She was extremely nurturing. She had a social flair as well. She was a great person to put together people as if she ran a salon in New York which combined the writers of post-World War II European literature with the needs of American publishers.''         In the sale of American rights, the Joan Daves Agency also represented a number of distinguished foreign publishers, like Kinderbuch Verlag of Switzerland, the German concerns Carl Hanser Verlag of Munich and Verlag Kipenheuer und Witsch of Cologne, and the Austrian concern Residenz Verlag of Salzburg.         Ms. Daves, who was later to Americanize her name, was born in Berlin in 1919 and grew up as Liselotte Davidson. She was the middle child and younger daughter of a Jewish banker who was to die in Auschwitz.         In the mid-1930's after the Nazis came to power, her father sent her to Paris, where she became fluent in French. She was forced to return to Berlin when the Nazis imposed currency restrictions on Jews, but she reached Britain in 1938 and followed her sister to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City.         An avid reader who was always interested in books, she worked for a couple of years for Interscience Publishers, publishers of scientific books and books by refugees. In 1942, she went to work as an editor for Harper & Brothers, where she started the Harper's Art Library, which issued books about Durer and Flemish and French master drawings.         In the early 1950's she established the Joan Daves Agency and used her European connections to attract the Continent's foremost writers.         Besides her husband, Ms. Daves is survived by a brother, Peter Davidson of Las Vegas.         In 1992, in ceremonies at the consulate in Manhattan, Ms. Daves was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in recognition of a lifetime of advancement of German culture and literature.       
         Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious, a Chicago lawyer who held high posts in the Nixon and Bush Administrations, was active in the civil rights movement and was on the boards of major corporations, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 75.         The cause of death was breast cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a Republican, was known as Jewel S. Lafontant when she served in the Nixon and Bush Administrations. Prior to that, President Richard M. Nixon had appointed her to the Justice Department as Deputy Solicitor General -- the first woman and the first black person to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office.  She held that post from 1973 to 1975. Under President George Bush, from 1989 to 1993, she was in the State Department with the concurrent titles of ambassador-at-large and coordinator of refugee affairs.         In the civil rights field, she was a founding member of the Congress of Racial Equality, an officer of the Chicago chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. During the early 1940's, The Chicago Sun-Times reported yesterday, ''She brought change to the city by participating in sit-ins at Loop restaurants.'' In a 1991 interview, she recalled, ''Often we were spat upon and physically abused.''         Times changed, and from 1965 to 1967 she was on the President's Council on Minority Business Enterprise. In the early 1970's Ebony magazine named her one of the 100 most influential black Americans.         The corporate boards she was on over the years included those of the Mobil Corporation, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Trans World Airlines, Revlon, Inc., Harte-Hanks Communications, the Hanes Corporation and the Bendix Corporation         During her career, she was also a director of nonprofit institutions including Oberlin College, Howard University and Tuskegee Institute. And she received numerous awards and honorary degrees.         At her death she was a partner in the Chicago law firm of Holleb & Coff, which she joined in 1993. Her law practice, in her years there, was concentrated in the areas of corporate law, labor and employment law, and governmental and international relations.         Jewel Stradford was born in Chicago, the daughter of C. Francis Stradford -- a lawyer -- and Aida Arabella Cartera, and grew up there. She graduated in 1943 from Oberlin College and received a law degree in 1946 from the University of Chicago.         But afterward, The Sun-Times reported, she could not obtain office space, no major white law firm would employ her, and the Chigago Bar Association would not admit her as a member. In 1947, she went to work in the legal aid bureau of a charitable organization, before going on to work for a succession of Chicago law firms and doing much trial work.         During the Eisenhower Administration, from 1955 to 1958, she served as assistant United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1960, she seconded the nomination of Mr. Nixon as Republican candidate for President, but he was defeated by John F. Kennedy.         As the Bush Administration's coordinator for refugee affairs, she dealt with a staggering variety of problems. In 1989, when Moscow was permitting record numbers of Soviet Jews and Pentecostals to leave its soil, she declared that the Bush Adminstration wanted to ''get control over the flow'' of emigres. In 1990, she went to London and reaffirmed a Bush Administration pledge that the United States would help to settle half of all new Vietnamese boat people -- refugees who fled their country by sea and mostly went to camps in the British crown colony of Hong Kong.         In the same year, she went to the African nation of Malawi, which had been flooded with refugees from a civil war in neighboring Mozambique.         Her 1946 marriage to John Rogers ended in divorce in 1961. Later that year she married H. Ernest Lafontant, and he died in 1976.         She is survived by her husband of seven years, Naguib S. Mankarious; a son, John W. Rogers Jr. of Chicago, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  June 13, 1997, Friday         The obituary of Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious on June 3 referred incorrectly to a distinction she attained when she became Deputy Solicitor General of the United States in 1973. While she was the first woman to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office, she was not the highest-ranking black staff member. That was Thurgood Marshall, who became Solicitor General in 1965.       
         Annie Fratellini, who wiggled, waddled and waltzed through big tops in Europe before she opened a college for aspiring circus performers who wanted to follow in her outsized, floppy footsteps, died on Tuesday in Paris. She was 64.         The cause was cancer. The National Circus School, which she started in the 1970's and which is credited with training dozens of clowns and other circus workers, said that she had been hospitalized in a clinic outside Paris since June 10.         ''She harkened back to the golden age of clowning in France,'' said Paul Binder, a founder of the Big Apple Circus, who worked with Miss Fratellini in the 1970's after she saw him juggling on television. ''If there had been no Annie Fratellini, there would be no Big Apple Circus. She brought us to her circus and showed us the beauty of the intimate theatrical circus, and that was the inspiration for our circus.''         Miss Fratellini, born in a trunk, the fourth generation of one of Europe's most famous circus families, was neither as droopy as Emmett Kelly nor as boisterous as Bozo. But for years she avoided following her father, grandfather and 22 other relatives into the ring. Instead, she sang in music halls and nightclubs until 1960, when she met and married Pierre Etaix, the person she credited with making her take her talent for clowning seriously.         ''I was born a clown,'' she said in 1977. ''I never felt comfortable as a woman. It took Pierre to recognize that.''         In the ring, Mr. Etaix was the serious one who specialized in elegant sleight-of-hand. Miss Fratellini was dizzy and outlandish-looking, an overgrown child with a painted-on smile and half-moon eyebrows. When Mr. Etaix lifted off his top hat with a flourish, she was standing by with water to dump in it. When she had the spotlight to herself, she would play two concertinas at once, or try to. She would let the two instruments cascade toward the ground like a waterfall as she made the crowd laugh with her body-bending stage business.         Or she would poke fun at French expressions like ''Il est encore jeune'' (it is still too young), which is normally used to describe wine that is not mature enough to drink. Mr. Etaix would go onstage playing a baritone saxophone. She would step into the spotlight with a miniature sax and interrupt him.         ''Why is that saxophone so small?'' he would ask.         ''Il est encore jeune,'' she would reply.         But Miss Fratellini did not get many laughs at her debut. ''Circus people didn't believe that a woman could take pratfalls, get slapped and kicked and be ridiculous,'' she recalled in 1977, arguing passionately that women could be acclaimed clowns.         ''A clown is sexless, so you must hide your breasts and face,'' she said. ''But women have more sensitivity, the essential quality. It's not a question of gaiety or humor. A clown isn't a comedian. To be a good clown you must have lived.''         The National Circus School eventually offered courses in such circus essentials as magic, trapeze, gymnastics and tightrope walking. But at first all she had was a subsidy from the French Government, a trapeze and a tightrope. Six months later she bought a tent. One thing this taught her students was how to concentrate, for the would-be clowns had to practice their juggling while wobbly unicyclists zipped between them.         ''To be a clown means more than just putting on a costume and making funny faces at the audience,'' Miss Fratellini said in 1993. ''The clown must take the audience on a unique adventure in a strange dimension.''         But Miss Fratellini cautioned her students that a circus performer's life was not as glamorous as it probably appeared to the audience. ''It's terribly grueling -- too much travel and tough physically,'' she said.         But it was not a lesson that her students absorbed. Her daughter, Valerie, is an accomplished trapeeze artist. Her brother Victor worked and taught at the school.         Miss Fratellini, who is survived by Mr. Etaix as well as her daughter, also appeared in several movies, including ''Zazie Dans le Metro,'' a 1961 film by Louis Malle.       
         Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.         Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood.         The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as ''the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.''         The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.         Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler ''the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life.'' Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that ''her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come,'' particularly its cultural life.         Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.         She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.         During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.         When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.         ''She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done,'' said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. ''She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities.''         Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be ''tough, but not intractable,'' someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually ''usually got her way.''         Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.         ''She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles,'' said David Halberstam, whose book, ''The Powers That Be,'' chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. ''If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player.''         At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.         ''Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language,'' he said. ''It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them.''         Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.         In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.         She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.         Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.         One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.         ''I think of myself as a catalyst,'' she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. ''There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job.''       
         Elizabeth Jennings Howell, a fund-raiser and volunteer at such New York institutions as Goddard Riverside Community Center and International House, died on Monday at her home in Washington Crossing, Pa. She was 84 and a former resident of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.         Betsy Howell, as she was known, was a director of Goddard Riverside, a community center for people in need, for five decades. She organized its fund-raising benefits until 1969.         International House named her its first director of hospitality in 1952.  She was married in 1933 to Francis Adams Truslow, who became the first full-time president of the New York Curb Exchange, now the American Stock Exchange. He died in 1951. Her second husband, Dr. John Taylor Howell Jr., died in 1977.         She is survived by three sons, Francis Adams Truslow Jr. of West Newton, Mass.; Frederic Jennings Truslow of Washington, and John Taylor Howell 3d of Washington Crossing; two daughters, Elizabeth Truslow Russell of Cold Spring Harbor, and Sophia Day LaVerdiere Truslow of Brooklyn; a stepdaughter, Shirley Howell Caracciolo of Rome; a sister, Laura Jennings Ingraham of Hanover, N.H.; 13 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Halle, a glamorous Cleveland department store heiress who cut a heady swath through the 20th century firmament, befriending and bewitching luminaries on both sides of the Atlantic and serving as a perceptive gadfly in politics, society and the arts, died on Aug. 7 at her home in Washington. She was 93.         During a remarkable life in which she formed enduring intimate relationships with George Gershwin, Randolph Churchill, W. Averell Harriman, Joseph P. Kennedy, Walter Lippmann, Buckminster Fuller and scores of other diverse figures, Miss Halle demonstrated such a flair for friendship and a knack for bringing people together that it is a wonder she found time for anything else.         She had a creditable enough career in journalism and with American intelligence in World War II. But Miss Halle, who wrote for The Cleveland Plain Dealer and other publications, conducted radio interviews with public figures and provided intermission commentary for Cleveland Orchestra broadcasts, was at her best in private settings.         A tall, slender, blonde beauty who kept her youthful good looks well beyond middle age and whose infectious enthusiasm continued long after that, Miss Halle (pronounced HAL-ee) once showed a friend a list of 64 men who had proposed to her, among them a youthful Randolph Churchill and an aging Averell Harriman.         (For all her reputation as a femme fatale, the ''Mata Halle'' nickname that William J. Donovan pinned on her during her years with his wartime Office of Strategic Services was more pun than analogy to the World War I seductress.)         Given the range and ardor of her admirers, one of Miss Halle's more notable achievements may have been avoiding marriage and thriving in an era when even independently wealthy spinsters were viewed with suspicion.         Seeking safety in numbers, she became famous for surprising wealthy suitors by showing up for dinner dates with several less well-heeled admirers in tow.         Even more notable was the fact that she remained on such good terms with her spurned suitors. Thirty years and two marriages after he was first rejected, for example, Mr. Churchill was still as devoted to her as ever.         That was partly because Miss Halle was such an attentive listener that she could repeat entire conversations verbatim, making her a reliable and entertaining gossip.         For all that, she had such a passion for discretion that long after most of her paramours were dead, including those who had not been free to propose marriage, she refused all entreaties to write her memoirs. Even intimates who are certain, for example, that she had been Joseph Kennedy's favorite mistress cannot say for sure whether her friendship with Gershwin, who wrote her gushing letters, had been a full-fledged romance.         A product of a fairy-tale union between a wealthy German-Jewish merchant and an Irish-Catholic working girl, Miss Halle, whose father was a founder of the old Halle Brothers department store in Cleveland, grew up in an ecumenical, intellectually charged atmosphere that left her without prejudice or pretension and with an eclectic range of interests, especially in people.         Her survivors include a sister, Ann Little of Chagrin Falls, Ohio.         Making the most of her family connections and even more of those she formed on her own, Miss Halle got her start in political society early. During a family visit to Washington when she was 13, President Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, a former Cleveland mayor, had a young assistant, Walter Lippmann, show her around. He got her admitted to a special session of Congress, making her perhaps the last person alive to have witnessed Wilson's request for a declaration of war in April 1917.         Later, after one boring year at Smith College, Miss Halle took New York by storm, captivating Gershwin and making her apartment a headquarters of the roaring 20's.         She broadened her scope considerably after Randolph Churchill gave a speech in Cleveland in 1931 and fell in love with her. Although Miss Halle, who was eight years older than he was, kept him at bay, she became a frequent visitor to Chartwell, the Churchill country home in England, and a favorite of his father, Sir Winston Churchill.         As a result, Miss Halle, who was an old friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt and campaigned for him in 1932, became one of the few people to be on intimate family terms with the two wartime leaders.         Miss Halle, who made Washington her base after World War II, became such a Churchill enthusiast that she published two volumes of his collected sayings and was credited with using her considerable drawing room influence to persuade Congress to confer the honorary American citizenship that he considered his most prized public tribute.       
         Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.         Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996.         ''My time, obviously, is not quite here,'' she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.         And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, ''Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian.''         In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.         She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. ''I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time,'' she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.         Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.         In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.         Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.         ''The doctor called me every name in the book,'' Mrs. Good recalled later.         But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.         After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. ''I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have,'' she said.         A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.         In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.         Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.       
         Ruth Adler, who kept the staff of The New York Times informed about its own milestones and behind-the-scenes adventures and shaped the legends and lore of The Times for other journalists and students for 33 years as editor of the newspaper's in-house journal Times Talk, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Adler, who underwent open heart surgery in March, died of heart failure, her nephew, Peter Lewis, said.         Behind every news story there is an untold -- or rarely told -- tale of the reporter's personal experience: the hazards of covering a war or a riot, the grind of the campaign trail, a correspondent's travails with foul weather, bad food, crazy hours, unworkable communications and implausible expense accounts.         From 1947, when she became the first editor of Times Talk, to 1980, when she retired after 46 years with The Times, Ms. Adler chronicled these tales, and countless more routine doings, for the newspaper's 5,000 employees in a house organ that was one of the best and most widely read periodicals on the practice of journalism.         More than a compendium of staff marriages, births, deaths and achievements, it captured the life of the newspaper from the inside, with sometimes dramatic, often hilarious accounts from reporters around the world, from editors in a raucous city room, from printers riding Linotype machines, and hard men in square paper hats down in a thundering pressroom on 43d Street in Manhattan.         Reflecting its editor's fascination with the news and with the newspaper's daily production, her journal offered Tom Wicker's account of covering the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas; A. M. Rosenthal on his expulsion from Poland for reports that won a Pulitzer Prize; Claude Sitton on civil rights clashes in the South, and Robert Lipsyte on how to report a boxing match with a screaming fan standing on your typewriter. Such accounts were all the more intriguing in an era when most reporters were anonymous figures behind their news articles.         In 1966, Ms. Adler compiled 53 Times Talk articles in ''The Working Press: Special to The New York Times,'' published by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Eliot Fremont-Smith, in a review for The Times, said the book conveyed ''a remarkably clear picture of how The Times, as an entity, works -- how the news comes in and what happens to it, in both routine and crisis situations.''         Ms. Adler also wrote ''A Day in the Life of The New York Times'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1971), a 242-page account, hour by hour, of what the newspaper's staff did to put out the issue of Feb. 28, 1969, a date chosen arbitrarily, on which there was no earth-shaking news.         Based on memos from hundreds of Times employees, her account detailed the activities of reporters around the world and across the nation, looked over the shoulders of rewritemen pounding out inserts and of editors writing headlines and laying out pages, eavesdropped on advertising salesmen and then watched the presses roll and the delivery trucks roar away.         Ruth Adler was born in Rochester  on July 10, 1910, the daughter of Ida Lichtenstein and Mortimer Adler. She attended public schools in Rochester, graduated from Smith College and attended the Sorbonne in Paris for a year before joining The Times in 1934 as a secretary to Ivan Veit, then the promotion manager. She was not a member of the Adler family that is related to the Sulzbergers who own The Times.         Ms. Adler, who never married, played golf and tennis and was an extensive traveler.         She occasionally wrote articles for The Times's Sunday magazine or travel section. In 1947, she was asked to establish an internal news publication for the staff. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, was one of her principal fans and consultants; he gave her a small staff and complete autonomy to design, edit and produce Times Talk.         During her early tenure, Times Talk was 12 pages and appeared monthly. Later, the number of pages varied in a larger format, and it appeared 10 times a year. Its circulation went beyond The Times staff, to other journalists and to journalism schools, where many regarded it as a valuable teaching aid. Today, Times Talk has 28 pages, appears seven times a year and has a circulation of more than 8,500 current and retired employees of the newspaper.         When Ms. Adler retired in 1980, a full issue of Times Talk was devoted to her. The art critic John Canaday called her ''a living encyclopedia'' of the newspaper's recent history, and Russell Baker, the columnist, offered a tongue-in-cheek tribute to one of his favorite editors.         ''Some of the best people had worked for The Times for years before Times Talk revealed that they were actually first-rate reporters,'' he wrote. ''At a time when your material was usually reduced to chopped liver by The Times's famous editing process, the opportunity to tell the story right in Times Talk compensated for many a night when you stalked out of the office in a rage to tell it to the gin bottle.''       
         The death at 36 of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris brought to a tragic close the life of a woman who had gone from being a shy young society girl to one of the world's most glamorous women.         Her marriage to Prince Charles, heir to the British throne and 12 years her senior, on July 29, 1981, was one of those events that people remember as a timepost in their own lives, a moment of old fashioned romance and royal splendor seldom seen in this century. Fifteen million people in Britain alone watched it on television.         The unraveling of that marriage was just as public, with the extraordinary occurrence of candid television interviews by the two partners about their separate adulteries and the descent of the young Princess into eating disorders and suicide attempts.         Though the marriage ended officially with their divorce a year ago Aug. 28, the rivalry for public attention and approval continued until her death. This year the Princess had taken highly publicized trips to former war zones like Angola to conduct her high-profile campaign against landmines, and had in recent weeks posed knowingly on Mediterranean holidays with her friend, Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, 42, in an apparent effort to show the world that the once troubled young woman had found personal happiness.         Prince Charles, for his part, held the first photo calls at his vacation home in Balmoral since the early days of his marriage, appearing with the couple's two sons, William, 15, the next heir to the throne, and Harry, 13. It was a competition conducted by photo opportunity, and in the Princess's case turned a liability she often complained about, the constant attention of paparazzi, into an asset.         Lady Diana Spencer was born on July 1, 1961, Sandringham, Norfolk, and was only 19 years old when Charles proposed. Her son William was born in June, 1982, providing promised continuity to the crown and making her the mother of a king-to-be.         By 1986 the first press stories about cracks in the marriage appeared, at a time, a biography of the Princess has said, when Charles had resumed his relationship with his married friend Camilla Parker Bowles.         That biography ''Diana: Her True Story,'' by Andrew Morton, said she then started dating a cavalry officer, James Hewitt, conducting an affair that lasted four years and which she later said had hurt her.         The royal couple had few common interests. Charles loved horses, his garden and traditional architecture; she loved buying clothes, listening to pop music on her Walkman and gossiping on the telephone.         Once a girl in frilly modest-maiden dresses and a modified bowl haircut, she had become a fashionplate with annual expenses of more than $1.2 million, a woman whose every style change influenced the way women around the well dressed world appeared. Just this past June, 80 of her dresses were auctioned off for charity at Christie's in New York, promoted in a lavish catalogue shot by Lord Snowden, the former husband of Princess Margaret.         The couple separated in 1992, and in November 1995, Diana gave her explosive interview to the BBC confessing her own adultery, her anger at the palace and her feeling that Charles would not be a good King. It became widely reported that her wish was that Charles renounce his right to the crown, passing it on to their son William, known to the British public as Wills.         In the divorce she had to give up the honorific Her Royal Highness, the title that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats, but was able to keep the title Princess of Wales. She obtained lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600,000 a year to maintain her offices. She also got the right to keep her five-bedroom, four-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace.       
         Anna Balakian, former chairman of the department of comparative literature at New York University and an internationally recognized scholar in the fields of Symbolism and Surrealism, died on Tuesday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 82 and lived in Old Westbury, N.Y.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Suzanne Nalbantian Reynolds.         A dynamic woman who said she had ''never been able to draw a line between work and pleasure,'' Dr. Balakian was an early developer of the  discipline of comparative literature. Proficient in French, German, Spanish and Armenian, she was a prolific author of scholarly essays and wrote several books in her field, among them ''The Literary Origins of Surrealism'' (1947), a study of the founders of modern French poetry, and ''Surrealism: The Road to the Absolute'' (1959), an exposition of Surrealist literature and art.         With her sister, Nona Balakian, a literary critic and an editor at The New York Times Book Review, she was part of a literary circle that included the playwright William Saroyan and the diarist Anais Nin. Nona Balakian died in 1991.         Anna Balakian was also interested in the problems of education, and at her death had completed a wide-ranging critique -- still in manuscript -- of its status in the United States. In 1994 she published ''The Snowflake on the Belfry: Dogma and Disquietude in the Critical Arena,'' a consideration of contemporary literary criticism and its warring factions.         She was born in Constantinople, now Istanbul, in 1915 to Armenian parents, moved with her family to Germany as a child and later lived on the Swiss-French border before coming to the United States at the age of 11.         She spoke and wrote in recent years against what she saw as tendencies toward separatism and divisiveness in a multicultural America. A prominent theme in these articles was ''the vast international connections and kinships'' that she viewed as binding together people of different nationalities.         Dr. Balakian earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter College in 1936 and  master's and Ph.D. degrees at Columbia University in 1938 and 1943. While in graduate school, she taught French literature and language full time at Hunter College High School. Toward the end of World War II, she was appointed instructor and then assistant professor of French at Syracuse University. An accomplished violinist, she also played in the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra.         She was married in 1945 to Stepan Nalbantian, a fellow violinist and an electrical engineer, who died in 1984. Throughout her life, she retained her maiden name.         In 1953, Dr. Balakian began her career at New York University as an instructor in French, eventually moving into the field of comparative literature. As a full professor, she was chairman of the department from 1977 to 1985, when she retired as professor emerita. She was also president of the American Comparative Literature Association from 1977 to 1980 and was active in the International Comparative Literature Association.         Besides her daughter, of Old Westbury and Sagaponack, N.Y., Dr. Balakian is survived by a son, Haig Nalbantian of New York City, and a granddaughter.       
         Helen Merrill, a strong-willed and influential theatrical agent who advanced the careers of many of the most imaginative playwrights, directors and designers in the American theater, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said Patrick Herold, who is a partner in her agency.         Ms. Merrill's strength was in finding and encouraging venturesome young artists. As an agent, she played an important role in the lives of the playwrights Christopher Durang, Albert Innaurato, Richard Greenberg, Paul Rudnick and David Henry Hwang, among others. The designers she represented included Ming Cho Lee, George Tsypin, Tony Straiges, Paul Gallo and William Ivey Long, and among her directors were Anne Bogart, Jerry Zaks, Christopher Ashley, Michael Greif and Lisa Peterson.         Not all these people remained her clients, but they generally continued to feel a great indebtedness. Mr. Greenberg, who subsequently moved on to another agency, said: ''Helen ushered in a generation of playwrights. She was tremendously important to the life of the New York theater.''         Outspoken and demanding, she was known for her unassailable belief in her clients, whom she would support economically as well as artistically, often lending them money, while urging them to challenge themselves.         Although she lived in New York City for almost 60 years, she never lost her heavy German accent, which became a distinguishing feature of her personality, along with her wry and often prankish sense of humor. Her clients affectionately imitated her accent and mannerisms.         Mr. Rudnick used her as the model for the actor's agent played by Celeste Holm in his play ''I Hate Hamlet.'' He said: ''She was known for her independence, her passionate devotion to theater and her carefully honed mystique. She loved to discover and nurture talent with a trademark combination of toughness and glee.''         While other agents might sit in offices waiting for scripts, Ms. Merrill was indefatigable in her search for new plays. Dressed in her characteristic uniform (Brooks Brothers striped button-down shirt, Gap khakis and tennis shoes, and, in winter, a full-length mink coat), she was a familiar figure on the outposts of Off Off Broadway, always on the alert for emerging artists.         In the case of Mr. Durang, she first saw his work at the Yale Repertory Theater, where he and Mr. Innaurato collaborated on the satiric musical ''The Idiot's Karamazov.'' Soon she was trekking to see Mr. Durang's comedies in late-night performances at small Manhattan theaters. Later, as his agent, she was instrumental in enlisting three regional theaters to offer sequential productions of his play ''A History of the American Film'' and then shepherded it to Broadway.         ''She was the opposite of the cliches about agents,'' Mr. Durang said. ''If you had an offer of a lot of money or a workshop at Playwrights Horizons, she would much prefer that you did the workshop.''         About her taste, he said, ''She liked plays on the edge, and would get restless with old-fashioned playwrights.''         Most of her writers were several generations younger than she was. Many became her friends, though even for them she retained an air of mystery. ''I thought she led many other lives and was opaque about telling us about them,'' Mr. Durang said. There had been a brief marriage, and there was her intense relationship with Anthony Perkins, with whom she shared a home for many years.         Her representation of scenic, costume, lighting and sound designers added an entirely new dimension to her career.         ''She was a major person in representing designers,'' said Ming Cho Lee. ''We all went to Helen.''         After Mr. Lee joined her agency, many of his design students at the Yale Graduate School of Drama followed. Immersing herself in the world of design, she became an indispensable ally to Mr. Lee and others.         ''Her ideas never aged,'' Mr. Lee said. ''She was opinionated, but her opinions mattered. She could discriminate between fashion and something with a real core. In terms of the art of theater, we don't have anyone else.''         Ms. Merrill was born in Cologne, Germany, and came to the United States in 1939 with her parents and sister. She is survived by her sister, Anjelica Wender of Manhattan, and her brother, Hervey, of Rochester.         Although Ms. Merrill was primarily known as an agent, it was actually her third career. Earlier she had been a theatrical photographer. Then, with the backing of Mr. Perkins, she ran the Osgood Gallery in Manhattan. When the art gallery failed, she reinvented herself as an agent. In 1973, she opened Helen Merrill Ltd., specializing in playwrights and designers while also continuing to represent literary clients.         ''She was perhaps the first play agent to realize the importance of the new nonprofit theater movement,'' said Andre Bishop, co-director of Lincoln Center Theater, and before that the head of Playwrights Horizons. ''She saw the future before others did, and she saw no difference between a 12-performance showcase and Broadway.''         Mr. Bishop said that for a single play at Playwrights Horizons, Ms. Merrill would sometimes represent the playwright, the director and all three designers. ''It could have been called Helen Merrill Horizons in those days,'' he said.       
         Jean Westwood, who was a leader of George McGovern's disastrous Democratic campaign for President in 1972 and was the first woman to be chairman of a major political party, died on Monday in American Fork Hospital in American Fork, Utah, where she had lived for the last two years. She was 73.         The cause was complications from a pituitary tumor, said her husband, Richard E. Westwood.         Mrs. Westwood was an enthusiastic supporter of Democratic candidates and Democratic causes. But her period of leadership came during a time of Republican victories. So the unenvious task of trying to put a brave face on the McGovern campaign fell to Mrs. Westwood, who became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee after Mr. McGovern won the Democratic nomination.         ''It is pompous nonsense for anyone to presume to predict the result of an election seven weeks hence,'' she said in September 1972 as Mr. McGovern badly trailed President Richard M. Nixon. ''And it is ridiculous for any observer to conclude now that the whole thing is decided and the campaign is all over.''         But the whole thing was decided and the campaign was all over. Mr. McGovern carried only the Democratic bastions of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. He was not the only loser. Mrs. Westwood faced  her share of the blame for the rout and, three weeks after the election, found herself combating suggestions that she resign.         ''I will not quit,'' she declared. But by December, she was gone after just five months as party chairman, whose title she preferred over chairwoman (''It's not something I'm going to fret about,'' Mrs. Westwood said when she got the job.)         Mr. McGovern, reached today at his vacation home in Montana, remembered Mrs. Westwood as ''a person who combined a tough mind with a warm heart.'' As an example, he offered a description of how he reached the decision to drop Senator Thomas F. Eagleton as his Vice-Presidential running mate.         Mr. Eagleton had revealed that he was hospitalized for ''fatigue and nervous exhaustion'' three times and underwent electric shock treatments for depression, almost derailing an already stumbling Presidential campaign.         Mr. McGovern said: ''I was calling key people in the campaign to decide what to do, and I can remember almost her exact words. She said, 'It's painful for me to do anything that might hurt Senator Eagleton, but if his staying on the ticket endangers our election chances, that hurts all the millions of people we want to serve, so I think he should step down.' That showed her compassion and tough-mindedness.''         Mr. McGovern later settled on Sargent Shriver as a running mate.         In 1968, Mrs. Westwood worked for the Presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York and, after his assassination, turned to Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, another loser to Mr. Nixon.         In 1975, she helped lead the Presidential campaign of Terry Sanford, then the president of Duke University, and in 1985 she played a similar role for Bruce Babbitt. She lived in Arizona from 1976 to 1995 and served as an adviser to Mr. Babbitt when he was the Governor.         The success that eluded Mrs. Westwood in politics came to her in business. In their home state, Utah, she and her husband simultaneously ran businesses that raised minks, built apartments and installed swimming pools.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Westwood is survived by a son, Richard E. Westwood Jr., of Highland, Utah; a daughter, Beth Davies of American Fork; two brothers, John K. Miles of Provo, Utah, and David H. Miles of Orem, Utah; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Weinberger, a lifelong advocate for the rights of people with muscular dystrophy, died on Sept. 8 at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 89 and had lived in Long Beach, N.Y.         Mrs. Weinberger had been hospitalized since June, when a coronary infection was diagnosed, a niece, Susan Dick of West Long Branch, N.J., said. Mrs. Weinberger died of bone marrow failure, Ms. Dick said.         Mrs. Weinberger became involved in the rights of the disabled after doctors told her that her adopted son, Richard, 2, had muscular dystrophy.         Richard had to use a wheelchair by the age of 5 and died, at 17, in 1959.         She rallied for the rights of people with physical and mental disabilities to live in their own homes instead of  institutions.         Along with her husband, Arnold, she was a founding member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the national organization best known for fund-raising telethons with its chairman, Jerry Lewis, as host.         She set up a foundation named after her son and was among the founders of Independent Living for the Handicapped, a Brooklyn-based advocacy group that helps the severely disabled to live in their own homes.         Mrs. Weinberger, a native of Manhattan, lived in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, for most of her life until 1975, when she moved to Long Beach.         Her husband died in 1983. She is survived by her sister, Frances Fenig of Miami Beach, Fla.       
         Shirley Clarke, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, a champion of independent filmmaking and a missionary for video as a force in communications, died on Tuesday at the Palliative Care Center of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. She was 77 and lived in Carlisle, Mass.         Her sister Elaine Dundy, the novelist and biographer, said Miss Clarke entered the center, a hospice, after a stroke two weeks ago. She also suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         As a filmmaker, Miss Clarke was probably best known for the three pictures she made between 1960 and 1963. ''The Connection,'' filmed in cinema verite style in 1960 and taken from Jack Gelber's Off Broadway play, was a frank study of drug addiction that was banned on grounds of obscenity by the motion picture division of the New York State Board of Regents.         Her 1962 documentary, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' a portrait of the poet, won an Oscar.         Her gritty 1963 film, ''The Cool World,'' adapted from a novel by Warren Miller and filmed on the streets of Harlem, tracked the life of a young man who rises briefly to the leadership of a juvenile gang.         ''Right now,'' Miss Clarke said in 1962, ''I'm revolting against the conventions of movies. Who says a film has to cost a million dollars and be safe and innocuous enough to satisfy every 12-year-old in America?''         In 1962 Miss Clarke and the filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas founded the Film-Makers Cooperative, a nonprofit company for the distribution of independent films.         ''There must be 40 or 50 others like me in the country, with a desire for self-expression and no urge to move to Hollywood and make soap opera,'' Miss Clarke said.         ''We're creating a movie equivalent of Off Broadway, fresh and experimental and personal. The lovely thing is that I'm alive at just the time when I can do this.''         In 1967, Miss Clarke attracted attention with the release of ''Portrait of Jason,'' filmed during a single 12-hour session in her Manhattan apartment. The documentary, shown at the New York Film Festival, was a 105-minute interview with a gay black male prostitute.         ''The result, I'm convinced, is a portrait of a guy who is both a genius and a bore,'' she said.         By the 1970's, Miss Clarke was turning to video. ''Videotape is going to teach Americans to play with each other,'' she said then. ''The fight of the 1980's will be the battle for access to communications media.''         Released in 1986, her final movie, ''Ornette: Made in America,'' a portrait of the great modern jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, mixed film and video.         From 1975 to 1983, Miss Clarke was a professor of film at the University of California at Los Angeles.         She came to her life in film and video after a career in dance. Her concern with movement led her to motion pictures, and among her earliest films were dance-related shorts. ''I became more interested in people than abstractions,'' she said.         Reared in Manhattan and educated at the Lincoln School, Miss Clarke was the eldest of three daughters of the former Florence Rosenberg and Samuel N. Brimberg, a wealthy manufacturer.         ''Daddy was of the school which felt that men didn't talk about important matters to women,'' Miss Clarke once said. ''I guess I always had an enormous need to show him I wasn't the dope he thought I was.''         She said she attended seven different colleges without graduating. ''I studied anything as long as I could keep on dancing,'' she said.         For several years, she studied and danced with Martha Graham and Hanya Holm and was 17 when she offered her first work as a choreographer.         Her marriage in 1943 to Bert Clarke ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Dundy, who lives in Los Angeles, she is survived by another sister, Betty Lorwin of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Wendy, a video artist who also lives in Los Angeles.         As Miss Clarke lay dying, she was visited in her hospital room by her daughter and a group of friends, all film and video makers, who sipped Champagne as they reminisced about her and her work and how it paved the way for the MTV generation.         The next day, Ms. Dundy described the gathering to their sister Betty, who replied, ''It's so like a film Shirley would make.''         Correction:  September 29, 1997, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the filmmaker Shirley Clarke referred imprecisely to a documentary she directed. The film, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' won an Academy Award in 1963 not for her but for its producer, Robert Hughes.       
         Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the poorest of the world's poor, died yesterday in Calcutta, India, where she had lived since her work with the destitute began five decades ago. She was 87.         Mother Teresa was hospitalized several times last year with heart, lung, kidney and other problems, and also suffered ill health in earlier years. Her physician in Rome, Vincenzo Bilotta, said she suffered cardiac arrest during the evening at her convent in Calcutta, The Associated Press reported.         As her health deteriorated over the past year, Mother Teresa stepped aside and her order, the Missionaries of Charity, chose a new leader, Sister Nirmala, in March.         Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in what is now Macedonia, was revered in India, where she worked for 68 years and became a citizen.         She also came to be honored around the world for the compassionate, effective way she set up and oversaw projects to provide care and comfort to the very poor and the very sick, orphans, lepers and the dying.         Traveling widely even in her later years, she became known to millions as a slight, brown-eyed figure -- she was only 5 feet tall -- smiling and dressed in the plain white sari with blue trim of her order.         Her work was considered by some a rebuke to widespread feelings of personal powerlessness in middle-class and wealthy societies. In 1968, Pope Paul VI praised her as an ''intrepid messenger of the love of Christ.''         The Nobel Committee said its award to her in 1979 was ''for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress in the world, which also constitute a threat to peace.'' Informed of the honor, she said simply, ''I am unworthy.''         But she came in for criticism, too. A British television documentary in 1994 contended that perceptions of her were colored by ''hyperbole and credulity.''         Mother Teresa, who had been a school administrator in a suburb of Calcutta, began working in the slums of that poverty-ridden and densely populated city in 1948. She had received what she described as a divine ''call within a call'' two years earlier while riding on a train. ''The message was quite clear,'' she recalled. ''I was to help the poor while living among them. It was an order.''         In 1950 she established the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, becoming its Superior General. She went on to organize far-flung programs for the impoverished, eventually reaching more than 90 countries.         Her chief task, as she defined it, was to provide ''free service to the poor and the unwanted, irrespective of caste, creed, nationality or race.''         In predominantly Hindu India, she made sure that the priests of her order gave last rites, the Roman Catholic sacrament for the dying, only on request, and that they dealt with the dead according to the practices of the individual's own religion. For the living, Mother Teresa set up orphanages, schools in slums and Pure Heart Homes for sick and dying homeless people.         Over the years, her work expanded. She set up mobile health clinics, centers for the malnourished, rehabilitation hospices for lepers, homes for alcoholics and drug addicts, and shelters for the homeless. Her centers in the United States included the Gift of Love Hospice for 15 men with AIDS, at 657 Washington Street, in Greenwich Village.         The number of sisters in her religious order, only 62 in 1957, grew enormously. By the time Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize, her order had attracted 1,800 nuns and 120,000 lay workers, running more than 80 centers in India and more than 100 others in other parts of the world. The order's patients included 53,000 lepers.         By 1988, her order was operating 600 mobile health clinics where almost four million people received treatment. That year Mother Teresa visited South Africa, which was still under apartheid rule, to set up a hostel in a black township. By early 1992, experts on Catholic welfare work reported, members of her order -- 4,000 nuns and novices, 400 priests and brothers and hundreds of thousands of lay volunteers -- worked at 450 sites worldwide, including in Albania and Iraq.         Aid and Tribute, But No Pity         Mother Teresa often paid tribute to the stricken people she cared for. Speaking to a gathering at the United Nations in 1975, she recalled a woman she had found dying on a Calcutta street.         ''I knew she was dying,'' she said softly. ''After I did what I could, she took my hand, gave me a beautiful smile and thanked me. She gave me more than I gave her.''         Mother Teresa put particular emphasis on giving the deprived and the sick a sensation of dignity through personal contact. ''Ours is a humble service,'' she said in an interview in 1975. ''We try to remain right down on the ground.''         But she said pity did not help the poor. They ''don't need pity, they need love and compassion,'' she once said, adding, ''If you don't know them, you don't love them and don't serve them.''         She said some people used to advise her that her order should have fans in some rooms used by its nuns. ''I do not want them to have fans,'' she continued. ''The poor whom they are to serve have no fans. Most of the girls come from village homes where they had no fans. They should not be more comfortable here than at home.''         In addition to piety, humility and warmth, she displayed strength of will, blunt practicality and organizational talent. The Nobel Committee said it meant to honor her as much for her managerial skills as for her devotion to the poor.         Mother Teresa earned her Nobel Prize despite a political climate in India that was unfavorable to foreign missionaries. In the 1970's the Government took measures to discourage such work, and by the time she won the prize the number of missionaries in India had shrunk to only a few hundred. It had formerly been 6,000. In 1979 there were about 15 million Christians in the country, 2.4 percent of the population of 630 million.         On certain social questions, Mother Teresa adhered outspokenly to the doctrine of her church. She voiced strong opposition to contraception, abortion and divorce.         In accepting the Nobel Prize, she declared: ''To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations. The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.''         Strong Adherence To Church Doctrine         In 1995, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, she helped dedicate a shelter in Washington for women and newborn infants. The center was meant to discourage abortions by providing quarters for children waiting to be adopted or put in foster homes.         And in February 1996, Senator Bob Dole, campaigning in Iowa for the Republican Presidential nomination, declared that Mother Teresa had called to praise him for helping pass a ban against certain types of late-term abortions.         In 1995, before a referendum in Ireland was narrowly passed to end a constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, opponents of the law were exasperated when a hand-written letter from Mother Teresa urging a ''no'' vote was made public.         On another occasion, she contended in effect that women's place was in the home, ''allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.''         Criticism of her came from various quarters. In an interview in 1995 in Calcutta, Debasis Bhattachariya of the Indian Science and Rationalists Association declared, ''Mother Teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen, because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society.''         Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation, voiced particularly strong criticism of her in a 1995 book, ''The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice'' (Verso). Mr.  Hitchens contended that she had ''furnished P.R.-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen.'' Her success, he said, ''depends on the exploitation of the simple and the humble by the cunning and the single-minded.''         The Philadelphia Inquirer's review of the book carried the headline, ''A Salvo of Cheap Shots Fired at a Contemporary Saint.''         The 1994 British television documentary that criticized Mother Teresa, titled ''Hell's Angel,'' was also written by Mr. Hitchens. Asked about the documentary, Mother Teresa said simply, ''Forgive them for they know not what they do.''         In the United States, her views were of such wide interest that ''The Simple Path,'' a book of her thoughts, experiences and beliefs compiled by Lucinda Vardey, was a best seller for 12 weeks in 1995 and 1996.         She was ''an incredible person,'' President Clinton said yesterday in Edgartown, Mass., where he was on vacation. The House of Representatives, observed a moment of silence.         Answering the Call To Become a Nun         Mother Teresa was born Agnes Bojaxhiu on either Aug. 26 or 27, 1910, to Albanian parents in Skopje, about 200 miles south of Belgrade. Studded with churches and mosques, the city is today the capital of Macedonia, but was then ruled by Ottoman Turks, before becoming part of Serbia in 1913.         Accounts have differed as to the profession of her father. An authorized biography of her that came out in Britain in 1992 said he was a building contractor. While a schoolgirl, she belonged to a Catholic lay women's group. At its meetings, letters were read from Balkan Jesuits who had gone as missionaries to Bengal, in eastern India.         At the age of 12 she first felt the desire to become a nun. At 18 she decided to do so and got in touch with the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish Catholic order with missions in Bengal. She joined the order in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin, in 1928. After English lessons there, she spent a more than a year in Darjeeling, north of Calcutta, where the order ran a girls' school.         She then became a teacher, mainly of geography and also of history and catechism, at St. Mary's High School, on the grounds of the Entally Convent outside Calcutta. Many of her pupils came from poor families. In time she learned Bengali and Hindi and became the school's principal.         It was while riding on a train on Sept. 10, 1946, that she received her ''call within a call,'' she said. She left her school and learned nursing skills from other nuns. Then she began her good works among Calcutta's poor, feeling uncertainties at first but also happiness as she set about meeting peoples' needs. ''I knew where I belonged,'' she recalled, ''but I did not know how to get there.''         Before long -- in 1950 -- she won canonical recognition for her new order, the Missionaries of Charity. The religious sisters who joined took vows of chastity, obedience, poverty and service.         One day in 1952, as her longtime associate Sister Agnes recalled years later, ''she found an old woman dying in the streets.''         ''We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital,'' Sister Agnes said, ''but before we could, she died. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.''         And so Mother Teresa set about establishing a home for the dying destitute. She persuaded Calcutta's municipal authorities to give her a shabby one-story building, which happened to stand next to a complex of Hindu shrines.         In that humble structure, she succeeded in creating a place where those who died would do so with dignity. The space was cleaned. The dying were cared for with compassion. The establishment was called Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart.         Mother Teresa's undertakings continued, one after another. There was a home for abandoned children, a leper colony and an old people's home. She went on to set up welfare institutions ranging from a family clinic, to mobile leprosy clinics, to nurseries for abandoned children.         A Strong Disdain For Mere Money         Her work brought in donations from admirers. She liked to say that money was ''really no problem, we depend on divine providence,'' and she said simply that her works were underwritten by ''cash and kind.''         She recalled that when her order opened a house in New York, ''Terence Cardinal Cooke was very anxious that he should give every month a maintenance for the sisters.''         ''I didn't want to hurt him,'' she said, ''but I didn't know how to explain to him that our services are purely for the love of God and that we cannot accept maintenance. I expressed it the only way I could: 'Your Eminence, I don't think God is going to become bankrupt in New York City!' ''         One longtime source of support was Catholic Relief Services, the overseas aid agency of the United States bishops, which operates in scores of countries. Its backing came largely in donations of United States Government surplus food.         In 1971 Mother Teresa's order opened its first house in the United States, in Harlem. It was soon moved to the Bronx, where, on a visit to the United States in 1980, Mother Teresa helped open a soup kitchen and declared her thanks to the poor people of New York ''for allowing themselves to be taken care of'' by her order. In 1981, she opened a mission in Newark.         Then in 1982, when she was 72, she worked for a number of days in Beirut, Lebanon, crisscrossing the Green Line that divided Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. She rescued dozens of mentally ill children from the dangers of warfare in the Muslim part of the city.         One of her biographers, Eileen Egan, reported in a 1985 book, ''Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa -- the Spirit and the Work,'' that a Red Cross official who helped her observed later: ''What stunned everyone was her energy. We didn't expect a saint to be so efficient.''         After suffering heart problems, Mother Teresa sent her resignation as head of her order to Pope John Paul II early in 1990. She said the time had come for ''younger hands.'' A new head was to be chosen that September. But when the time came she told reporters in Calcutta that God's will had kept her from stepping down. Catholic clergymen said she had been prevented from doing so when members of the order's electoral college, gathered from many countries, had been unable to agree on her successor. They re-elected her to her post.         Over the years, she received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees from universities ranging from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome to Harvard. She was awarded the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award. And she was an honorary citizen of Assisi, the hill town in central Italy where Francis of Assisi was born in 1182.         In addition to all her good works, Mother Teresa found time to compose prayers, including this one:         Make us worthy, Lord,         To serve our fellow men         Throughout the world who live and die         In poverty or hunger.         Give them, through our hands         This day their daily bread,         And by our understanding love,         Give peace and joy.         But she could also be briskly prosaic. In an interview in 1994 she said: ''I work all day. That is the best way.''       
         Eleanor Pepper, a former chairwoman of Pratt Institute's department of interior design who was a longtime design consultant and decorated an early version of the United Nations Security Council meeting room, died on Sunday at her apartment in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan. She was 93.         Miss Pepper was a professor of interior design at Pratt Institute from 1950 to 1970 and headed the interior design department there from 1951 to 1959. She was concurrently a New York-based design consultant for more than two decades, beginning in 1950.         From 1945 to 1950, she was with the New York-based architectural firm of Voorhees, Walker, Foley, Smith doing interior design. It was in that capacity that, in 1946, she decorated the Security Council's new main meeting room. The space had formerly been a Hunter College gymnasium.         The Voorhees firm designed the new chamber, which was decorated in soothing shades of soft tan and buff, with off-color brown carpeting.         Miss Pepper was a Manhattan native and graduated in 1924 from Barnard College and received a B.S. in architecture in 1928 from Massachusetts Institute of Architecture and a Diplome des Etudes Superieures in 1933 from the Sorbonne.         Her work in the 1930's included collaborating on plans for new newsreel theaters in Paris and for remodeling brownstone houses on Manhattan's East Side.         Early in her career she was also an associate editor of House and Garden magazine, and for several years she headed the department of interior design at Stephens College in Missouri.         During World War II, Miss Pepper worked on the design of floating drydocks for Admiral Harris Engineers and then was on the architectural staff of the U.S.O.         She was a longtime associate member of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. In 1948, while she was chairwoman of the chapter's subcommittee on exhibitions, she oversaw the installation of an exhibit titled ''Tomorrow's World,'' sponsored by the chapter, in the New York Museum of Science and Industry in Rockefeller Center.         The exhibit's main feature was a 30-foot-wide, three-dimensional panorama depicting an ideal, two-square-mile community for 20,000 people with such then-modern features as pedestrian overpasses at main thoroughfares, and garden apartment houses and office buildings, both built low to give residents a feeling of country living.         Miss Pepper also was a professor in the architecture department of the New York Institute of Technology, taught and lectured elsewhere and remained active as a teacher into her 80's.         She is survived by two nieces, Carol Cooper of Lyonsville, N.Y., and Alice Cooper of Jerusalem, and by three nephews, D. Stephen Pepper of Lynchburg, Va., and Rome, Michael Pepper of New Windsor, Md., and Sam Hellinger of Pacific Palisades, Calif.       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Esther G. Gottesman, whose service to the Jewish community spanned more than 60 years and who played an important role in the acquisition of the Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98 and had homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan.         Mrs. Gottesman's interest and appreciation of the historical importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls led her to recommend to her brother-in-law, D. Samuel Gottesman, that he finance their acquisition and donate them to Israel. The Shrine of the Book was later established at the Israel Museum to display the scrolls.         A lifelong Zionist, she was a delegate to the first postwar congress of the World Zionist Organization in Basel, Switzerland, in 1946. She was a member of the WZO Action Committee during the formative years of the State of Israel. A supporter of Jewish education, she was active in the Board of Jewish Education in New York for many years.         A national board member of Hadassah since 1934, Mrs. Gottesman held many positions in the organization, including vice president and treasurer. As a committee chairman, she advocated the idea that the group support the expansion of a vocational educational program from a small high school to a major college, the Hadassah College of Technology in Jerusalem. She donated the college's auditorium and gymnasium and raised funds for it.         She was also responsible for developing what had been a house newsletter into Hadassah Magazine, and she assembled and arranged publication of the book, ''Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People.''         Mrs. Gottesman was born in Manhattan in 1898, the daughter of Aaron and Sarah Garfunkel. She graduated from New York University in 1921 and married Benjamin Gottesman, a banker and investment manager, the same year. He died in 1979.         The couple's financial support of Yeshiva University resulted in the establishment of the Mendel Gottesman Library, named after Mr. Gottesman's father, the endowment of a chair in Library Sciences and creation of the Benjamin Gottesman Presidential Lecture Series. The family's involvement with the university covered 75 years.         She is survived by two sons, David S. Gottesman of Manhattan and Milton M. Gottesman of Washington; two brothers, Harold Garfunkel of Manhattan and Julian Garfunkel of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a sister, Florence Roswell of Manhattan; three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Rosemary R. Gunning, who led fights against school busing in New York City in the 1960's and went on to become one of the first female Assembly members, died on Saturday night at the home of a niece in Roslyn, N.Y. She was 92.         The cause was liver cancer, said a grandniece, Patricia Gunning.         Ms. Gunning was known for her strong speaking style, clear arguments and intense community involvement as she became a founder of the state Conservative Party and the first woman to run for citywide office, in 1965, for City Council President on a ticket headed by William F. Buckley Jr. in the mayoral slot.         Beginning in 1968, she served four terms in the Assembly, becoming the first Conservative to win state office.         She was a leader in organizing Housing Court in New York and was an outspoken proponent of landlords' rights.         But she often took unexpected positions, favoring the proposed equal rights amendment as she opposed abortion. But Ms. Gunning became known as a leader of the fight against forced busing, a battle that she never defined in terms of race, but always as an issue of neighborhood control.         The effort thrust her to the forefront of one of the most tumultuous bitter battles in the city's history, with frequent picketing and racial epithets. Almost one-quarter of the students in the city stayed out of school one day in a protest that Ms. Gunning helped organize.         ''Integration is a fine thing,'' she said at the time. ''From the beginning, one of the things we wanted was to have no racial disputes, no lining of whites up against Negroes.''         However, she was not a parent. ''If I had children, I wouldn't have time for all this,'' she said.         In those battles, Ms. Gunning, who was shorter than 5 feet and often needed platforms to reach the microphones in front of her, became known as Grandma Gunning, for her middle-class appearance and sometimes stern demeanor.         It was her clarity of mind that most impressed Mr. Buckley, he said, adding, ''What was special about her was her facility in taking complicated matters and putting them in very clear negotiable form.''         But others described her as a dangerous force in 1964, particularly her urgings to keep children out of school as a protest. The president of the Board of Education, James Donovan, called that reprehensible, saying the move was a ''conspiracy to destroy'' public education.         Ms. Gunning's allies strenuously argue that time has vindicated her position. ''History has proven her right,'' Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, said. ''Forced school busing ultimately ended up being a total failure in New York, ripping up neighborhood after neighborhood.''         Indeed, school busing was replaced by neighborhood control of schools and local school boards, a change that recently gave way to greater central control by the Board of Education.         Ms. Gunning was born in Brooklyn and moved to Queens at an early age. She entered the Brooklyn Law School directly from high school, one of the last students to do so. She was one of 10 women in a class of 600 and was admitted to the bar in 1930. After entering private practice, she later  worked 11 years as a private lawyer with the Army.         From her early youth until she died, she lived in the house in which her grandparents had lived, a white clapboard at 1867 Grove Street in Ridgewood, Queens. Her husband, Lester Moffett, had various jobs, including working as a guard at the 1964-65 World's Fair.         For all her accomplishments, people seem to remember her as the woman next door. Assemblyman Robert Werts, a Republican with whom she served, remembered an event at Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's estate to entertain legislators, recalling, ''I looked over, and she was hitting her husband over the head with a pocketbook to straighten him out.''         She worked as a private lawyer until she was 90, her grandniece said. She also continued to lobby on behalf of property owners, though she sometimes forgot to collect the $200-a-month rent that she charged a tenant for a room in her house. She also volunteered to help immigrants with  legal problems.         Surviving are a nephew, John, of Islip, N.Y.; 2 nieces, Marie and Ann, of Roslyn; 13 grandnieces and nephews, and a cousin, Sylvia Boyland of Fresh Meadows, Queens.       
         Annie Dodge Wauneka, who broke custom and became the Navajo Nation's first female legislator and a health crusader, died on Monday at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona. She was 87 and lived in Klagetoh, in northeast Arizona.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said Ted Rushton, a spokesman in Window Rock, Ariz., the Navajo capital.         For many years starting in the 1950's, Mrs. Wauneka traveled to villages and clinics, covering the 24,000-square-mile territory of the Navajo to preach public health standards. She cut a striking figure, tall and always wearing traditional Navajo clothing, including a colorful shawl and silver jewelry.         Over the years, she urged the Navajo to adopt more modern dwellings,  and she worked to improve the quality of water on the reservation. She also helped many people obtain medical attention after generations of reliance solely on tradition. She received much of the credit for defeating tuberculosis among the Navajo beginning in the 1950's and received national recognition for her role.         Albert A. Hale, president of the Navajo Nation, called her ''our legendary mother'' and ''the most honored Navajo in our history.'' He directed all public offices to shut down for one day last week, except for emergency services.         Annie Dodge was born in Deer Springs, Ariz., and learned of public service from her father, Henry Chee Dodge, a chief and first president of the Navajo Nation's legislative Tribal Council. Its jurisdiction stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. She became the first woman on the council in 1951, winning an election over two rival candidates. One of those was her husband, George L. Wauneka, with whom she ran a ranch owned by her father in Arizona.         Mrs. Wauneka was in the council for nearly 30 years, serving as the chairwoman of the health committee. Her concern with public health could be traced to her grade-school days, when the influenza pandemic at the end of World War I killed many Navajos. She escaped with a mild attack and, even as an 8-year-old, helped the overworked nurse at her school in Fort Defiance, Ariz.         Her formal education ended in the 11th grade, when she began tending to the needs of her tribe at the side of her father, who had become head of the Tribal Council and her political mentor. ''From my childhood,'' she said later, ''I have been aware of the problems of my tribe and have wanted to help make our people aware of them.''         Among her frustrations were the objections of tribal medicine makers to new ways. She conceded that the medicine makers performed much good work among the people, especially in family matters. But she said: ''The Navajo is caught in between. I must convince them to accept a mixture.''         In 1963, Mrs. Wauneka and 30 diplomats, educators, musicians, authors and a former Supreme Court justice received the newly created Presidential Medal of Freedom for service to their country. President John F. Kennedy established the honor on July 4, 1963; after his assassination, the medals were presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson.         Mrs. Wauneka's husband died in 1994. Her survivors include four daughters, Irma Bluehouse, Laurencita Cohoe, Georgia Ann Plummer and Sally S. Wauneka; five sons, Franklin, George L. Jr., Henry Chee, Norman and Timothy; a sister, Ann Shirley, and three brothers, Bernard, Sam and Walter Shirley.       
         Edna Flannery Kelly, the first woman to represent Brooklyn in Congress and an expert in foreign affairs and social policy, died on Sunday at the home of her daughter in Alexandria, Va. She was 91.         A lifelong New Yorker, she had moved to Alexandria in 1982 following a stroke. Mrs. Kelly, who had cancer, experienced another stroke shortly before her death, her daughter, Maura Patricia Kelly, said.         For many of her 19 years as a Democrat in the House of Representatives, from 1949 to 1968, Mrs. Kelly was the sole woman in the New York delegation. When she left office, a departure brought about by shifting demographics in the borough, she was the third-ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.         Mrs. Kelly joined Congress after winning a special election in 1949 to fill an unexpired term in the 10th Congressional District and she was re-elected nine times in landslide victories, later representing the 12th District. But after district lines were redrawn in 1968, she decided to challenge a strong incumbent, Emanuel Celler, in a different district and lost that race. Her reconfigured district sent Shirley Chisholm to Congress as Brooklyn's first black Representative.         Edna Flannery was born in East Hampton on Long Island. Following her graduation from Hunter College in 1928, she married Edward L. Kelly, a lawyer active in Democratic politics who was a justice in the city court system. Mrs. Kelly herself had no political agenda initially, but her husband was killed in a car accident in 1942 and she later said she became active to carry on in his tradition. Her first job was to breathe life into the moribund women's auxiliary of Brooklyn's Madison Democratic Club, a hub of party activity.         She later joined the county executive committee and took on the chore of research director for the Democrats in the State Legislature. In that position, she built the network that later assured her nomination for the vacant seat in 1949.         She quickly became an expert on the Soviet bloc, led fact-finding missions throughout the world and, as head of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, championed NATO and a strong Europe as a bulwark against international Communism. She also helped to write foreign-policy legislation that, among other things, created the Peace Corps.         Serving during the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, she sponsored measures to settle displaced people after World War II and refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. She helped create the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.         She advocated women's and social issues, drawing attention to inequities in pay, credit and tax policy, including what she considered inadequate deductions for child care. She helped increase the deductions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.         Mrs. Kelly was used to easy re-election in one of the city's most densely populated districts, encompassing all or part of Flatbush, Crown Heights, Kensington, Borough Park and Bedford-Stuyvesant. During her tenure, the district's ethnic composition changed markedly, leading state legislators to reapportion the borough to acknowledge Bedford-Stuyvesant's growing black constituency.         Unwilling to run against Ms. Chisholm, who soon became a leading candidate for that Congressional seat, Mrs. Kelly took on Representative Celler, the dean of the state's Congressional delegation. The race in the reconfigured 10th district pitted two party regulars against each other, and Mrs. Kelly, her power base gone, lost to Mr. Celler in the primary.         Besides her daughter, Mrs. Kelly is survived by a son, William E. 2d, of Spring Lake, N.J.; a sister, Katherine Duryea of Amityville, N.Y.; eight grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.       
         Annette Barbara Weiner, an anthropologist and former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 64 and also had a residence in Wolcott, Vt.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Weiner became widely known in her field in the 1970's, when she retraced the steps of Bronislav Malinovski in the Trobriand Islands of the southwest Pacific. She was the recipient of this year's Distinguished Service Award of the American Anthropological Society.         At her death she was the Kriser Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at N.Y.U. She had resigned the deanship last year because of her illness.         Malinovski had brought attention to the Trobriands -- a small group of volcanic islands in Papua New Guinea -- more than five decades earlier. Dr. Weiner complemented his pioneering studies of their indigenous people by showing the importance of women in structures of authority and social relationships.         She distilled her research in ''Women of Value, Men of Renown: New Perspectives in Trobriand Exchange'' (U. of Texas Press, 1976). Written originally as a doctoral thesis, it commanded rare attention.         Dr. Weiner's original name was Annette Cohen. She was born in Philadelphia, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 and received a doctorate from Bryn Mawr College in 1974. She joined the  N.Y.U. faculty in 1981 as a professor and chairman of the Department of Anthropology.         She was a founding member, director and past president of the Society for Cultural Anthropology.         Dr. Weiner's first two marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Dr. William E. Mitchell, a retired professor of anthropology at the University of Vermont; a daughter and son by her first marriage, Linda Hoffman Matisse of Groton, Mass., and Jon Winer of Owings Mills, Md.; two stepchildren, Edward Mitchell of Puerto Rico and Elizabeth Mitchell of New Zealand; three brothers, Robert Cohen of Flourtown, Pa., Fred Caine of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Richard Cohen of Upper Darby, Pa., and eight grandchildren.       
         Karen Hubert Allison, who with her husband, Len Allison, lived out every cook's fantasy of turning a home into a restaurant and later earned three stars for the establishment, Huberts, in Manhattan, died on Tuesday in Maui, Hawaii. She was 49 and had lived in Maui since 1995.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said Dr. Wayne Lavender, a family friend.         When the couple opened their restaurant on East 22d Street in Manhattan in 1981, American restaurants were still in the grip of French traditions. The best restaurants were those whose chefs were trained in other countries and were most comfortable with ingredients and techniques developed thousands of miles away. The Allisons were among the pioneers who advocated exploring America's own ingredients and traditions.         ''They keyed into this very new idea of new American cuisine, which was about finding good producers and good ingredients,'' said Peter Hoffman, who cooked at Huberts from 1981 to 1985 and now owns Savoy in SoHo.         Neither Mr. Allison nor Ms. Hubert Allison was a trained chef. In 1977, when the couple began serving meals in their Brooklyn home, their ambition was not to open a restaurant but to make a documentary about a neighborhood clothing store. Ms. Hubert and Mr. Allison, who married in 1984, needed to raise $10,000 for a new camera, and they hit on the idea of inviting their friends to buy weekend meals in their three-story house in Cobble Hill. Both Mr. Allison, an English teacher, and Ms. Hubert, a writer, did the cooking. Their plan worked so well that they not only raised the money but also decided to go into the restaurant business.         Their first restaurant, also called Huberts, opened in 1979 in a romantically ornate Victorian corner bar in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, where they quickly won critical acclaim. By 1981, demand for seats had overflowed the 12-table bar and they moved to 102 East 22d Street in Manhattan. There, with Ms. Hubert Allison in the dining room and Mr. Allison in the kitchen, Huberts became one of the signature New York restaurants of the 1980's, a time when New Yorkers were enthusiastically discovering the joys and social possibilities of fine wining and dining. It earned three stars in 1985 from Bryan Miller, the restaurant critic for The New York Times.         ''There were people coming from all over the globe who were either cooking there or sharing food thoughts, and you saw this riot of tastes and flavors settle down into this kind of signature cuisines,'' said Joshua Wesson, the wine writer and merchant who was the sommelier at Huberts from 1983 to 1986. ''Before there was a Greenmarket, there was Karen Hubert and Len Allison seeking out little growers and artisanal makers of cheese and bringing them down to this restaurant.''         Karen Hubert was born in New York City in 1948. She received a bachelor's degree from City College of New York, where she met Mr. Allison, and a master's degree in fine arts from Columbia University.         In 1987, the couple's daughter, Halley Cyd Marie Allison, was born, and in 1989 they had a son, Luke Edward Allison. In addition to her husband and children, Ms. Hubert Allison is survived by a stepson, Matthew Allison, 32, a record industry executive in Hong Kong.         After Halley's birth, Ms. Hubert Allison began to withdraw from the restaurant business. At the same time, the couple closed the 22d Street restaurant and opened a more expensive Huberts at Park Avenue and 63d Street. With four times the seating and three times the staff, it had less of the warmth and intimacy that characterized their earlier efforts. It, too, received three stars, but lasted only two years.         They tried to regain their touch in 1991 with Onda, a more modest restaurant serving a hybrid of Thai and Italian cuisines. It did not last long.         After that, the couple taught at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and then moved to Hawaii after Ms. Hubert Allison became ill in 1995. In Hawaii, she concentrated on writing. Her first novel, ''How I Gave My Heart to the Restaurant Business'' (Ecco Press), a roman a clef, was published earlier this year, and she completed a cookbook, ''The Vegetarian Compass,'' which is to be published by Little, Brown next spring.         Despite the couple's many achievements, one nagging detail always remained. Their documentary was never completed.       
         Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a major movie studio and who played a prominent role advancing other women to top jobs in Hollywood, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here. She was 51 and lived in Los Angeles.         Charles Roven, Ms. Steel's husband, a film producer, said Ms. Steel had been suffering from a malignant brain tumor.         ''When I got the call 21 months ago from the doctor about Dawn's condition,'' said Mr. Roven, ''I was told that 97 percent of the people who had this die within the first six months. It goes to show what spirit she had.''         Ms. Steel, who came to Hollywood in the 1970's to take a merchandising job at Paramount, rose quickly to become president of production at that studio, where she oversaw development of such films as ''Flashdance,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Top Gun,'' ''The Untouchables,'' ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''The Accused.'' She became the first woman to head a major studio when she held the top job at Columbia Studios from October 1987 until January 1991. During her reign, the studio's films included ''Awakenings,'' ''Flatliners,'' ''Ghostbusters 2'' and ''Casualties of War.''         Ms. Steel produced several movies in recent years, among them ''Cool Runnings,'' a highly successful comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team. She and Mr. Roven have produced ''Fallen,'' starring Denzel Washington, and ''City of Angels,'' with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, both to be released next year.         Ms. Steel's career and life were marked by a powerful, even outsize, personality that helped her succeed in a business dominated by men.  ''She was highly opinionated, extremely self-confident, had a fantastic sense of humor and was someone of enormous style and taste,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the partners of Dreamworks SKG, and an early mentor of Ms. Steel's at Paramount, along with Michael Eisner and Barry Diller. He added, ''Maybe under the facade she was scared and intimidated by it all, but I didn't see a scintilla of that.''         Nora Ephron, the writer, who was given her first directorial job by Ms. Steel, said: ''Dawn certainly wasn't the first woman to become powerful in Hollywood, but she was the first woman to understand that part of her responsibility was to make sure that eventually there were lots of other powerful women. She hired women as executives, women as producers and directors, women as marketing people.         ''The situation we have today, with a huge number of women in powerful positions, is largely because of Dawn Steel,'' said Ms. Ephron.         Ms. Steel was one of President Clinton's earliest supporters in Hollywood. In the last year, Mr. Clinton had phoned her several times, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ms. Steel at her home in the Coldwater Canyon area of Los Angeles.         Characteristically, Ms. Steel often laughed with friends when recalling her first meeting with Mr. Clinton.         ''You're not as bad as I thought you'd be,'' Mr. Clinton told her.         Ms. Steel's skill as an executive was sometimes overshadowed by a reputation for an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style. She was called Steel Dawn and the Tank. ''It hurt me deeply, this reputation as tough, hard, mean,'' she said in 1993, following the publication of her autobiography ''They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front.'' She added: ''It was very painful, it came from guys who wanted to kill me. In some ways I was curt because there's an unbelievable amount to accomplish in a day.''         ''Look, I'm not Mary Poppins,'' she said at another point, ''but I think I functioned with integrity.''         The films that Ms. Steel most enjoyed seeing and making -- such as ''Flashdance,'' about a female welder who wants to dance, and ''Cool Runnings'' -- were personal to her. These are stories of outsiders with outlandish ambitions who overcome numerous obstacles to get what they want. ''She had a formula for many of her movies that carried a simple truth: You want something, you work incredibly hard, you get it,'' said Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and a close friends.         Although Ms. Steel often said that she was just ''an ordinary middle-class girl from New York,'' the story of her life was far from ordinary and, like those of many other wealthy and successful moguls in Hollywood, self-invented.         She was born in the Bronx on Aug. 19, 1946, and grew up in Manhattan and ''in a crummy neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks'' in Great Neck, N.Y., according to her autobiography. Her father, Nat, was a zipper salesman to the military who had a nervous breakdown when she was a child; her mother, Lillian, was a formidable businesswoman compelled to work to support the family. (The family's name was originally Spielberg, but her father changed it to Steel to reflect his prowess as a semiprofessional weight lifter).         Ms. Steel ran out of money after a year at Boston University, and attended New York University's School of Commerce for two years, studying marketing. By 1968 Ms. Steel was working as a receptionist in the garment district and soon found a low-level marketing job at Penthouse magazine devising X-rated products. (She initially told her parents she was working at Mademoiselle.)         Answering phones at Penthouse, Ms. Steel noticed that amaryllis plants took on a phallic look just before blooming. As she recalled, she hired an artist to exaggerate the effect and wrote her own copy for the ad: ''Grow your own . . . All it takes is $6.98 and a lot of love.'' The plant was so popular that Penthouse could not keep it in stock.         Ms. Steel's tenacity, and flair for theatrics, was made evident in 1975 while she was traveling through Europe looking for gimmicky gift ideas. She came up with the notion of poking fun at the Gucci label by stamping it on toilet paper. She solicited orders from boutiques and formed her own company, Oh Dawn! Inc., she said, ''because when I said I was in the toilet-paper business, people would say, 'Oh Dawn!' ''         Soon enough, the Gucci family sued her for copyright infringement. Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and former administrative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay, agreed to take her case even though, he later recalled, she ''didn't have a dime, she was living by her wits.'' Mr. Davidoff, building a First Amendment defense, made sure the New York tabloids heard about the case, which was quickly headlined ''the toilet-paper caper'' and led to an editorial cartoon showing the Gucci family as Goliath and poor Dawn Steel as David. The case was settled out of court.         By 1978, Ms. Steel had ended a 10-month marriage, sold her business to her ex-husband and asked Mr. Davidoff to place a call to his friend Mr. Katzenberg about a marketing job for her at Paramount. She was hired and quickly impressed her bosses.         Asked in 1993 why men like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Katzenberg had rapidly advanced her career, Ms. Steel replied: ''One was that I was funny. I wasn't heavy furniture. I made them laugh and entertained them. And the other thing was that I could identify a good idea. Not a lot of people can do that. That was my gift.''         She was once compared to a tank by the producer Dan Melnick. ''She would just lower her head and charge through all the red tape and bureaucracy,'' he said. ''She's the most determined woman in the business.''         Her early advocacy of ''Flashdance'' (1983), an unlikely blue-collar musical that turned into a huge hit grossing $95 million in the United States, solidified her position at Paramount. ''Flashdance'' was followed by ''Footloose,'' another hit.         By 1985, Paramount's president, Ned Tanen, appointed Ms. Steel president of production, making her one of the highest-ranking female executives in Hollywood. She had already developed a celebrity persona that made photographers take as many pictures of her at a premiere as a movie actress. She prided herself on her crown of leonine hair -- Ms. Ephron once introduced ''Dawn Steel and her hair'' at an awards luncheon for women -- and her romantic relationships with such figures as the actor Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese, the director.         Ms. Steel's dismissal from Paramount remains one of the more unusual in recent Hollywood history. Having married Mr. Roven in 1985, she was in the hospital after the birth of her only child, Rebecca, in March 1987, when she learned that Frank Mancuso, chairman of Paramount, and Mr. Tanen, chairman of the Motion Picture Group, had ousted her. Exactly why they did was unclear.         As Ms. Steel told Playboy years later, her husband walked into the hospital room with a newspaper under his arm and said, ''I don't know how to tell you this, babe, but you got fired while you were in labor.'' Ms. Steel said. ''I remember thinking, 'I will not cry, I will not let them make me cry.' ''         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a brother, Larry, of Manhattan.         Within six months of her ouster at Paramount, Ms. Steel was offered the job of running Columbia Studios, which was owned by Coca-Cola. Lynda Obst, a producer who was given her early producing jobs by Ms. Steel, said that one of the personal high points of her tenure at Columbia was the decision to restore and reissue the David Lean classic ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' ''It was something that she was extraordinarily proud of,'' said Ms. Obst.         Ms. Steel left the job in 1991, following Sony's purchase of the studio. Her settlement was reportedly in excess of $6 million.         Ms. Steel, in reviewing her career a few years ago, recalled that her commitment to helping women in Hollywood was a slow one. ''I must tell you, I did feel threatened by other women in those early years,'' she said. ''I was so busy climbing up this ladder, staying above the water. If there was only room for one woman in a room, I wanted to be her. I'm not proud of it. I certainly don't feel that way now. It was an absolute evolution for me.''       
         Esther Peterson, a dogged consumer advocate whose work has an impact on Americans every time they buy a can of soup or a box of laundry detergent, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Peterson served in the Administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and worked for businesses as well. Among her accomplishments was the labeling of foods with their nutritional value, so that shoppers can determine whether so many vitamins and proteins are worth their price in calories.         Similarly, she successfully advocated that products be priced per unit, so that a calculator was not needed to figure out whether 14.5 ounces of breakfast cereal at $4.29 or 15.75 ounces at $4.59 is the better buy.         And she accomplished those things with a gentle cajoling that masked an iron determination. At a party marking Mrs. Peterson's 90th birthday last year, Lynda Johnson Robb recalled the help that her father, President Johnson, got from Mrs. Peterson, and said, ''She had a velvet hammer and talked people into doing what was right, even if we didn't know it at the time.''         In her long career, in which she was active until just recently, Mrs. Peterson was an educator, a labor organizer, a public official and an advocate of women's rights.         She organized a strike in Boston in the 1930's among women who sewed aprons at home and were forced by their employer to switch from square pockets to heart-shaped ones, which were more difficult to cut and sew, without any increase in wages.         ''She won the strike,'' her son Iver said over the weekend, ''after she told the women to picket the boss but to dress nicely, because the police in Boston used to back their horses into pickets, 'but if you are properly dressed, the police won't do it.' ''         Mrs. Peterson was born in 1906 in Provo, Utah, to two immigrants from Denmark, Lars Eggertsen, the local superintendent of schools, and his wife, Annie, who, according to her son, ''kept boarders because they didn't pay superintendents much in those days.''         She received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in 1927 and a master's from Teachers' College, Columbia University, in 1930. She held several teaching positions in the 1930's, including one at the innovative Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which brought milliners, telephone operators and garment workers onto the campus.         A Bryn Mawr College official described the school as a place ''not only to teach but to learn from the women workers the problems that together they and we must solve,'' but her son said that Mrs. Peterson's description was more succinct: a place that combined Shakespeare, drama and socialism.         She worked for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the American Federation of Teachers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. In 1961, President Kennedy named her an Assistant Secretary of Labor and Director of the Women's Bureau, an agency that administered the labor laws concerning women.         When Mr. Johnson became President, he brought Mrs. Peterson into the White House as his special adviser for consumer affairs, and she served in a similar capacity for President Carter.         In 1971, at the age of 65, Mrs. Peterson started another career, this time in business as vice president for consumer affairs at Giant Food Inc., the largest supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area.         Odonna Mathews, who worked with Mrs. Peterson as a University of Maryland undergraduate intern and now holds Mrs. Peterson's old position at Giant, said: ''Her friends in consumer activism asked, 'How can you work for a business and represent the consumer?' She showed it could be done.''         At Giant, Ms. Mathews said, she worked with Mrs. Peterson on the grade labeling of food. ''She found it confusing,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She asked, 'What's the difference between U.S. Fancy No. 1 and Extra Fancy?' ''         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson persuaded the supermarket to disclose what seafood had been previously frozen, a widespread practice now but one not in use before then.         ''She got Giant to try nutritional labeling on its private products before it was required by Federal law, comparing calories and proteins,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She got Giant to use open dating -- putting a date by which products like yogurt or milk must be sold.''         Before then, the stores used letter and number combinations to express the dates, a code that was not clear to buyers.         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson visited Giant stores often and was easily recognized by shoppers. She was tall, about 5 feet 10 inches, and she wore her long braided gray hair in a distinctive upsweep on the top of her head, a style described by her children as a ''Gretchen braid.''         Her photograph appeared in many of Giant's advertisements, including one in April 1972 when a shortage of beef caused its price to rocket and Mrs. Peterson urged the supermarket chain's customers to avoid beef purchases until the price came down.         ''You have a right to be informed about meat prices,'' a Giant advertisement said. ''We consumers can help bring prices down. Buy less meat. Use other forms of protein.''         The advertisement listed alternatives to meat like beans and lentils and was signed by Mrs. Peterson.         Mrs. Peterson later was hired by the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents as its consumer adviser, concerning herself particularly with the problems of older people, and she continued to keep a foot in both camps, serving on the board of Consumers Union.         She ended her public service career under yet another Democratic President, serving in a largely honorary role for the Clinton Administration with the United States Delegation to the United Nations.         Besides her son Iver, of Lawrenceville, N.J., who is a reporter for The New York Times, Mrs. Peterson is survived by two other sons, Eric N.,  of Alexandria, Va., and Lars E., of Washington; a daughter, Karen K. Wilken of Fort Collins, Colo., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Jeannette Edris Rockefeller, a lifelong volunteer and philanthropist, a former First Lady of Arkansas and stepmother of its current Lieutenant Governor, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif., where she had lived for nearly 10 years. She was 79.         Mrs. Rockefeller took part in a wide variety of public causes while her husband, Winthrop Rockefeller, was in office, transforming the role of First Lady in Arkansas into a public partnership.         She was the second wife of Mr. Rockefeller, the first Republican Governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction, who served two terms, from 1967 to 1970. They divorced a year later. Mr. Rockefeller died in 1973.         President Clinton, one of his successors in Little Rock, said Mrs. Rockefeller had helped to take the ''New South'' to Arkansas and to lead women into the mainstream of political and public life.         ''She spearheaded education and cultural outreach across the state through the Arkansas Arts Center,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House. He called her ''a strong voice against discrimination.''         Mrs. Rockefeller was an important backer of a Martin Luther King Memorial Service on the State Capitol steps after Dr. King was assassinated in 1968. The rally, attended by thousands of people, helped defuse what might have been a tense situation in the state.         A native of Seattle, Mrs. Rockefeller studied at the University of Washington and Finch College in New York, majoring in psychology. She met Winthrop Rockefeller while working with teen-age drug addicts and mentally ill children in New York, and they married in 1956.         Mrs. Rockefeller was president of the National Mental Health Association and the Arkansas Association for Mental Health. She served on the national board of the Urban League and the White House Commission on Mental Health under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. More recently she headed the AIDS Assistance Project in Palm Springs.         In addition to her stepson, Lieut. Gov. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, her survivors include a son and daughter from another marriage, Bruce Bartley of Little Rock, and Anne Bartley McNeil of San Francisco.
