         Audrey Hepburn, the actress who epitomized Hollywood chic in the 1950's and 60's, died yesterday at her home in Tolochenaz, near Lausanne, Switzerland. She was 63 years old and had undergone surgery for colon cancer in November.         Her death from cancer was announced by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, for which she had been a special ambassador since 1988.         In recent years, she made few movies, but traveled the world raising money and awareness for the U.N. organization. Her last screen role, in 1989, was a cameo as an angel easing the hero toward death in Steven Spielberg's "Always," a role in which the character's grace and serenity echoed the image Miss Hepburn had maintained throughout a 40-year career. An Oscar for a Princess         Her first major film role made her a star. In the 1953 romance "Roman Holiday," she played a princess who runs from her duties and falls in love with a journalist played by Gregory Peck. Audiences were enchanted by her combination of grace, elegance and high spirits, and she won an Academy Award as best actress.         The same year she won her Oscar, she won a Tony for her performance in the play "Ondine." Bosley Crowther, The New York Times critic, described her in words that characterized her youthful appeal. He called her "a slender, elfin and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike."         In a string of films that followed, she continued to play the lithe young thing with stars in her eyes and the ability to make Cinderella transformations. In "Sabrina" (1954), she was a chauffeur's daughter forced to choose between wealthy brothers, played by William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. In "Funny Face" (1957), opposite Fred Astaire, she played a bookstore clerk turned high-fashion model.         Descriptions of her beauty and appeal inevitably included the word "gamine." She was boyishly slender, with an aristocratic bearing, the trace of a European accent and a hint of mischief.  'A Wild-Eyed Doe'         Billy Wilder once recalled directing her in the 1957 film "Love in the Afternoon": "You looked around and suddenly there was this dazzling creature looking like a wild-eyed doe prancing in the forest. Everybody on the set was in love within five minutes."         Among her most popular and acclaimed roles was that of Holly Golightly, the backwoods beauty turned New York sophisticate in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961).         At the height of her career, she worked with such directors as William Wyler and George Cukor and acted with the great male movie stars of her day, playing the younger woman opposite Gary Cooper ("Love in the Afternoon"), Cary Grant ("Charade," 1963) and Rex Harrison, in the 1964 movie version of "My Fair Lady."         There was some grumbling from the theater world when she was cast as Eliza Doolittle in "My Fair Lady," winning the role over Julie Andrews, who had originated it on Broadway. Ms. Hepburn's singing was dubbed in the film by Marni Nixon. The film won several Oscar nominations, but Miss Hepburn was not nominated. A Blind Woman Terrorized         Throughout her career, she also took on dramatic roles. She won an Oscar nomination for the title role of a woman questioning her vocation in "A Nun's Story' (1959). She played a woman enduring 20 years of an embattled marriage, opposite Albert Finney, in "Two for the Road" (1967). And she won her fifth Oscar nomination for her role as a blind woman terrorized in her own home in "Wait Until Dark" (1967).  Other nominations were for "Sabrina" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         After "Wait Until Dark," she left full-time acting and lived mostly in Switzerland.         Miss Hepburn returned to the screen occasionally. In "Robin and Marian" (1976) she played the middle-aged Maid Marian to Sean Connery's Robin Hood. The role was considered the triumph of her later career and a reflection of the graceful way the actress herself had moved into middle age.         She also made some poorly received films, including "Bloodline" (1979) amd "They All Laughed" (1981).         Miss Hepburn, whose name originally was Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston, was born on May 4, 1929, near Brussels, to a Dutch mother and an English father, and was educated largely in London. During World War II, she and her mother were caught vacationing in Holland when the Nazis invaded and her family endured much hardship during the occupation. During the war, one of her brothers was taken to a labor camp, and an uncle and cousin were executed. She once said the family was reduced to eating tulip bulbs. Spotted by Colette         But when she returned to London after the war, her life took the glamorous turn she would maintain for the rest of her life. She was a ballet student and model. On the Riviera, she was spotted by the author Colette, who insisted that Miss Hepburn star in the Broadway version of "Gigi," which led to "Roman Holiday."         She attributed her work with Unicef to her childhood experience of hunger and fear during the war.         As Goodwill ambassador for Unicef she traveled extensively in Africa and Latin America. She visited Ethiopia during the drought to call attention to the plight of starving children. In 1991 she described her Unicef role as "talking my head off," and said, "I just decided to do as much as possible in the time that I'm still up to it."         Last year she visited Somalia. It was shortly after returning from that trip that her cancer was diagnosed. With Frequent Appearances         Even in her last years she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991. She was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that she and Elizabeth Taylor would receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award this year.         In 1954, she married the actor Mel Ferrer (with whom she later co-starred in "War and Peace.") They were divorced in 1968. In 1969 she married Andrea Dotti, an Italian psychiatrist, from whom she was later divorced.         Her companion since 1980 was Robert Wolders, a Dutch actor. She is also survived by two sons, Sean, from her marriage to Mr. Ferrer, and Luca, from her marriage to Dr. Dotti. The Sprite in Designer Clothing         Audrey Hepburn made her American stage and screen debuts in 1951, and two years later her gamin haircut, sylphlike shape and tomboyish but elegant demeanor in "Roman Holiday" made her a star and won her an Oscar. These are the plays and films in which she appeared.

         Adina Blady Szwajger, a pediatrician who struggled to save young lives in the Children's Hospital in the Warsaw ghetto and survived to recount the horrors, died Feb. 18 in Lodz, Poland. She was 75 and lived in Warsaw.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said Jerzy Warman, a friend in Manhattan.         When the Nazis finally shut the hospital Dr. Szwajger (pronounced SHVY-gher), despite her Jewishness, escaped the ghetto with special identity papers, then worked with the resistance.         After the war she resumed work as a pediatrician and occasionally spoke about her harrowing experiences. But she kept the most haunting episode a secret for decades, until she was ill and in retirement.         Her memoirs circulated in a Solidarity underground magazine in the mid-1980's, then were published in the West in 1988.  'Damning and Uplifting'         In a review of the Pantheon edition in The New York Times, Kati Marton said: "Dr. Szwajger's unsentimental, almost matter-of-fact memoir of the German occupation of Poland is the most damning and most uplifting of the many accounts of the Holocaust that I have read. I did not think the well-covered ground of Nazi atrocities could still astonish. 'I Remember Nothing More: The Warsaw Children's Hospital and the Jewish Resistance' proved me wrong."         Her story began with the high hopes of a young medical student from the University of Warsaw. She described herself as bubbling, happy and proud to help youngsters at the hospital.         But soon the hospital was filled with youngsters dying from tuberculosis, typhus and starvation. The Nazis occupiers sealed off the ghetto and eventually marched a steady stream of people to their deaths.         "So we tried to save them with those scraps of food, medicines and injections," she wrote. Some children revived enough to smile -- "except that this was the kind of smile that made your hair stand on end and your flesh crawl." She described "famished skeletons" fighting over the soup pot, spilling it and lapping the slop off the floor.  'Corpses and Living Together'         Every day she went to a square to looking for stray children, befriending a Ukrainian guard with vodka.         "Once he was talking to me when a little girl appeared at a window," she wrote. "He raised his gun, shot her and carried on talking to me. I picked up a child, said goodbye to him and walked away -- only I didn't know how to hold the child so that it wouldn't be hit if the Ukrainian shot at me."         At the hospital, toward the end, "corpses and living all lay together" as soldiers killed some patients and ordered others to the death camps. A nurse pleaded with Dr. Szwajger to inject the nurse's bedridden mother with a lethal dose of morphine.         The doctor agreed. She also decided -- and this secret she kept for 45 years -- to carry out euthanasia on some of the children. In the infants' ward, she spoonfed each of them a fatal dose of morphine.         "Just as, during those two years of real work in the hospital, I had bent down over the little beds," she wrote, "so now I poured this last medicine into those tiny mouths. And downstairs there was screaming because the Germans were already there, taking the sick from the wards to the cattle trucks." 'Why I Was Different'         She told the older children to get into bed, and "this medicine was going to make their pain disappear."         "So they lay down and after a few minutes ----," she wrote. "I don't know how many. But the next time I went into that room, they were asleep. And then I don't know what happened after that."         That memory never left, "and that's why I was always different from everybody else."         Dr. Szwajger's husband, a law student, was killed by the Nazis, who tricked him into turning himself in. Later she became pregnant by a man in the resistance. But she arranged an abortion, and also arranged abortions for three other women, because she was convinced that "children had no right to be born" into such a world.         Dr. Szwajger later married Wladyslaw Swidowski, who died several years ago. She is survived by two daughters, Hanna and Alina, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, all in Poland.       
         Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won several Emmy awards for her work on Olympics broadcasts for ABC Sports, died yesterday at her home in West Tisbury, Mass. She was 63 and also lived in Vail, Colo.         The cause of death was cancer of the uterus, said her son, Robert P. Riger of Manhattan.         In 1973, Ms. Sanger became one of the first female producers in network television sports when she was hired by ABC to develop women's programs. Over the next decade, she produced dozens of programs for the network, including parts of Olympic broadcasts from Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.         She left ABC in 1985 and moved to London, but continued working part-time for the network and also produced programs for other organizations. She was a member of several professional groups and also was an adjunct lecturer in the media arts department at the University of Arizona.         Ms. Sanger was born Sept. 15, 1929, in Hong Kong and attended Smith College before earning a master's degree in public law and government at Columbia University. Before joining ABC Sports, she worked for several other television and news organizations.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three other children, Christopher Riger of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Victoria Riger Phillips of New Orleans, and Charlotte Riger Hull of West Tisbury, Mass.; a sister, Helen Sanger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  March 9, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won Emmy awards for sports broadcasts, misidentified one of her residences. It was Vail, Ariz., not Colorado.       
         Judith Rothschild, an abstract painter whose works were shown internationally and who left a multi-million-dollar estate to support contemporary American artists, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan and in Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Ms. Rothschild painted for 55 years, beginning as a teen-ager. Her works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery in Washington and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., among others.         Her works were exhibited in many group shows and in several one-woman shows, including the first devoted to an American artist by the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, in 1991. Legacy to Museums and Artists         Ms. Rothschild left a collection that included her paintings and major works by Mondrian, Matisse, Brancusi, Gris and Picasso. The estate could bring up to $40 million, said its executor, Erik Stapper, and Harvey Miller, the trustee of the Judith Rothschild Foundation.         Under her will, the proceeds are to be used to foster art by helping public galleries and museums buy works of contemporary American artists over the next 25 years.         Ms. Rothschild was a founder and president of the American Abstract Artists Association. She also served on the boards of the American Federation of Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the New York Studio School and the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center.         A longtime colleague of Robert Motherwell, she joined him and a few other artists in forming a cooperative, the Long Point Gallery, in Provincetown on Cape Cod. A Youthful Talent         Ms. Rothschild displayed a flair for art as a youngster. Because of her interests, her parents began collecting art, including some of the major pieces now part of her estate. Her father, Herbert, owned a furniture manufacturing company.         Ms. Rothschild was born in New York City and graduated from Wellesley College. She studied painting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, and with Karl Knaths and Hans Hofmann.         She worked in oils and did many collages. Her style ranged from Cubist imagery to symbolic use of astrology charts, timetables, stamps and railroad tickets.         Her 23-year marriage to Anton Myrer, a novelist, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Manhattan, and a sister, Barbara Michaels of Ossining, N.Y.       
         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Jane Pack Dessau, an advertising executive, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer after a four-year battle, her husband, Stephen P. Dessau said.         In 1989, Jane Pack, as she was known professionally, was named an executive vice president of Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, a subsidiary of Grey Advertising. In 1988, Advertising Age magazine named her one of the 100 "best and brightest" advertising and marketing women in the United States.         After 13 years with Levine Huntley, she left the organization, because of her health, in 1991, shortly before the agency closed. Throughout her illness, she was active in Reach for Recovery, a program of the American Cancer Society, and the T. J. Martell Foundation for Cancer and Aids Research.         Mrs. Dessau was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from SUNY-Albany and received an M.B.S. from Baruch College.         Besides her husband, survivors include a daughter, Julianna Sara, and a son, David Stephen; her parents, Dr. Milton Pack and Phyllis Pack of Brooklyn, and two brothers, Dr. Philip Pack of Scarsdale and Dr. Michael Pack of Boston.       
         Maria Tolstoy, a professor of Russian language and a granddaughter of the novelist Leo Tolstoy, died on Monday at home in Manhattan. She was 85.         She had a brief illness, said Cynthia Whittaker, a friend.         Ms. Tolstoy fled her native Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, resettled in Czechoslovakia, then left there in 1939 to escape the Nazis and World War II.         Arriving by ship in America in 1940, she said, "I believe, with my grandfather, that every person, every country, has a right to freedom." She helped Soviet and German emigres publish political material, worked on foreign broadcasts of Radio Liberty and assisted the United States Army.         Ms. Tolstoy, whose mother was Irish, was fluent in both English and Russian. Her parents met when her father visited Ireland to buy race horses. Active in Politics         She taught Russian at Cornell, Columbia and Indiana Universities, at the University of Michigan and at Hunter College. She retired from Hunter in 1980 but continued tutoring students the rest of her life.         Ms. Tolstoy was active in American politics as a Republican but also supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and was state co-chairwoman of Republicans for Cuomo.         She was also known for her published Russian poetry on the solitude of the emigre. With the recent fall of Communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, she expressed interest in a return visit to her native country but was too frail to make the trip.         Ms. Tolstoy left the Soviet Union in 1925 at the age of 17. She completed her studies for a doctorate in Slavic linguistics at Charles University in Prague, but the Nazis shut down the school before it granted the degree.         Her marriage to Vladimir Mansvetov ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Tatiana Benetkova of Prague, and two grandchildren.       
         Penelope Gilliatt, a writer of fiction, journalism and screenplays, and a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 61.         She had been in poor health for some time.         Ms. Gilliatt (pronounced with a hard G) was best known for the film criticism she wrote from 1968 to 1979 for The New Yorker, where she shared reviewing duties with Pauline Kael, and for her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," a 1971 film starring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch.         Her short stories were marked by precision, compression and a gift for conveying a dramatic situation through dialogue. Anthony Burgess, reviewing her short-story collection "Nobody's Business" for The New York Times Book Review in 1971, wrote: "She is intelligent, economical, poignant, highly contemporary. She is also innovative."         Ms. Gilliatt, whose maiden name was Penelope Conner, was born in London. Her father, a barrister and later a judge, worked as a director of the BBC. After attending Queen's College, a private school, she came to the United States to enter Bennington College in Vermont on a scholarship. She dropped out during her first year. "I thought I should get on with life, and I'd run out of money," she later said in a newspaper interview. A Contest Winner         A brief period working for the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York ended when she won a short-story contest sponsored by British Vogue. She returned to London to join the magazine's staff, eventually becoming its features editor. She also contributed freelance articles to The Spectator and New Statesman.         From 1961 to 1967, Ms. Gilliatt served as film critic and, for one year, drama critic of The Observer in London. In 1968 she joined The New Yorker, where, in addition to reviewing film, she contributed many short stories and profiles.         Her first novel, "One by One" (1965), about a menage a trois, contained the seeds of her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," about a London couple, a man and a woman, in love with the same man. The screenplay, which was widely praised for its sensitive, literate treatment of a potentially exploitative subject, was nominated for an Academy Award.  The National Society of Film Critics named it the best screenplay of the year, and the New York film critics, in a tie vote, named her co-winner for best screenplay with Larry McMurtry, for "The Last Picture Show.         Ms. Gilliatt left The New Yorker in 1979 on an extended leave of absence after writing a profile on the novelist Graham Greene whose accuracy was challenged by Greene. A novelist, Michael Mewshaw, also complained to the magazine that material in the article had been taken, without credit, from an artcile he had written on Greene for The Nation. At the time, Ms. Gilliatt said that Mr. Greene's charges were a subtle form of practical joke. She continued to contribute short stories to the magazine and in recent years wrote profiles of John Cleese and Jonathan Miller. Known for Her Stories         Although Ms. Gilliatt wrote five novels, including "A State of Change" (1968) and "The Cutting Edge" (1979), she was best known for her stories, collected in "Come Back if It Doesn't Get Better" (1969), "Nobody's Business" (1972), "Splendid Lives" (1978), "Quotations From Other Lives" (1982) and "They Sleep Without Dreaming" (1985).         Ms. Gilliatt's New Yorker film criticism and profiles were collected in "Unholy Fools" (1973) and "Three-Quarter Face" (1980). Her last book was "To Wit: Skin and Bones of Comedy" (1990), a collection of essays.         Both her marriages, to Roger Gilliatt, a neurosurgeon, and the playwright John Osborne ended in divorce.         She is survived by a sister, Angela Conner of London, and a daughter, Nolan Osborne Parker of East Sussex.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Arleen Auger, an American soprano who was renowned for both her commanding presence on the opera stage and the subtlety of her song interpretations, died on Thursday at the home of a friend in Leusden, a suberb of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. She was 53 and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Mary Lou Falcone, Miss Auger's publicity agent, said the cause was brain cancer.         Miss Auger's most famous performance was her appearance at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, on July 23, 1986. She sang Mozart's "Exsultate, Jubilate" as part of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, which was televised globally and seen by some 500 million people.  Debut in Vienna         Mozart was always at the core of her repertory. Miss Auger (pronounced awe-ZHAY) had exactly the right flexibility, coloring and vocal weight for Mozart opera roles and concert works, and they were the vehicles with which she had her biggest successes. She made her operatic debut as the Queen of the Night in a 1967 Vienna State Opera production of "Die Zauberflote." Nine years later she made her New York debut in the same role at the New York City Opera. Among her recent recordings are highly praised portrayals of Donna Anna in "Don Giovanni" and the Countess in "Le Nozze di Figaro."         She also won great acclaim for her performances of Bach, Handel and Haydn, and although she did not eschew the use of vibrato, as other early-music singers did, she was considered a supremely stylish interpreter of that repertory. Still, she resolutely resisted being typecast. She constantly expanded her repertory, and applied her rich tone and her thoughtful sense of line to everything from Schubert and Schumann lieder and turn-of-the-century French art songs to works by Weill, Berg and Schoenberg. Libby Larsen and Judith Zaimont were among the composers from whom she commissioned new song cycles.         "I sing Bach, Mozart, contemporary music and everything in between," she wrote in an article for Keynote in 1985. "If it's for my voice and my voice can do it well, I'm happy to do it."         But Miss Auger was a late bloomer, musically: she did not begin studying voice until she was out of college and working as an elementary-school teacher in Chicago. And when she auditioned for the Vienna State Opera, she knew only one role, the Queen of the Night.  Taught Elementary Schoolers         Arleen Auger was born in South Gate, Calif., on Sept. 13, 1939. She studied the piano and violin briefly as a child and sang in community choirs, but she later told interviewers that she had had very little exposure to classical music when she was growing up. She attended California State University at Long Beach, where she earned a degree in education in 1963. For the next four years, she taught elementary school in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.         The world of opera and art song opened for her in 1965, when she was teaching in Chicago and began studying voice with Ralph Errolle. She apparently progressed quickly; two years later, when she was teaching first grade in Los Angeles, she won first prize in the I. Victor Fuchs Competition. The prize included a trip to Vienna to audition for the Volksoper. Her audition repertory included three pieces: the two Queen of the Night arias and Olympia's aria from Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann."         As it turned out, the soprano Lucia Popp had just withdrawn from a production of "Zauberflote" at the Vienna State Opera. That company's director, Josef Krips, heard Miss Auger's audition at the smaller Volksoper, and offered her a contract. When she joined the company, she later said, she knew only the one role, had no stage experience and did not speak German. She made her debut without a rehearsal, and had to ask other singers where to go as she was pushed out on stage.  Sought Expanded Repertory         But she prospered in Vienna. During her first two years she added a dozen roles to her repertory, and she remained with the company until 1974, when she began to find the State Opera's repertory expectations too constricting. When she left the company she began singing more frequently at other European houses, including La Scala. She also expanded her recital repertory and took a teaching position at the Academy of Music and Drama in Frankfurt, where she taught until 1987.         She had by then become intent on regulating the pace of her career. She refused to sing roles if she did not consider herself ready for them, sometimes alienating conductors whose invitations she declined. But she said later that those decisions saved her voice and prolonged her career.         By the early 1980's, Miss Auger's European career was thriving, though her concert and opera appearances in the United States had been relatively few. She had cemented her reputation as an early-music singer at the Oregon Bach Festival, directed by Helmuth Rilling (with whom she recorded more than 50 Bach cantatas) and at the New England Bach Festival. But at the time, American listeners knew her mostly through what was already a vast discography.         Miss Auger began to cultivate an American following seriously in January 1984, when she sang Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Strauss songs at her New York debut recital at Alice Tully Hall. Reviewing that concert in The New York Times, Donal Henahan praised the clarity of her tone and her sensitivity to musical and textual nuances. "Although pure lyricism is obviously Miss Auger's strong point, there is more to her than that," he wrote, adding that she "is a singing actress of some depth." Explored the Nuances         Thereafter, Miss Auger performed more frequently in the United States, and her recitals were high points of the concert season for fans of art song. Statuesque and attractive, she was a compelling and elegant stage personality who invariably gave the impression of having thoroughly explored both the overt emotional resonance and the underlying psychological nuances of the songs on her programs. She continued performing until last season, when her illness forced her to cancel touring plans and recording projects.         Miss Auger made nearly 200 recordings, documenting a vast repertory that ranged from her Bach, Mozart and Handel specialties to a series of both standard and offbeat opera and song projects. Many of her recordings won international awards, including the Grand Prix du Disque, the Edison Prize and the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis.         She is survived by her parents, Everett and Doris Auger, and a brother, Ralph Auger of Healdsburg, Calif. SELECTED RECORDINGS         Arleen Auger's recordings document her talents as opera singer, recitalist and soloist in oratorios and symphonic choral works. These are some of her recordings, all on compact disk.         Brahms: A German Requiem (Telarc)         Canteloube: Songs of the Auvergne (Virgin)         Handel: "Orlando" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Messiah" (Archiv)         Handel and Bach Arias (Delos)         Mendelssohn: A Midsummer Night's Dream (Philips)         Monteverdi: "L'Incoronazione di Poppea" (Virgin)         Mozart: "Le Nozze di Figaro" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Lucio Silla" (Philips)         Mozart/Strauss/Wolf: Lieder (Sony Classical)         Strauss: Four Last Songs (Telarc)         Wolf: Lieder (Hyperion)         "Love Songs": works by Copland, Britten, Strauss, Schumann, Gounod, Mahler, Foster, others (Delos)       
         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Halina Rodzinski, who worked for Polish charities and wrote "Our Two Lives," a memoir about her husband, the conductor Artur Rodzinski, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was chronic leukemia, said her son, Richard.         Mrs. Rodzinski was born in Warsaw. In 1934, she married Rodzinski and went with him to Cleveland, where he was music director of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Mrs. Rodzinski was active in several Polish charitable and cultural organizations, including Polish Mutual Assistance, founded in 1956 to help Poles in the United States who had been left destitute by World War II. From 1959 until her death she was president of the Committee for the Blind of Poland.         She was also a founding member and honorary chairman of the Harlem School of the Arts and for many years was on the advisory board of Young Concert Artists.         Mrs. Rodzinski's 1976 memoir, "Our Two Lives," received critical praise for its vivid portrayal of her husband as an autocratic, temperamental genius who conducted with a baton in his right hand and a loaded revolver in his hip pocket. Mr. Rodzinski, who died in 1958, was music director of the New York Philharmonic from 1943 to 1948.         In May, Mrs. Rodzinski was awarded Poland's highest civilian honor, the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit.         In addition to her son, who is the executive director of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, she is survived by a sister, Aniela Mieczyslawska of London, and a grandchild.       
         Elisabeth Draper, an interior designer in New York for 60 years, died in her sleep at her home in Manhattan on Monday. She was 93.         John R. Taylor Jr., one of Mrs. Draper's grandnephews, said she had been in declining health for the last four years.         Mrs. Draper was one of the grande dames of decorating in an era when a professionally decorated home was a mark of privilege.         She became known for comfortable rooms that mixed antiques with contemporary furnishings.         In 1967, she said: "I came along in that lovely ladies' era of decorating and just before all the talented men began emerging in the field."         Self-taught, Mrs. Draper was responsible for the decor of countless country houses, city apartments and houses as well as executive suites in banks.         She was born Elisabeth Carrington Frank in New York City in 1900, the daughter of Charles and Louise Frank. Mr. Frank was a banker. She attended Miss Spence's School but left before her graduation in 1918 to be trained as a radio operator 1st class, and served in that capacity until the end of World War I. Eisenhowers Were Clients         Soon after the war, she married Seth Low, a banker. When the couple were divorced in 1929, Mrs. Draper began her career in decorating with her sister Tiffany Taylor, establishing a firm called Taylor & Low.         In 1935, she married Dr. George Draper, an internist and specialist in psychosomatic medicine. In 1936, Mrs. Draper established her business under her own name.         Mrs. Draper was prominent in the Long Island social world for decades. President and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower were among her numerous clients. She decorated their New York home as well as the Eisenhower farmhouse in Gettysburg, Pa.         She decorated the American Embassy in Paris for Ambassador Amory Houghton, worked on a number of rooms at the White House, and did the interiors of Blair House. The Old Merchant's House on East Fourth Street in Manhattan was restored under her direction.         Mrs. Draper is survived by her son, Seth Low Jr., of Syosset, L.I., and her stepdaughter, Penelope Buchanan of Cleveland.         The funeral will be tomorrow at 11 A.M. at St. James's Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Dr. Wilma Thompson Donahue, an expert in the psychology of aging and director emeritus of the University of Michigan Institute of Gerontology, died on Tuesday at her home in Ann Arbor. She was 92.         She had had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Donahue was among the country's first clinical psychologists when she began her career at Ann Arbor in 1935 as a practitioner of the branch of psychology that deals with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of personality and behavior problems. Her reputation widened in the 1950's as her name appeared in journals and books on housing, medical care and other subjects concerning the elderly.         She served on state commissions on aging and was founding president of the Michigan Society of Gerontology. Ten years ago, she was in the first group inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         Nationally, Dr. Donahue took part in White House Conferences on Aging in 1961, 1971 and 1981 and was a member of related policy boards for Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. She served for 10 years as director of the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, a post she left 10 years ago.         Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, she earned three degrees in psychology at the University of Michigan, including a doctorate in 1937. She practiced at the mental hygiene clinic of the Student Health Service starting in 1935 and was appointed an instructor in the department of psychology three years later.         In 1951, she became the founding director of the university's division of gerontology and took the same position at the transformed Institute of Gerontology in 1966. She retired in 1970.         At the time, the university's Regents cited her ultimate mission as apolitical and purely educational: "She sought to elicit the truth about old people, especially those distressed in mind, body, or estate."         Dr. Donahue's husband, Lester, died in 1963 after 41 years of marriage.       
         Tatiana Troyanos, an American mezzo-soprano whose enormous repertory covered the full range of operatic history, from Monteverdi to Philip Glass, died on Saturday evening at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her manager, Janice Mayer at Columbia Artists, said the cause was cancer.         Miss Troyanos's dark, flexible mezzo was ideal for the wrenching emotionalism of such characters as Carmen, Kundry in Wagner's "Parsifal," Eboli in Verdi's "Don Carlo," Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," and both Purcell's and Berlioz's Didos.         She was also a superb player of trouser roles. Her Octavian in "Rosenkavalier" was long the centerpiece of her repertory, and early in her career she gave highly regarded performances as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Romeo in Bellini's "Capuletti e i Montecchi." And she was prized for the kind of vocal and dramatic agility, as well as the ability to learn difficult roles quickly, that made her a singer of choice for revivals of rarely performed Handel and Mozart works.         Her appearances in the last year indicate the scope of her repertory. In September she created the role of Queen Isabella in Philip Glass's "Voyage" at the Met. She performed in two "Ring" cycles, as Waltraute in the Metropolitan Opera's "Gotterdammerung" and Fricka in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's "Rheingold." In May she gave what James R. Oestreich called in The New York Times "a searching, almost harrowing reading" of the Mahler Third Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and last month she sang Clairon in the San Francisco Opera production of Strauss's "Capriccio."         Tatiana Troyanos was born in New York on September 12, 1938, and grew up in Forest Hills. Her mother was German and her father Greek, and though she admittedly neither spoke Greek nor cared for Greek food, she identified closely with her father's homeland and described herself as Greek-American.         Both her parents were singers, and she sang in school and church choruses, but her first serious musical training was as a pianist. It was only during her high school years, when she began to listen to Maria Callas recordings and attend Metropolitan Opera performances as a standee, that she decided to study singing. While working at Random House as a secretary she enrolled at the Juilliard School, but left when the dean refused to let her study with the teacher of her choice, Hans Heinz. She studied privately with him for many years, continuing even after she began to sing professionally.         Miss Troyanos found few opportunities in New York, but she was a fighter: When the Met offered her small roles, she turned them down, and when she was denied a chorus role in "The Sound of Music" because Richard Rodgers thought her too glamorous to play a nun, she returned looking disheveled and got the part. Her first break was in 1963, when Julius Rudel signed her to the New York City Opera roster. She made her debut that year as Hippolyta in Benjamin Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream," and also sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex."         In 1965, following Heinz's suggestion that she would benefit from experience at a European house, she joined the Hamburg State Opera, where she made her way through a large part of the mezzo-soprano repertory in her decade there. But her first major appearances were at Aix-en-Provence, France, where she made her debut in 1966 as the Composer in Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," and at Covent Garden, where she performed her first Octavian in 1969, learning the role in a week to fill in for another singer.         Miss Troyanos made her Met debut as Octavian in 1976, and became one of the house's most frequently heard mezzos. Among the many roles she sang there were the Countess Geschwitz in Berg's "Lulu," Sesto in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito," Charlotte in "Werther," Adalgisa in "Norma," and her regular showpieces, Carmen, Kundry, Santuzza and the Composer.         In addition to her opera appearances, Miss Troyanos was an eloquent recitalist. Particularly interesting in recent years were her duo recitals with the soprano Benita Valente. After their last New York performance together, at Alice Tully Hall in January 1992, Bernard Holland wrote in The Times: "Ms. Troyanos's mezzo-soprano is intended less as a thing of beauty (which it often is) than as a conduit for the pain, exaltation and rushes of emotion that suffuse her musical personality."  A Recorded Legacy         Miss Troyanos made many first-rate recordings. Among those available on compact disk are performances in Leonard Bernstein's recording of his "West Side Story" (Deutsche Grammophon), "Carmen" (London), "Werther" (Angel), "Cosi Fan Tutte" (RCA), "Le Nozze di Figaro" (Deutsche Grammophon) and Schoenberg's "Gurre-Lieder" (Philips). Her recent San Francisco appearance in "Capriccio" was taped for video release; other video performances include a memorable Sesto in the Jean-Pierre Ponelle production of "La Clemenza di Tito" (Deutsche Grammophon) and, with the Metropolitan Opera, Venus in Wagner's "Tannhauser" and Dido in Berlioz's "Troyens."         She is survived by her mother, Hildegard Fournier of Florida, and her brother, John, of New York.       
         Nora Kildare Copeland, whose volunteer work for Catholic Charities spanned 25 years, died on Aug. 30 at her home in Sarasota, Fla. Her family said she was in her late 80's.         Mrs. Copeland was a resident of Manhattan before she moved to Sarasota in 1977. She was born in Cygnet, Ohio. Early in her life she appeared in National Stage Productions on Broadway, and left the stage to marry Abbot J. Copeland.         Her charity work was recognized by the Roman Catholic Church with an investiture at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1982 where she was made a Lady Grand Cross, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.         In addition to her husband of 64 years, she is survived by two sons: Denis K. and Michael J.; nine grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.       
         Rita Karin, a stage, film and television actress who performed in both Yiddish and English, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ill with pneumonia, but no cause of death was listed on the death certificate, said her son, Dr. Michael Horowitz of Evanston, Ill.         Ms. Karin was born in Vilna, Poland, in 1919. During World War II, she studied at the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Her parents and other relatives in Poland were killed in the Holocaust. In 1945, she left the Soviet Union for Germany, where she narrated "The Mills of Death," the first United States Information Agency documentary on the liberation of the concentration camps.         In Germany, the American Government helped Ms. Karin and her husband, Norbert Horowitz, also a graduate of the Moscow State Jewish Theater, to create a Yiddish theater that performed for Holocaust survivors throughout Europe. Came to U.S. in 1949         In 1949, Ms. Karin and her husband immigrated to the United States, where she began to act in the Yiddish theater in New York City. She was also well known for her readings of the work of Sholom Aleichem, delivered with other actors at the home of Bel Kaufman each year on the anniversary of the writer's death.         In 1960, she made her Broadway debut in "The Wall"; the next year, she appeared in "A Call on Kuprin." In 1975, she was in "Yentl." Off Broadway, she appeared in "The Pocket Watch," "Scuba Duba," "The House of Blue Leaves" and "The World of Sholom Aleichem."         Her film credits include "The Big Fix," "Enemies, a Love Story," "Sophie's Choice" and, most recently, "The Pickle." On television, she appeared in the 1989 sitcom "Chicken Soup," as the mother of the character played by Jackie Mason, and, this year, in the anthology series "TriBeCa."         In addition to her son, Ms. Karin is survived by a daughter, Rochelle Axelrud of Woodmere, L.I.; four granddaughters, and one grandson.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Florence Small Gaynor, the first black woman to head a major teaching hospital in the United States, died on Sept. 16 at Christiana Medical Center in Newark, Del. She was 72.         She died unexpectedly after a sudden brain hemorrhage, said her son, Wardell.         Mrs. Gaynor, a registered nurse by training, rose through the ranks of administration at several large New York hospitals at a time when there were few women or blacks in such positions. In February 1971, she was chosen from a field of 20 candidates, the rest of them male, to be executive director of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, making her the first black woman ever to head one of the city's municipal hospitals.         Eighteen months later she accepted a job in New Jersey, as executive director of Martland Hospital in Newark, a 600-bed teaching hospital operated by the state's medical school. Now part of the the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, it was then the state's largest hospital. Struggle to Become Nurse         Born in Jersey City, the fourth of six girls, Mrs. Gaynor fought racial barriers from the time she graduated from high school, at the age of 15, to get training to become a nurse. The first nursing school where she applied, at Jersey City Medical Center, turned her down because it did not admit blacks.         She worked at a doll factory and at an electric plant to help support her family and then applied the nursing school at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated as a registered nurse in 1946 and worked first at Queens General Hospital.         After a stint as a public-health nurse in East Harlem for New York City's Health Department, she worked as head nurse at Francis Delafield Hospital in Washington Heights and as a school nurse with the Board of Education in Newark.         At the same time she was pursuing a bachelor's degree in nursing and then a master's degree in public health at New York University. She spent the summer of 1965 at the University of Oslo in Norway studying the Scandinavian health system.         When she returned, she pursued a career in hospital administration, starting in the pediatrics department of Lincoln Hospital, which is staffed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. After a series of promotions, she was named assistant administrator in 1970.         After heading Sydenham Hospital and Martland Hospital, she left the Northeast to serve from 1976 to 1980 as director of hospital and health services at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school that has produced many of the nation's black doctors.         From 1980 until 1984, she was director of the West Philadelphia Community Mental Health Consortium in Philadelphia. For two years, before she retired in Wilmington, Del., she worked again as a school nurse, in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Wardell Michael Gaynor of Brooklyn and Matthew Small Gaynor of Cincinnati; a daughter, Brenda L. Gainer of Wilmington; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A Boston resident, she was 78.         She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman & Sons funeral homes in Boston.         A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus. For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979. Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.         Born on a farm near Winchester, Va., she became fascinated with fungi that form in garden soil and get into the blood, brain and lungs of humans, where the fungi grow and cause trouble. She told an interviewer after the 1979 award that the fungi "are molds like the ones that grow on bread in the fridge or on damp shoes in the closet."         She trained at Ohio State University, American University, George Washington University and Duke University as well as on the job as a microbiologist. In 1948, she became chief of medical mycology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington.         She left in 1962 to become an associate professor of medical mycology at Harvard University's School of Public Health and advanced to full professor in 1970. Three years later she accepted an appointment as professor of medical sciences at Southern Illinois University and also served as department chairwoman from 1974 until her academic retirement in 1977.         She then worked on foreign-student exchanges for the American Society of Microbiology in what was then the Soviet Union for three years. More recently, she worked as a volunteer at Brigham & Women's Hospital and with battered women in the Boston area.         Professor Campbell is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Flint of Daytona Beach, Fla.       
         Christine O'Reilly, one of the tennis-playing triplets from Ridgewood, N.J., died on Sunday at the University of California hospital at Irvine. She never regained consciousness after suffering a severe head injury in an automobile accident in Irvine early Saturday morning. She was 25.         John Korff, a tennis promoter from Mahwah, N.J., said that Miss O'Reilly had been in California scouting sites for a balloon festival next year. He said she was the lone passenger in a car driven by Steven Allan Evans, 29, the pilot who had flown her over prospective sites. Mr. Evans was killed instantly when the car struck a utility pole.         The youngest of identical triplets, Miss O'Reilly and her sisters, Patty and Terri, were celebrities in Ridgewood almost from the moments they were born on Jan. 18, 1968.         Until injuries knocked her out for her senior season, Christine played No. 1 singles at Duke, compiling a 69-19 record.         After graduating with degrees in economics, all three joined the women's tour, but never cracked the top 100. Christine and Terri left the tour last year to join Korff Enterprises.         In addition to her sisters, Miss O'Reilly is survived by her parents, Eugene and Dolores O'Reilly, and three older brothers, Gene, Brian and John.

         Joan Sibley, a fashion designer whose work is included in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 52.         The cause was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, said her husband, Peter Powell.         Ms. Sibley started her career in a small design studio she established on East 58th Street in Manhattan. She founded Sibley Coffee Ltd. with a fellow designer, Dory Coffee, in 1966. The company's popular silk jersey body dresses were sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and private customers included Jacqueline Onassis, Babe Paley and Candice Bergen.         Born in Gipsy, Pa., she attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and received a fellowship to travel and study in Europe, where she attended design classes at the Sorbonne.         Sibley Coffee was made a part of the Bendel's Studio Group in 1973 and closed in 1977. Ms. Sibley went on to work as associate designer for Ellen Tracy until 1980, when she left to work as a display designer and sales representative for Yale Burg, an antiques importing company in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband and a son, Gus Powell, who attends Oberlin College in Ohio.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Virginia Lee Bracker, a retired reporter and foreign correspondent for The New York Times, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She had been ill for a long time with a variety of ailments and her death was a suicide, said her friend and executor, Robert Riggs.         Mrs. Bracker was a women's-news reporter for The Washington Post who used the byline Virginia Lee Warren when she married Milton Bracker of The Times in 1936. They became a Times reporting team working in Italy, Mexico and Latin America and she retained her old byline throughout her career with The Times.         She left the staff in 1951 but shared a George Polk Award for foreign reporting with Mr. Bracker the next year for chronicling the repressive regime of Juan Domingo Peron in Argentina. Mr. Bracker died in his sleep in 1964 at 54 in Rome, where he was bureau chief.         His wife rejoined The Times that year in New York as a women's-news reporter. She retired as a reporter for the Family/Style department in 1978.         Born Virginia Lee Smith in Winchester, Va., Mrs. Bracker was hired by The Washington Post in 1933. She adopted the pen name Warren to avoid confusion with another reporter whose name was Smith.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Patricia Drylie, a dancer and an actress best known for her performance as a dancing waitress in the 1979 Michael Bennett musical "Ballroom," died on Nov. 11 at a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said Celia Tackaberry, a friend.         Ms. Drylie was born and reared in Toronto. At 18, she left for New York City to join the Radio City Ballet as a soloist. In 1950, George Balanchine cast her in his revival of "On Your Toes," and she later danced in "My Fair Lady."         She is survived by a sister, Margaret Bradley of Belleville, Ontario.         Patricia Drylie Dancer, 69       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980

Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Grace, Charm And Sophistication         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films. These are some of them.
