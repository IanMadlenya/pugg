Introduced International Designs         Most influential in the modern home furnishings field was Ms. Hoffman's introduction in 1975 of the furniture designs by Josef Hoffmann, the Viennese leader of the early 20th-century Wiener Werkstatte movement. The Hoffmann furniture designs were pivotal in the rediscovery and revival of many other early 20th-century classics and played a critical role in the current interest in this important period of 20th-century design.         A lamp Ms. Hoffman designed in 1969 was exhibited in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985.
