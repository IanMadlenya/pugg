         Pilar Barbosa de Rosario, a revered Puerto Rican historian and political authority who served as teacher, mentor and mother confessor to generations of Puerto Rican politicians, scholars and intellectuals, died on Wednesday at a hospital near her home in San Juan. She was 99 and widely regarded as the conscience of the ruling New Progressive Party.         In a career in which, in 1921, she became the first woman to teach at the University of Puerto Rico and later established the departments of history and social studies there, Dr. Barbosa became such an authority on Puerto Rican political history, from the movement for autonomy from Spain in the late 19th century to the drive for statehood in the 20th, that she was named the commonwealth's official historian in 1993.         It was a further reflection of her standing that after her death Gov. Pedro Rossello decreed a three-day period of mourning and that half a dozen members of the Legislature formed an honor guard at her coffin during a wake on Wednesday night.         The only reason a state funeral was not planned was that Dr. Barbosa had asked for private ceremonies, and as virtually any political figure in Puerto Rico would attest, Dr. Barbosa's wishes had long been treated as commands.         Indeed, long after she retired in 1967, Dr. Barbosa remained an influential figure in Puerto Rican politics -- a gregarious and vivacious woman with such a magnetic personality and wide-ranging knowledge of political history and current events that students, politicians and government officials trooped to her door for her counsel and her company.         ''It was an intellectual watering hole,'' said Gonzalo Cordova, a friend who began teaching history at the university the year she retired. ''You didn't come to drink, but for the conversation.''         To Kenneth McClintock, a 40-year-old member of the Puerto Rican Senate, her wealth of political and historical knowledge was understandable. ''As she was growing up,'' he said, ''history was made at her dining room table.''         Her father, Jose Celso Barbosa, was the founder of the Puerto Rican statehood movement and the precursor of the New Progressive Party, which has continued to embrace his ideals -- as modified over the years, to be sure, by his daughter, who insisted that the party of statehood also commit itself to social justice.         This, too, was a tribute to the legacy of her father. He was a black man who was so outraged at being denied higher education by the Spanish that after graduating first in his class at the University of Michigan medical school in 1882 -- and even then allowed to practice in Puerto Rico only after the intervention of the American consul in San Juan -- that he became a leader of the autonomy movement.         Having found a measure of racial and civil justice in 19th-century America after the United States displaced the Spanish in 1898, he espoused statehood as the best way to guarantee similar rights in Puerto Rico.         As one of his 12 children, Dr. Barbosa, whose mother died when she was a toddler, inherited her father's intelligence and his ideals. When she began teaching at the University of Puerto Rico in 1921 she was still an undergraduate herself, and the university was little more than a teacher's college.         After graduating in 1924, she moved on to Clark University in Worcester, Mass., receiving a master's in 1925 and a doctorate the next year.         Over the next decades Dr. Barbosa researched and wrote numerous books, pamphlets and papers on Puerto Rican political history, some based on her father's papers.         Partly, perhaps, because she and her husband, Jose Ezequiel Rosario, an economics professor who died in 1963, had no children, Dr. Barbosa began receiving her students for informal consultations on Saturday afternoons.         The sessions, which began in the days she lived in a farmhouse on the outskirts of San Juan, were continued after she retired and moved to a condominium in the city's Santurce section, but with a difference.         Because she no longer had a teaching load to keep her busy during the week, her proteges took to calling on her any day of the week.         By the time many of them had risen to high positions in the government, Dr. Barbosa, who also maintained friendly relationships with members of other parties, had acquired so much influence that she operated almost as a political boss -- a boss who seemed so blind to her own power that she may not have realized that an off-hand criticism delivered in a private conversation would soon be altering party policy.         Dr. Barbosa is survived by a brother, Rafael Barbosa, of Carolina, P.R.       
         Harriet Pratt Morris, a leader in the movement against the death penalty in Georgia and nationwide, died on Sunday at her home in Atlanta. Mrs. Morris, who was known as Patsy, was 66.         Her husband, the Rev. John B. Morris, said she died of lung cancer.         For some 20 years, first with the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia and after 1987 at the Georgia Appellate Practice and Educational Research Center in Atlanta, Mrs. Morris worked to find legal representation for death row inmates.         She was among the first to document that the likelihood of receiving the death penalty for a murder conviction depended in large part on the race and social status of the victim and the county where the crime took place.         Mrs. Morris's efforts not only earned the gratitude of prisoners spared capital punishment, but also inspired many lawyers to devote their practices to opposing the death penalty. Her work served as a model for those outside the courts as well.         ''Both of us are enormously and extremely opposed to the state killing people,'' Mr. Morris said yesterday. ''We don't believe that the death penalty acts as a deterrent.         Mrs. Morris honed her social conscience in the turbulent South of the 1950's and 60's, during the early days of school desegregation and of passive civil rights protests that were often met by violence.         ''My views on capital punishment have been shaped by my life,'' she  once wrote.         When the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to be reinstated in 1976, Mrs. Morris began to monitor prisoners under sentence of death, trying to find counsel for them. Good-natured but firm, she pressed lawyers in Georgia and elsewhere to accept these cases without fee.         Mrs. Morris was a great-granddaughter of Charles Pratt, a co-founder of Standard Oil and a founder of the Pratt Institute. A daughter of H. Irving Pratt and Ellen H. Pratt, she was born in Manhattan and reared in Glen Cove and Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Morris graduated from Vassar College, where she studied childhood education, in 1952. Later that year, she married Mr. Morris.         The couple moved to the Deep South in 1954, when Mr. Morris was appointed a vicar in Dillon, S.C.         At the end of 1958, they moved to Atlanta, where Mr. Morris became the executive director of the newly formed Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity, a group that supported the civil rights movement and addressed segregation within the Episcopal Church.         Later, the couple helped found the Georgia chapter of the A.C.L.U.         In addition to her husband and her mother, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Pratt is survived by two daughters, Anne B. Morris of Southampton, Mass., and Ellen Morris McCann of Lincoln, Mass.; two sons, Christopher W. Morris of Haverford, Pa., and John B. Morris Jr. of Washington; two sisters, Margaret Cardoza of Brookline, Mass., and Ellen Stoia of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Marie M. Lambert, who campaigned for Manhattan Surrogate promising to ''clean up the citadel of patronage'' but who retired from the powerful judgeship 12 years later best known as a patronage queen, died on Tuesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan, where she practiced law.         The cause was kidney failure, said her son, Gregory L. Lambert. Her health had deteriorated after heart surgery last fall, he said.         As one of two elected judges of the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, which Fiorello La Guardia described  as ''the most expensive undertaking establishment in the world,'' Surrogate Lambert heard disputes pertaining to wills and estates, and formalized adoptions. She directed the flow of millions of dollars a year by appointing guardians for those too young or too feeble to handle their accounts, designating lawyers to manage wills that had no assigned executor, and awarding legal fees.         From 1977, when she was elected, to 1990, when she retired at the mandatory age of 70, Surrogate Lambert, feared for her quick temper and ability to keep lawyers working in her court till the early morning hours, drew fire.         Democratic Party leaders would not endorse her in the primary campaign, saying she lacked judicial temperament and knowledge of trust and estates law. A judicial conduct commission investigated allegations that she was the most hands-on of fund-raisers for the primary, in which she sent out 300,000 pieces of literature and saturated the city with Lambert paraphernalia. The United States Attorney's office would periodically announce that it was looking at how she gave lucrative work to a cadre of lawyers.         But while shadows remained attached to her name, Surrogate Lambert, a gregarious, street-smart personal injury lawyer who was also the first woman president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, eluded her accusers. Despite the absence of party backing and the disdain of the city's editorial pages, she ran a raw and raucous campaign -- and won. Although investigators recommended she be censured for her unabashed fund-raising, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct declined to take action. And though two lawyers would be prosecuted for activities connected to her, she never faced any charges.         In 1990, an appellate court scolded her as it overturned legal fees she awarded to two lawyers, saying the fees were excessive and that the Surrogate had failed to disclose her friendship with them.         As Surrogate, she ruled over the dying wishes of the very rich and the very famous, a role she relished. Marilyn Monroe's estate marched before her, as did those of Lotte Lenya, Yul Brynner, Lillian Hellman and Joan Crawford. ''Relax,'' she told the actor Al Pacino, when he appeared on a matter. ''Nobody is going to bite you, not if I can help it.''         She was regarded as a judge who could compel rancorous cases to settle by sheer dint of her will. ''If she wanted that result, she would get that result -- legal niceties didn't bother her,'' George DeSipio, a former chairman of the city bar's trust and estates committee, recalled. ''She could be quite nasty if you crossed her the wrong way.''         But Mr. DeSipio, who remained on friendly terms with Surrogate Lambert, said that above all, she was passionate about her job. ''She was a happy judge,'' he said.         In her capacity as Surrogate, she used her authority to help gay partners clarify their inheritance rights. Since homosexuals were not permitted to marry, Surrogate Lambert permitted one partner to adopt the other as a means of guaranteeing inheritance benefits.         But her most infamous task was settling the war over the half-billion dollar estate of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. For four months in 1986, Surrogate Lambert presided over the trial pitting Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his one-time maid and third wife, to whom he had left his estate, and his six children by two former wives.         According to David Margolick, a former reporter for The New York Times who chronicled the case in his book ''Undue Influence,'' Surrogate Lambert badgered and belittled Mrs. Johnson and her lawyers, provoking her to settle the case before it went to a jury.         In another case that raised eyebrows and grabbed headlines, Surrogate Lambert, an Italian immigrant who aggressively sought the support of Jewish voters by vowing not to direct funds to banks that joined in the Arab boycott of Israel, opened an investigation into the Palestine Liberation Organization. A journalist had left 10 percent of his $300,000 estate to the P.L.O. Surrogate Lambert said she could authorize payment to a terrorist group. After hearings in 1982, she ordered the money to be administered through the International Red Cross, to address Palestinian living conditions.         Giusippina Giovanna Maria Macri was born in a small town in the Calabria region of Italy in 1920. Her family settled in Brooklyn nine months later, where her father found work as a barber and her mother as a seamstress. She is survived by her sister, Gloria Diemer, and her brother, Charles Courtright.         She showed intellectual promise and ambition at an early age: Embedded in the family lore is the tale of how the young Marie, told by her grammar school that she could not be valedictorian although she had the academic credentials, hopped the subway, went to City Hall, and had an audience with an Italian compatriot, Mayor La Guardia, who immediately ordered the wrong rectified.         After graduating from Brooklyn College, she attended New York University Law School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1946 she married Grady Lambert, a salesman at Abercrombie & Fitch, who died in 1975.         She tried Wall Street law firms, but left because she was told to specialize in trust and estates law, which she considered ''women's work.'' Instead, she made her mark in the male-dominated world of personal injury law. Hungry and bright, she would take negligence cases that no one else would touch and turn them into winners. Her courtroom manner was disarming: She would shuffle in, legal papers spilling out of shopping bags. Juries considered her one of them.         From the outset of her legal career, she understood the importance of networking: In her later years, she would boast of her friendship with Roy Cohn, who escorted her to President Ronald Reagan's first inaugural ball.         In 1974, the New York State Trial Lawyers elected her president. ''She started her career and ended it on behalf of widows and orphans,'' said Aaron J. Broder, a personal injury lawyer.         In 1990, she reached 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges, and returned to private practice reluctantly. There is a Lambert legend  widely repeated in legal circles, which her son could not confirm but said could well be true. In an effort to extend her term on the bench, it is said, Surrogate Lambert traveled to Italy to check her village church records, to see if her birth date was perhaps incorrect.         Correction:  March 30, 1997, Sunday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Marie M. Lambert, a Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan, omitted a word and thus misstated her position in a case involving a bequest to the Palestine Liberation Organization. She ordered hearings into the purpose of the organization because she said she could not authorize estate payments to terrorists. (The obituary is reprinted today on page 25.)

         Judi Bari, an environmentalist whose passionate defense of the California redwoods earned her national prominence and who was injured in a car bombing that might have been related to her protests, died on Sunday at her cabin home in Willits, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bari emerged on the national scene in the summer of 1990. Working with the radical environmental group Earth First, she helped organize a seasonlong campaign of protests to stop the logging of Northern California's old-growth forests.         She and other Earth First members, some outfitted in spotted-owl costumes and camouflage, spent weeks chaining themselves to redwoods and pleading with loggers to spare the groves. In the process, Ms. Bari, a confident orator, helped present a coherent message for a group with a reputation as an overzealous fringe organization.         She called on college students statewide to join the protests, evoking the civil rights spirit that had been used in the summer of 1964 to draw student protesters to the South.         As tensions rose between protesters and loggers, Ms. Bari emerged as a more moderate voice on the environmentalist side. She emphasized that protests opposed the actions of corporations, not their employees, and renounced the use of sabotage methods like ''spiking'' trees with ten-inch nails to destroy saws, which had seriously injured at least one millworker.         Her outspokenness earned her the scorn of many lumber workers, and she received several anonymous death threats.         In May 1990, an explosion ripped through Ms. Bari's car as she and Darryl Cherney, a fellow Earth First member, drove through Oakland, Calif., shortly before planned anti-logging protests. The blast, later determined to have been caused by a nail bomb under the driver's seat, shattered Ms. Bari's pelvis and lower back and left her permanently disabled. Mr. Cherney's injuries were minor.         Shortly after the explosion, while Ms. Bari was still in the hospital, the F.B.I. and local law-enforcement officials put Ms. Bari and Mr. Cherney under arrest, saying they suspected the two had built the bomb. Supporters of the two contended that either the timber industry or Government officials were responsible.         Two months later, the authorities announced that Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari would not be charged with the bombing. They later filed suit against the Government claiming false arrest and civil rights violations. That suit is still in progress in Oakland, Calif.         Ms. Bari was born in Baltimore in 1949. In the late 1960's, as a student at the University of Maryland, she became involved in protests against the Vietnam War and left school.         In the next decade, Ms. Bari held a variety of jobs in the Washington area, where she was also a labor organizer. In the mid-1970's, she planned a successful wildcat strike of workers at a bulk mail office of the United States Postal Service in Washington, as well as failed effort to unionize grocery clerks.         In 1979, she relocated to Northern California, where she worked as a carpenter.         In interviews after the bombing, she recounted how she had a ''environmental epiphany'' one day while working. Admiring a piece of knot-free siding for a house, she said, she wondered aloud whether the wood was old-growth redwood. Her supervisor blithely said it was from a redwood about 1,000 years old.         ''A light bulb went on: We are cutting down old-growth forests to make yuppie houses,'' she said. ''I became obsessed with the forests.''         Ms. Bari is survived by her daughters, Lisa, 16, and Jessica, 11; her parents, Arthur and Ruth Bari, of Silver Spring, Md., and two sisters, Gina Kolata, of Princeton, N.J., a reporter at The New York Times, and Martha Bari of Silver Spring.       
         Leanne Katz, who served as executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship since its creation more than 20 years ago, died at her New York home Sunday, after a three-year battle with cancer. She was 65.         As a defender of free speech, Ms. Katz worked with teachers, librarians and authors across the country to fight the banning of books, magazines, movies and art.         Ms. Katz worked on dozens of cases each year in which principals or school boards had removed books from classrooms or libraries because they disapproved of the content. Among the authors whose works Ms. Katz defended -- sometimes repeatedly -- are Judy Blume, Maurice Sendak, Nancy Friday, V. C. Andrews, Katherine Paterson, Ken Follett, Madeleine L'Engle, Chris Durang, Dorothy Allison and Robert Cormier -- in addition to Mark Twain and Geoffrey Chaucer.         Ms. Blume, a popular children's author whose books dealing frankly with adolescent sexuality have frequently been the targets of censorship, said: ''When my books were being banned early on, in the 80's, I had nowhere to go, until I found this remarkable woman, this tiny dynamo who had such passion and energy for fighting censorship. From then on, if I had word from a teacher, a librarian, or a newspaper anywhere in the country that something was being banned, all I had to do was put this person in touch with Leanne, and I knew she would instantly respond and get them through this, let them know they were not alone. She believed in the First Amendment above all.''         Recently, Ms. Blume said, Ms. Katz had been distressed about what seemed to be an increasing tendency not just to remove controversial books from use, but to dismiss the teacher or librarian who chose them.         The coalition Ms. Katz headed was created in 1974, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Miller v. California, which broadened the reach of censorship, allowing the banning of any work that lacked ''serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.''         The coalition is an alliance of 45 religious, artistic, educational and civil liberties groups ranging from Actors' Equity to the American Library Association and the National Council of the Churches of Christ, and it began as a project of the American Civil Liberties Union, but soon became a separate entity.         The coalition acted as an advocate against proposed legislation, national or local, that would restrict free speech. Roz Udow, the coalition's director of education and public affairs, said it worked on more than a hundred individual cases a year, most of them involving efforts to ban works because their content is considered sexual, profane -- as is becoming increasingly common -- a reference to Satan.         ''There isn't a book in the library that somebody hasn't tried to censor,'' Ms. Udow said. ''There have always been a lot of cases about sexual content, and currently the major topics of concern seem to be homosexuality, witchcraft and the occult.''         Throughout the 1990's, Ms. Katz has been a central figure in the debate over whether pornography harms women. Some feminists, including Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, believe that pornography is inextricably connected to discrimination and violence against women, but Ms. Katz organized other leading feminists to argue that free expression about sexuality is a feminist value and that censorship has harmed women in the past by suppressing information about sexuality and birth control.         Before she began working with the censorship coalition, Ms. Katz was on the national staff of the American Civil Liberties Union, as liaison to the group's affiliates. Ms. Katz served as a consultant for Human Rights Watch, the National Council of Teachers of English and the Modern Language Association. She taught courses on free expression at Queens College of the City University of New York and the New School of Social Research, and wrote and lectured widely on freedom of expression.         She is survived by her husband, Alvin M. Katz, her sons, Joseph and Jamie, and her sister Sara Blackburn.         A memorial service will be held at a date to be announced.       
         Ruth Clark, a pollster who left her mark on the newspaper industry with a landmark newspaper study that encouraged editors to offer more information that readers could use in their daily lives and who helped define changing American attitudes on issues from the political to the personal, died on Feb. 20 in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Andrew.         The newspaper study ''Changing Needs of Changing Readers,'' published in 1979, had ''an electrifying effect on the news business,'' said Lee Stinnett, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which commissioned it in an effort to assess why circulation was declining.         The concept, which came to be called ''news you can use,'' appealed to editors nationwide as they experimented with reports on family issues and other articles of a type that they began to refer to as soft news.         Mrs. Clark was also widely known for directing many of the surveys that defined American public opinion during a time of great social and political turmoil in the 1970's, and she was part of the team that introduced exit polls into American politics and journalism.         She had no formal training in marketing or polling. She learned the business on her own, starting as a door-to-door questioner and gradually rising as a survey designer for marketing companies and eventually to prominent positions in the industry. She was a vice president at Louis Harris & Associates in the 1960's, and she was a senior vice president at Yankelovich, Skelly & White until 1983, when she left to start her own firm, Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo.         Arthur H. White, vice chairman of Yankelovich Partners, said that in her surveys Mrs. Clark always made sure she included the opinions of all segments of American society, not just those of the economically comfortable or affluent, because of her  concerns for the downtrodden.         Born Ruth Fine in New York City, Mrs. Clark graduated from Hunter College in 1936. The following year, she married Joseph Clark, who later became the foreign editor of The Daily Worker.         The Clarks moved to the Soviet Union in 1950 but became disillusioned with what they saw there, returning to the United States in 1953, Andrew Clark said. Mr. Clark publicly renounced the Soviet system and left The Daily Worker in 1957.         Mrs. Clark entered the field of market research as an interviewer, going door to door and asking opinions about commercial products, often accompanied by her infant son.         But in 1960, she was ready to move up. She obtained a job with Lou Harris that kept her in the marketing survey segment of the business at first. In 1964, she was part of the Harris team that conducted an exit poll for CBS News in the tightly contested California Republican primary between Nelson A. Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater.         On the basis of the poll's results, Mr. Harris called the race for Mr. Goldwater. He said the two next weeks until the official vote tallies were complete was ''the loneliest time of my entire political career.'' But the official results proved the Harris team right.         Mrs. Clark got a chance to address political issues more broadly when she moved to Yankelovich, Skelly & White around 1970. She was in charge of the firm's public opinion research, and she proved to be adept at turning out high-quality surveys that newspapers and magazines could get into print quickly, Mr. White said.         A survey for the American Cancer Society helped persuade the organization to focus on encouraging nonsmokers to stand up for their rights, said John H. Bartolomeo, a partner in her firm, who also worked with her in the 1970's.         ''She told them that she had picked up an undercurrent of militancy among nonsmokers,'' Mr. Bartolomeo said, ''and she told them that the most important thing they could do would be to encourage that militancy.''         He said that Mrs. Clark, who did not smoke, ''told me once that she considered that the most important thing she had ever done.''         In 1983, Mrs. Clark's daughter Judith, who was in the radical Weather Underground, was convicted of helping to rob a Brink's armored car in Rockland County, N.Y. In that incident in 1981 two police officers and a guard were killed. Judith Clark was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.         At Yankelovich and at Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo, Mrs. Clark conducted market surveys for many media companies, including The New York Times, The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune.         ''Changing Needs of Changing Readers,'' which Mrs. Clark updated in 1984, was a small study but it helped to change an industry, Mr. Stinnett said. Her influence on newspapers can be seen today in the creation of life style sections, consumer news and entertainment guides published by many newspapers as well as lists of resources for readers that often accompany feature articles.         Besides her son, of Portland, Ore., and her daughter, Mrs. Clark is survived by four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1988.       
         Laura Nyro, the New York-born singer and songwriter whose impassioned, iconoclastic music exploded pop song conventions in a feverish search for emotional truth, died on Tuesday at her home in Danbury, Conn. She was 49.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Elizabeth Rush, her business representative.         Along with Joni Mitchell, Ms. Nyro (pronounced Nero) was a pioneer in the confessional, free-form school of songwriting that grew out of 1960's folk music, especially the work of Bob Dylan. A trained pianist, she had a kaleidoscopic musical sensibility that fused elements of folk, soul, gospel and Broadway tradition into intensely introspective songs that transcended easy stylistic categorization.         With her uninhibited, note-bending vocal wail, she also helped introduce the rhythm-and-blues-influenced style known as ''blue-eyed soul,'' so named because it was popularized by white singers imitating black role models. And her live concerts were fervent affairs in which the dark-haired, dark-eyed singer, exotically gowned and surrounded by roses, performed with a transported intensity.         As a recording artist, Ms. Nyro never had a gold album or a hit single, but many of her songs were hits for others. And her albums, especially her 1968 song suite ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession'' (Columbia), a sometimes impenetrable mosaic of fragments, reflections and fantasies with a Southern gospel feel,  was one of the most influential pop recordings of the late 1960's. Among the many artists inspired by Ms. Nyro's eclecticism and poetic sensibility were Rickie Lee Jones, Kate Bush, Wendy Waldman, Jane Siberry, Teena Marie, Suzanne Vega,  Toni Childs, Tori Amos and Paula Cole.         Among Ms. Nyro's biggest hits for others were the songs ''And When I Die'' (recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary and Blood, Sweat and Tears),  ''Wedding Bell Blues'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Sweet Blindness'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Stoned Soul Picnic'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Eli's Coming'' (Three Dog Night) and ''Stoney End'' (Barbra Streisand).         Ms. Nyro was born Laura Nigro in the Bronx on Oct. 18, 1947. Her father was a jazz trumpeter who practiced for hours at home. An undisciplined child prodigy, Ms. Nyro began writing songs at age 8 and later attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. As a teen-ager she experimented with psychedelic drugs, absorbed musical influences as far-ranging as Bob Dylan, John Coltrane and Debussy, and at 18 made her  first extended club appearance at the Hungry i coffeehouse in San Francisco.         In 1966, Verve/Folkways released her debut album, ''More Than a New Discovery,'' a remarkably sophisticated collection of original songs that Columbia later purchased and reissued in 1973 as ''The First Songs.'' Widely admired, it led to an invitation to perform at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, where her introspective music proved so out of place amid the high-powered rock of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin that she was shouted off the stage.         Within the year, however, several of Ms. Nyro's songs had become hits for others, and she was signed by Columbia. In March 1968, the label released ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession,'' her autobiographical album about a young woman's spiritual journey from childhood to maturity. With its abrupt changes of tempo and style and its fiercely emotional singing, the record was unlike anything that had been heard in pop music, and it laid the groundwork for a female-dominated genre of quirky, reflective songwriting that continues to this day.         On her next two albums, ''New York Tendaberry'' (1969) and ''Christmas and the Beads of Sweat'' (1970), Ms. Nyro retreated somewhat from the boundary-breaking experimentalism of ''Eli'' and settled into her characteristic style, which remained eclectic but had its strongest roots in the Philadelphia pop-soul sound of songwriters like Thom Bell, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, and Todd Rundgren. Her 1971 album, ''Gonna Take a Miracle,'' a collaboration with the rhythm-and-blues group LaBelle, was a tribute to New York street music of an earlier era that featured  jubilant remakes of old doo-wop and Motown favorites.         Never comfortable in the limelight, Ms. Nyro married and retreated from the music business to lead a secluded life for the next three years in a fishing village in Massachusetts. After the marriage ended in divorce, she returned to recording, putting out ''Smile'' (1976), her first album in four years. Here, and in her later  Columbia albums, ''Nested'' (1978), ''Mother's Spiritual'' (1984) and ''Walk the Dog and Light the Light'' (1993), her songs gave increasingly direct expression to the pantheism that had always lurked in her writing. But if her later songs exalted pacifism, feminism, motherhood and animal rights, the emotional turmoil of old was never far from the surface.         Ms. Nyro personally selected all 34 of the songs on a recently released two-disk retrospective of her work, ''The Best of Laura Nyro: Stoned Soul Picnic'' (Columbia/Legacy).         She is survived by a son, Gil Bianchini, and her companion, Maria Desiderio.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Queen Mother Moore, a civil rights worker and black nationalist, died on Friday in a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 98 and a longtime resident of Harlem.         Miss Moore, whose real name was Audley Moore, was a hero to many residents of Harlem, where she worked with Marcus Garvey, the Jamaican-born black nationalist leader, and his Back-to-Africa movement. She was also an advocate of reparations for slavery, tenants' rights and education for the poor.         Howard Dodson, the head of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, in Harlem, said in 1995 that her career constituted ''a link between the best elements of the nationalist and radical left political traditions in Harlem over the past five, six decades.''         Miss Moore came to be called Queen Mother during a trip to Africa years ago, when a tribe in Ghana awarded her the honorary title. In Africa, as she once put it, ''I felt the lash on the backs of my people.''         Her outrage over the suffering of blacks in America led to years of political action. ''They not only called us Negroes, they made us Negroes,'' she once said, ''things that don't know where they came from and don't even care that they don't know. Negro is a state of mind, and they massacred our minds.''         Audley Eloise Moore was born in New Iberia, La., a town west of New Orleans. Her family's past reflected the racism she fought: one of her grandfathers was lynched, and one of her grandmothers, a slave, was raped by a white man.         Miss Moore's parents died when she was young, and she dropped out of school, becoming a hairdresser. Largely self-educated, she was inspired by the writings of Frederick Douglass and by Garvey's oratory, which she first heard in New Orleans. She was also fond of Nelson Mandela's dictum, ''The struggle is my life.''         Stirred by Garvey's pride in blacks' African heritage, Miss Moore and her two sisters went to Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. There, she married Frank Warner.         In Harlem, Miss Moore became prominent in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the organization Garvey founded in 1914.         Beginning in the 1960's, Miss Moore was among black leaders demanding reparations from the United States Government for the sufferings of blacks under slavery. In 1994, she addressed a conference in Detroit of the the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, where she declared, in a voice gone soft and husky with age: ''Reparations. Reparations. Keep on. Keep on. We've got to win.''         In 1966, Miss Moore was among parents and civil rights workers who staged a sit-in in the Board of Education's meeting hall in Brooklyn, where the protesters accused board members of neglecting the needs of schools in poor neighborhoods.         Miss Moore said of the district superintendents: ''Run them out. They're perpetuating idiot factories among us.''         In 1989, Miss Moore and more than 40 other prominent black women were honored at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, in Washington, where ''I Dream a World,'' an exhibition of photographs of them by Brian Lanker, was on display.         ''These women are bound by their grit and unquenchable spirit,'' Marion Wright Edelman, a civil rights lawyer and the executive director of the Children's Defense fund, said at the show. ''They lifted the veil of impossibility despite the barriers of race and sex.''         Miss Moore's husband died in 1967. She is survived by a son, Thomas O. Warner of Philadelphia, five grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Florence M. Kelley, the first administrative judge of the modern Family Court in New York City and an advocate for the legal rights of the poor, died last Saturday at her home in Little Compton, R.I. She was 85.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, David S. Worgan, a retired executive assistant district attorney of New York County.         Judge Kelley presided over the notoriously overworked court during an era of great reform. In 1960, she became the first woman to be chief judge of what was then the Domestic Relations Court of New York City.         ''Florence and I went to Yale Law School together,'' said Mayor Robert F. Wagner when he appointed her. ''She's moved further than I -- and done much better.''         In 1962, when the court was reconfigured as the new Family Court of the State of New York, within the City of New York, with jurisdiction over a range of social problems, she became administrative judge.         A slim, gracious woman, Judge Kelley was ladylike in her manner but decisive and stubborn in her role as a visionary administrator. Then as now, the Family Court, regarded as the stepchild of the system, was criticized for its sprawling caseload. Judge Kelley pressed for more judges, psychiatric evaluations for clients and probation services for juveniles.         Her dedication to legal and social services for the poor was a family heritage: her grandmother, for whom she was named, was one of the first women lawyers in the country and the founder of the National Consumers League, an advocates' group for which Judge Kelley worked.         Born in Manhattan, Judge Kelley graduated from Smith College and Yale Law School.         In the 1930's and 40's, women prosecutors were a a rare sight in the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, where Judge Kelley worked under Thomas E. Dewey and Frank S. Hogan. She next turned to the private sector, spending a few years in a Wall Street law firm. But in 1947, she returned to public life as the attorney in charge of the criminal branch of the Legal Aid Society, where she spent 13 years.         She managed to maintain her sense of humor. Illustrating the heavy caseload of lawyers for the indigent, she told how she introduced herself to a new client in the city's detention pen by saying hesitantly, ''You're the man who robbed the delicatessen.''         He demurred. ''No ma'am,'' he said helpfully, ''I'm the one who pushed the woman out of the 13th-story window.''         In 1970, Judge Kelley became a trial judge of the Supreme Court of New York, serving until her retirement in 1980.         But retirement was a relative term for a woman who was also president of the Women's City Club and a member of foundations dedicated to the poor and the mentally ill. She and her husband moved to Little Compton, where she served on the town planning board and helped raise money for the Sakonnet Light House, which was relighted in March.         In addition to her husband of 44 years, her survivors include her brothers, Augustus M. Kelley and Nicholas Kelley Jr.       
         Sue Sumii, a fiery human rights campaigner whose landmark novel sold 8.3 million copies and helped change attitudes toward Japan's ''untouchables,'' died last Monday. She was 95.         Mrs. Sumii's greatest literary and social accomplishment was ''The River With No Bridge,'' a multivolume novel exploring the humiliations endured by outcasts known as burakumin. The first volume was published in 1958, and she was working on the eighth volume at the time of her death.         Mrs. Sumii fought all her life for women's rights, for social equality, and in particular for equal opportunities for the burakumin, often called the ''untouchables'' of Japan.         The protagonist in ''The River With No Bridge'' is a burakumin early in the century in a rural area in Japan. He lives in the burakumin slum, separated from the main town by a river, and becomes a community leader after encountering the abuse and discrimination that were routine for burakumin in those days.         Mrs. Sumii described his traumas so vividly that she shamed many of her fellow Japanese into looking seriously at the discrimination suffered by burakumin in modern Japan, and her novel and the three films made of it helped create empathy for their plight.         In one particularly poignant scene that was redolent of the contempt that burakumin used to be taught to feel for themselves, a young burakumin woman fears she is pregnant and then is relieved that she is not -- because her baby would be a filthy burakumin.         The books and movies were particularly powerful because they were almost the only presentation of the burakumin's plight in Japan. Even the word ''burakumin'' is a taboo, almost never mentioned in the press or on television, and so some Japanese came to see the burakumin almost entirely through the lens of Mrs. Sumii.         Mrs. Sumii was not herself a burakumin, but she grew up in a region of western Japan with many burakumin communities. The burakumin are descendants of outcasts who traditionally worked in occupations regarded as unclean, such as slaughtering animals and tanning leather.         Although they are not a racial minority but an occupational one, and they look the same as any other Japanese, the burakumin have faced enormous difficulties getting married, getting jobs, and moving out of their own communities.         Some discrimination remains, and burakumin families still earn only 60 percent on average as much as other Japanese households. But over all Japan has made enormous strides in the last two decades in improving the social status of the burakumin. One sign of the progress is that now 73 percent of burakumin marry non-burakumin.         Because the issue of the burakumin is such a taboo, it was an extraordinary step to write a novel in which they are the heroes. The whole topic traditionally was regarded in Japan as unsavory and embarrassing.         Mrs. Sumii was born Jan. 7, 1902, near the historic city of Nara. She once said that her rebelliousness against traditional values developed after the Meiji Emperor visited Nara when she was 6 years old, and she saw an old farmer recover some imperial excrement from a toilet that the Emperor had used.         ''There is nothing more gracious than this,'' the old farmer said worshipfully, according to Mrs. Sumii's account, and she decided that this reverence was so ridiculous that her country had serious problems that she wanted to work to address.         She worked briefly as a journalist, but then resigned to protest discrimination against women. After marrying a writer named Shigeru Inuta, Mrs. Sumii wrote novels and children's stories, campaigned for equal rights and social issues, raised four children, and worked on the family's farm.         Mr. Inuta died in 1957. Mrs. Sumii is survived by her children, including a son who is a university professor and a daughter who is a journalist and author.         Despite the grace of her writing -- which comes through in the one-volume English translation of ''The River With No Bridge,'' published in 1990 by Charles E. Tuttle Co. -- Mrs. Sumii always saw her books as more of a social effort than a literary project.         ''I will keep writing as long as I live,'' she once said. ''This is my own war against human stupidity.''       
         Joan Daves, a leading literary agent whose client list included six Nobel Prize winners, died on Wednesday at her home in Bedford, N.Y. Ms. Davis, who also had a home in Manhattan, was 77.         Her husband, Joe H. Kirchberger, said the cause was an acute asthmatic attack.         For decades, Ms. Daves was regarded as one of the world's foremost agents for serious and intellectual fiction and nonfiction. Her Nobel Prize-winning clients included Heinrich Boll (1972), Elias Canetti (1981), Herman Hesse (1946), the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1964), Nelly Sachs (1966) and Gabriela Mistral (1945). All but Dr. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and took Ms. Daves with him to Stockholm when he received the award, were laureates in literature.         Ms. Daves (pronounced DAY-vis) also represented such renowned authors as Frank O'Connor, Isaac Babel, Vaclav Havel and Rachel Carson, the trailblazing environmentalist who wrote ''Silent Spring'' and ''The Sea Around Us.''         ''She loved these authors, which conjures up another world; it wasn't the fast buck,'' said Jennifer Lyons, who became her associate when Ms. Daves affiliated her one-woman agency in 1987 with a larger Manhattan agency, Writers House, to secure the interests of her authors as she grew older. ''There was a real passion for authors themselves, for artists and for literature that is rare today.''         Robert Weil, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, recalled that Ms. Daves became familiar with Dr. King in the early 1950's before he achieved national prominence while leading the 1955 boycott of the segregated transit system in Montgomery, Ala.         Mr. Weil said Ms. Daves told a friend that there was an extremely articulate, charismatic and visionary minister from the South she had to meet. ''She could spot very early people's genius and people's talent,'' Mr. Weil said. ''She also sided with the underdog.''         In addition, Mr. Weil said: ''She was literature. She was a brilliant critic, a brilliant reader. She was extremely nurturing. She had a social flair as well. She was a great person to put together people as if she ran a salon in New York which combined the writers of post-World War II European literature with the needs of American publishers.''         In the sale of American rights, the Joan Daves Agency also represented a number of distinguished foreign publishers, like Kinderbuch Verlag of Switzerland, the German concerns Carl Hanser Verlag of Munich and Verlag Kipenheuer und Witsch of Cologne, and the Austrian concern Residenz Verlag of Salzburg.         Ms. Daves, who was later to Americanize her name, was born in Berlin in 1919 and grew up as Liselotte Davidson. She was the middle child and younger daughter of a Jewish banker who was to die in Auschwitz.         In the mid-1930's after the Nazis came to power, her father sent her to Paris, where she became fluent in French. She was forced to return to Berlin when the Nazis imposed currency restrictions on Jews, but she reached Britain in 1938 and followed her sister to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City.         An avid reader who was always interested in books, she worked for a couple of years for Interscience Publishers, publishers of scientific books and books by refugees. In 1942, she went to work as an editor for Harper & Brothers, where she started the Harper's Art Library, which issued books about Durer and Flemish and French master drawings.         In the early 1950's she established the Joan Daves Agency and used her European connections to attract the Continent's foremost writers.         Besides her husband, Ms. Daves is survived by a brother, Peter Davidson of Las Vegas.         In 1992, in ceremonies at the consulate in Manhattan, Ms. Daves was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in recognition of a lifetime of advancement of German culture and literature.       
         Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious, a Chicago lawyer who held high posts in the Nixon and Bush Administrations, was active in the civil rights movement and was on the boards of major corporations, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 75.         The cause of death was breast cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a Republican, was known as Jewel S. Lafontant when she served in the Nixon and Bush Administrations. Prior to that, President Richard M. Nixon had appointed her to the Justice Department as Deputy Solicitor General -- the first woman and the first black person to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office.  She held that post from 1973 to 1975. Under President George Bush, from 1989 to 1993, she was in the State Department with the concurrent titles of ambassador-at-large and coordinator of refugee affairs.         In the civil rights field, she was a founding member of the Congress of Racial Equality, an officer of the Chicago chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. During the early 1940's, The Chicago Sun-Times reported yesterday, ''She brought change to the city by participating in sit-ins at Loop restaurants.'' In a 1991 interview, she recalled, ''Often we were spat upon and physically abused.''         Times changed, and from 1965 to 1967 she was on the President's Council on Minority Business Enterprise. In the early 1970's Ebony magazine named her one of the 100 most influential black Americans.         The corporate boards she was on over the years included those of the Mobil Corporation, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Trans World Airlines, Revlon, Inc., Harte-Hanks Communications, the Hanes Corporation and the Bendix Corporation         During her career, she was also a director of nonprofit institutions including Oberlin College, Howard University and Tuskegee Institute. And she received numerous awards and honorary degrees.         At her death she was a partner in the Chicago law firm of Holleb & Coff, which she joined in 1993. Her law practice, in her years there, was concentrated in the areas of corporate law, labor and employment law, and governmental and international relations.         Jewel Stradford was born in Chicago, the daughter of C. Francis Stradford -- a lawyer -- and Aida Arabella Cartera, and grew up there. She graduated in 1943 from Oberlin College and received a law degree in 1946 from the University of Chicago.         But afterward, The Sun-Times reported, she could not obtain office space, no major white law firm would employ her, and the Chigago Bar Association would not admit her as a member. In 1947, she went to work in the legal aid bureau of a charitable organization, before going on to work for a succession of Chicago law firms and doing much trial work.         During the Eisenhower Administration, from 1955 to 1958, she served as assistant United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1960, she seconded the nomination of Mr. Nixon as Republican candidate for President, but he was defeated by John F. Kennedy.         As the Bush Administration's coordinator for refugee affairs, she dealt with a staggering variety of problems. In 1989, when Moscow was permitting record numbers of Soviet Jews and Pentecostals to leave its soil, she declared that the Bush Adminstration wanted to ''get control over the flow'' of emigres. In 1990, she went to London and reaffirmed a Bush Administration pledge that the United States would help to settle half of all new Vietnamese boat people -- refugees who fled their country by sea and mostly went to camps in the British crown colony of Hong Kong.         In the same year, she went to the African nation of Malawi, which had been flooded with refugees from a civil war in neighboring Mozambique.         Her 1946 marriage to John Rogers ended in divorce in 1961. Later that year she married H. Ernest Lafontant, and he died in 1976.         She is survived by her husband of seven years, Naguib S. Mankarious; a son, John W. Rogers Jr. of Chicago, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  June 13, 1997, Friday         The obituary of Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious on June 3 referred incorrectly to a distinction she attained when she became Deputy Solicitor General of the United States in 1973. While she was the first woman to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office, she was not the highest-ranking black staff member. That was Thurgood Marshall, who became Solicitor General in 1965.       
         Mumeo Oku, a pioneer in Japan's consumer movement and an early campaigner for women's rights, died on Monday at her Tokyo home. She was 101.         Mrs. Oku founded the Housewives' Association, one of Japan's first and best-known consumer groups, and remained its leader for decades. She also was one of the first women to serve in Parliament.         ''She opened the way for consumers' movements and consumers' rights in Japan after the war,'' said Teiko Kihara, chairwoman of the Japan League of Women Voters.         The Housewives' Association grew out of a protest over the shoddy quality of matches being rationed by the government in the impoverished days just after World War II. Only one match in 10 would light.         The association went on to protest other poor-quality goods such as clothing that shrank too much and cans labeled beef that were really filled with horse meat or whale. In protest marches, members wore aprons over their kimonos and carried large rice ladles as placards.         Consumer groups, however, never became very powerful in Japan, a nation that sacrificed its consumers' life style to build its industry. The Housewives' Association, which now has 391 local chapters, has sometimes taken positions that seem anti-consumer, such as opposing the import of inexpensive rice in order to protect Japan's farmers.         Mrs. Oku was born in Fukui Prefecture in western Japan in 1895, the eldest daughter of a blacksmith.         She graduated from Japan Women's University and became active in 1920 in the women's suffrage movement. She also worked at a spinning company to become involved in the labor movement and was appalled by the working conditions. And she ran a home to help poor women and children from 1923 until it was destroyed in an American air raid in 1944.         Japanese women gained the right to vote and hold office in 1946, when the country was under United States occupation in the years after World War II. Mrs. Oku won a seat the next year in the upper house of Parliament and served for three six-year terms.         Mrs. Oku always wore a traditional Japanese kimono, joking that she could not afford Western clothes.         ''She always wore a kimono beautifully but her mind was tougher than men's,'' said Ms. Kihara. ''She was very clear in expressing her opinion even in front of men of high status. Very few women could do that in Japan at that time.''         Mrs. Oku is survived by a daughter, Kii Nakamura, who also served as a chairman of the Housewives' Association, and a son, Kyoichi Oku, both of Tokyo.         A funeral is to be held Thursday in Tokyo.       
         Harriett R. Taylor, a senior judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court whose actions helped to ease conditions for Washington's poor and homeless, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 65.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Judge Taylor, in a special weekend session in 1989, mandated thorough changes for Washington's homeless shelters, including the addition of 50 beds and an overhaul of safety and sanitation.         In 1982, she instructed Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and housing officials to provide heat and hot water for the tenants of four battered public housing projects.         In a child custody case in 1994 involving a couple who were both lawyers, she ruled for the father.  Judge Taylor found that while both parents ''clearly love their children very much'' the father was doing the better job of balancing career and family obligations. Her ruling, which was upheld on appeal, also provided for the payment of child support by the mother.         The decision was criticized by women's organizations and praised by fathers' rights groups.         Harriett Rosen Taylor was born in the Bronx, was reared in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College and Columbia University Law School. She practiced family and labor law in New York and Washington before becoming the District's first administrative law judge in 1976, working in the newly formed Office of Consumer Protection.         President Jimmy Carter named her to a 15-year term on the Superior Court bench in 1979. She began a second 15-year term in 1994. She assumed senior status last year to teach a course, ''Effective Lawyering: The View from the Bench,'' at Stanford University, and resumed her judicial role in Washington last month.         With a strong interest in legal education, she took part in the Trial Advocacy Workshop at Harvard University and played the judge in many high school and college moot court competitions.         Judge Taylor is survived by her husband, William L., a civil rights lawyer; two daughters, Lauren Taylor of Silver Spring, Md., and Debbie Taylor of San Francisco; a son, David Van Taylor of Brooklyn; her mother, Alice Rosen, also of Brooklyn; a sister, Carole Lachman of Staten Island, and a granddaughter.       
         Mary Louise Smith, a representative of the Republican Party's moderate wing and the only woman ever to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee, died on Friday at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. She was 82 and a longtime resident of Des Moines.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son James E. Smith.         Mrs. Smith was chosen to be chairman of the Republican National Committee by Gerald Ford when he succeeded Richard M. Nixon as President in 1974.         She headed the party during the difficult period after Watergate and announced in November 1976 -- three weeks after President Ford was defeated for re-election by Jimmy Carter -- that she would step down in January 1977, instead of serving two more years.         When she made her decision known, she urged Republicans to avoid ''destructive division'' and ''a fatal lurch to either extreme of the political spectrum.''         Mrs. Smith evidently decided to step down when she did because she thought that the question of whether a moderate or a conservative was to succeed her should be resolved as soon as possible so that the party could begin getting ready for the 1978 Congressional and 1980 Presidential elections.         At the time, her party's conservative faction, associated with Ronald Reagan held the moderates responsible for President Ford's defeat. In January 1977, the Republican National Committee elected Bill Brock, a conservative former Senator from Tennessee, to succeed Mrs. Smith. After Mr. Reagan was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Smith to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. But in his second term, after she had been critical of Administration policies on civil rights, he refused to reappoint her.         Mrs. Smith, whose maiden name was Epperson, was born in the small Iowa town of Eddyville and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa. She became active and prominent in Republican politics and served on the Republican National Committee from 1964 to 1984. She also became a feminist and became known for supporting civil rights and abortion rights.         Her husband, Dr. Elmer Milton Smith, whom she married in 1934, died in 1980.         In addition to her son James, of Des Moines, she is survived by another son, Dr. Robert C., of East Lansing, Mich.; a daughter, Maggie of Jamestown, Calif.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.         Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996.         ''My time, obviously, is not quite here,'' she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.         And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, ''Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian.''         In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.         She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. ''I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time,'' she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.         Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.         In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.         Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.         ''The doctor called me every name in the book,'' Mrs. Good recalled later.         But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.         After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. ''I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have,'' she said.         A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.         In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.         Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.       
         Ruth Adler, who kept the staff of The New York Times informed about its own milestones and behind-the-scenes adventures and shaped the legends and lore of The Times for other journalists and students for 33 years as editor of the newspaper's in-house journal Times Talk, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Adler, who underwent open heart surgery in March, died of heart failure, her nephew, Peter Lewis, said.         Behind every news story there is an untold -- or rarely told -- tale of the reporter's personal experience: the hazards of covering a war or a riot, the grind of the campaign trail, a correspondent's travails with foul weather, bad food, crazy hours, unworkable communications and implausible expense accounts.         From 1947, when she became the first editor of Times Talk, to 1980, when she retired after 46 years with The Times, Ms. Adler chronicled these tales, and countless more routine doings, for the newspaper's 5,000 employees in a house organ that was one of the best and most widely read periodicals on the practice of journalism.         More than a compendium of staff marriages, births, deaths and achievements, it captured the life of the newspaper from the inside, with sometimes dramatic, often hilarious accounts from reporters around the world, from editors in a raucous city room, from printers riding Linotype machines, and hard men in square paper hats down in a thundering pressroom on 43d Street in Manhattan.         Reflecting its editor's fascination with the news and with the newspaper's daily production, her journal offered Tom Wicker's account of covering the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas; A. M. Rosenthal on his expulsion from Poland for reports that won a Pulitzer Prize; Claude Sitton on civil rights clashes in the South, and Robert Lipsyte on how to report a boxing match with a screaming fan standing on your typewriter. Such accounts were all the more intriguing in an era when most reporters were anonymous figures behind their news articles.         In 1966, Ms. Adler compiled 53 Times Talk articles in ''The Working Press: Special to The New York Times,'' published by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Eliot Fremont-Smith, in a review for The Times, said the book conveyed ''a remarkably clear picture of how The Times, as an entity, works -- how the news comes in and what happens to it, in both routine and crisis situations.''         Ms. Adler also wrote ''A Day in the Life of The New York Times'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1971), a 242-page account, hour by hour, of what the newspaper's staff did to put out the issue of Feb. 28, 1969, a date chosen arbitrarily, on which there was no earth-shaking news.         Based on memos from hundreds of Times employees, her account detailed the activities of reporters around the world and across the nation, looked over the shoulders of rewritemen pounding out inserts and of editors writing headlines and laying out pages, eavesdropped on advertising salesmen and then watched the presses roll and the delivery trucks roar away.         Ruth Adler was born in Rochester  on July 10, 1910, the daughter of Ida Lichtenstein and Mortimer Adler. She attended public schools in Rochester, graduated from Smith College and attended the Sorbonne in Paris for a year before joining The Times in 1934 as a secretary to Ivan Veit, then the promotion manager. She was not a member of the Adler family that is related to the Sulzbergers who own The Times.         Ms. Adler, who never married, played golf and tennis and was an extensive traveler.         She occasionally wrote articles for The Times's Sunday magazine or travel section. In 1947, she was asked to establish an internal news publication for the staff. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, was one of her principal fans and consultants; he gave her a small staff and complete autonomy to design, edit and produce Times Talk.         During her early tenure, Times Talk was 12 pages and appeared monthly. Later, the number of pages varied in a larger format, and it appeared 10 times a year. Its circulation went beyond The Times staff, to other journalists and to journalism schools, where many regarded it as a valuable teaching aid. Today, Times Talk has 28 pages, appears seven times a year and has a circulation of more than 8,500 current and retired employees of the newspaper.         When Ms. Adler retired in 1980, a full issue of Times Talk was devoted to her. The art critic John Canaday called her ''a living encyclopedia'' of the newspaper's recent history, and Russell Baker, the columnist, offered a tongue-in-cheek tribute to one of his favorite editors.         ''Some of the best people had worked for The Times for years before Times Talk revealed that they were actually first-rate reporters,'' he wrote. ''At a time when your material was usually reduced to chopped liver by The Times's famous editing process, the opportunity to tell the story right in Times Talk compensated for many a night when you stalked out of the office in a rage to tell it to the gin bottle.''       
         Lucy Somerville Howorth, a lawyer who said her advocacy of women's rights was inspired by the campaign that won women the vote under the 19th Amendment, died on Aug. 23 at her home in Cleveland, Miss. She was 102.         Mrs. Howorth watched from a crowded Statehouse gallery in Nashville on Aug. 18, 1920, when Tennessee ratified nationwide women's suffrage, and as the 36th state to do so put the 19th Amendment into the Constitution.         A native Mississippian, Mrs. Howorth spent much of her life in the political arena, including a turn as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1932. She was known as Judge Lucy, a sobriquet that stuck after she was appointed a United States Commissioner -- or magistrate -- for the Southern Judicial District of Mississippi in 1927.         A few years later, she moved to Washington and held legal positions in Federal agencies where few women had gone before. She retired in 1954 as general counsel of the War Claims Commission and returned home to the practice of law.         She was a national officer in the American Association of University Women, played a pivotal role in ending the organization's practice of racial segregation in the 1940's and headed a task force on the status of women and their employment opportunities after World War II. As an association vice president in the 1950's, she traveled widely and gave speeches around the country.         Born in Greenville, Miss., she came from a long line of lawyers rooted in colonial America. As a child, she said, her mother took her to suffragist meetings and nurtured her daughter's independent spirit and her wish to become a lawyer, an aspiration hardly befitting a fine Southern lady then.         Her mother, Nellie Nugent Somerville, was the first woman to be elected to the Mississippi Legislature, and Lucy also served there for four years in the 1930's.         Lucy Somerville graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1916 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and went on to study at Columbia University, where she attended political rallies and meetings and regularly visited settlement houses.         ''It was in New York City at that time,'' she recalled when Radcliffe College honored her in 1983 for a lifetime of achievements, ''that I learned to be a whole human being.''         Back home, she earned her law degree with highest honors at the University of Mississippi in 1922 and practiced law until her appointment as Judge Lucy five years later. She held positions on the legal staff in the Veterans Administration and was a director of the V.A. Employees Credit Union from 1937 to 1949, when she joined the War Claims Commission as associate general counsel.         After leaving the Government, she joined her husband, Joseph Marion Howorth, in practicing law again in Cleveland, Miss., until about 1980. Mr. Howorth died in 1982 after 54 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Howorth was president of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Washington and often served as a mentor to women in government. President John F. Kennedy named Mrs. Howorth to a task force on Federal employment for his Commission on the Status of Women.       
         Mary Weinberger, a lifelong advocate for the rights of people with muscular dystrophy, died on Sept. 8 at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 89 and had lived in Long Beach, N.Y.         Mrs. Weinberger had been hospitalized since June, when a coronary infection was diagnosed, a niece, Susan Dick of West Long Branch, N.J., said. Mrs. Weinberger died of bone marrow failure, Ms. Dick said.         Mrs. Weinberger became involved in the rights of the disabled after doctors told her that her adopted son, Richard, 2, had muscular dystrophy.         Richard had to use a wheelchair by the age of 5 and died, at 17, in 1959.         She rallied for the rights of people with physical and mental disabilities to live in their own homes instead of  institutions.         Along with her husband, Arnold, she was a founding member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the national organization best known for fund-raising telethons with its chairman, Jerry Lewis, as host.         She set up a foundation named after her son and was among the founders of Independent Living for the Handicapped, a Brooklyn-based advocacy group that helps the severely disabled to live in their own homes.         Mrs. Weinberger, a native of Manhattan, lived in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, for most of her life until 1975, when she moved to Long Beach.         Her husband died in 1983. She is survived by her sister, Frances Fenig of Miami Beach, Fla.       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Merian Lovelace Kirchner, the little girl whose pleadings for just one more bedtime story gave birth to a beloved series of children's books, died on Sept. 25 at a hospital on Staten Island. She was 66 and the daughter of Maud Hart Lovelace, the creator of the Betsy-Tacy books.         Friends said the cause was emphysema.         It was her mother who lived and wrote the Betsy-Tacy life, not so much creating as copying her characters whole from her own turn-of-the-century childhood in Mankato, Minn., or Deep Valley, as it is known in the 10 main Betsy-Tacy books and three satellite volumes.         But it was little Merian Lovelace, growing up in the 1930's in Garden City, Long Island, who first demonstrated that her mother's girlhood had more than passing appeal. She pestered her mother so often for a new story about Betsy Ray and her friend Tacy Kelly that Mrs. Lovelace, who had concentrated on short stories and historical novels, decided to put Betsy and Tacy on paper.         The result has been something of a literary cult.         For although Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly have never quite achieved the stature of, say, Nancy Drew, they have spawned a 1,000-member Betsy-Tacy society and a Betsy-Tacy home page (http://virtuflex.com/ Betsy-Tacy/), and they have turned Mankato into a tourist attraction.         Aside from the fact that Betsy was an uncommonly independent young heroine, a bustle-era girl who took her own ambitious career plans for granted, the books have exerted a special appeal because unlike Nancy Drew, who was blond, perfect and 18 forever, Betsy and her friends grew older in each successive book.         When the first book, ''Betsy-Tacy,'' covering Betsy's meeting with Tacy at age 5, was published in 1940, Mrs. Kirchner was 9. By the time she got to Smith College, she was something of a minor celebrity, letting her classmates read the proofs of the latest installment.         The last book, ''Betsy's Wedding,'' was published in 1955, a year after her marriage to Englebert Kirchner, a German-born writer.         As the daughter of a woman who turned her own childhood into literary fodder, Mrs. Kirchner might have been expected to continue the tradition.         But except for a column she wrote for the Betsy-Tacy Society newsletter, she showed little interest in her childhood and none in fiction.         Not that Mrs. Kirchner was especially rebellious. It was just that she decided to follow in the footsteps of her father, Delos Lovelace, a Minnesota-born journalist who was once city editor of the old New York Sun. (He was also the author of the novelization of the movie ''King Kong,'' which helps explain why he named his daughter after the movie's director, Merian C. Cooper.)         Settling in Greenwich Village as her parents had done a generation earlier, Mrs. Kirchner held a series of jobs in journalism, contributing to a book on civil rights for Newsfront Publishers, working as a freelance book editor, and ending her career as a senior writer for the magazine Medical Economics.         After her mother's death in 1980, Mrs. Kirchner helped keep the Betsy-Tacy flame alive, working closely with the Betsy-Tacy Society and campaigning for reissues of the books. Her husband died in 1992.         For all her role in the creation of the Betsy-Tacy series, Mrs. Kirchner never appeared as a character, except by implication.         At the end of ''Betsy's Wedding,'' as her husband, Joe, is about to go off to World War I, Betsy speaks of their plans to have a little girl named Bettina, not realizing, perhaps, that in time the little girl would make her mother write it all down.       
         Rosemary R. Gunning, who led fights against school busing in New York City in the 1960's and went on to become one of the first female Assembly members, died on Saturday night at the home of a niece in Roslyn, N.Y. She was 92.         The cause was liver cancer, said a grandniece, Patricia Gunning.         Ms. Gunning was known for her strong speaking style, clear arguments and intense community involvement as she became a founder of the state Conservative Party and the first woman to run for citywide office, in 1965, for City Council President on a ticket headed by William F. Buckley Jr. in the mayoral slot.         Beginning in 1968, she served four terms in the Assembly, becoming the first Conservative to win state office.         She was a leader in organizing Housing Court in New York and was an outspoken proponent of landlords' rights.         But she often took unexpected positions, favoring the proposed equal rights amendment as she opposed abortion. But Ms. Gunning became known as a leader of the fight against forced busing, a battle that she never defined in terms of race, but always as an issue of neighborhood control.         The effort thrust her to the forefront of one of the most tumultuous bitter battles in the city's history, with frequent picketing and racial epithets. Almost one-quarter of the students in the city stayed out of school one day in a protest that Ms. Gunning helped organize.         ''Integration is a fine thing,'' she said at the time. ''From the beginning, one of the things we wanted was to have no racial disputes, no lining of whites up against Negroes.''         However, she was not a parent. ''If I had children, I wouldn't have time for all this,'' she said.         In those battles, Ms. Gunning, who was shorter than 5 feet and often needed platforms to reach the microphones in front of her, became known as Grandma Gunning, for her middle-class appearance and sometimes stern demeanor.         It was her clarity of mind that most impressed Mr. Buckley, he said, adding, ''What was special about her was her facility in taking complicated matters and putting them in very clear negotiable form.''         But others described her as a dangerous force in 1964, particularly her urgings to keep children out of school as a protest. The president of the Board of Education, James Donovan, called that reprehensible, saying the move was a ''conspiracy to destroy'' public education.         Ms. Gunning's allies strenuously argue that time has vindicated her position. ''History has proven her right,'' Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, said. ''Forced school busing ultimately ended up being a total failure in New York, ripping up neighborhood after neighborhood.''         Indeed, school busing was replaced by neighborhood control of schools and local school boards, a change that recently gave way to greater central control by the Board of Education.         Ms. Gunning was born in Brooklyn and moved to Queens at an early age. She entered the Brooklyn Law School directly from high school, one of the last students to do so. She was one of 10 women in a class of 600 and was admitted to the bar in 1930. After entering private practice, she later  worked 11 years as a private lawyer with the Army.         From her early youth until she died, she lived in the house in which her grandparents had lived, a white clapboard at 1867 Grove Street in Ridgewood, Queens. Her husband, Lester Moffett, had various jobs, including working as a guard at the 1964-65 World's Fair.         For all her accomplishments, people seem to remember her as the woman next door. Assemblyman Robert Werts, a Republican with whom she served, remembered an event at Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's estate to entertain legislators, recalling, ''I looked over, and she was hitting her husband over the head with a pocketbook to straighten him out.''         She worked as a private lawyer until she was 90, her grandniece said. She also continued to lobby on behalf of property owners, though she sometimes forgot to collect the $200-a-month rent that she charged a tenant for a room in her house. She also volunteered to help immigrants with  legal problems.         Surviving are a nephew, John, of Islip, N.Y.; 2 nieces, Marie and Ann, of Roslyn; 13 grandnieces and nephews, and a cousin, Sylvia Boyland of Fresh Meadows, Queens.       
         Helen Stevenson Meyner, a liberal Democrat who was elected to two terms in Congress by a heavily Republican district in New Jersey, died yesterday after a long illness at the Heartland Health Care Center, a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 69.         Mrs. Meyner was born into a prominent Democratic family in New York City in 1928. Her parents, William E. and Eleanor B. Stevenson, set up American Red Cross units in England and North Africa during World War II. Her father, who founded the law firm that became Debevoise & Plimpton, was president of Oberlin College in Ohio after the war and Ambassador to the Philippines from 1961 to 1964.         A graduate of Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Mrs. Meyner was a field worker for the Red Cross in Korea from 1950 to 1952, then a tour guide at the United Nations. There, she met an executive of Trans World Airlines, who hired her to travel the world promoting T.W.A. under the name Mary Gordon.         In 1956, she volunteered for the Presidential campaign of Adlai E. Stevenson, a distant cousin of her mother's, and met Gov. Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey, who was visiting Oberlin College. They were married the following year.         At Morven, the governor's mansion in Princeton, Mrs. Meyner welcomed visitors like Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. She also served on the boards of the Newark Museum, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and Rider College. As a member of a panel of the Kennedy Administration, Mrs. Meyner studied the problems of the United States Foreign Service corps in Eastern Europe.         Because of a two-term limit, the Meyners left Morven in 1962 and bought a home in Princeton. Mr. Meyner began a law practice, and Mrs. Meyner continued her community service.         After four years of fertility treatment in the late 1960's, Mrs. Meyner became pregnant for the first time and gave an interview to The Ladies' Home Journal for an article titled ''My Miracle Baby.'' But in February 1970, the month the article was published, her baby, a full-term boy, was born dead. Mrs. Meyner is survived by a sister, Priscilla Hunt, of Cambridge, Mass.         In 1972, Democratic Party leaders asked her to run for Congress from the Meyner family home in Phillipsburg, in the heavily Republican 13th Congressional District in Sussex and Morris Counties. She lost that election to Joseph J. Maraziti, a Republican, but defeated him in 1974, the same year that Representative Millicent Fenwick, a Republican, was elected. Only two other women had represented New Jersey on Capitol Hill before.         Overshadowed somewhat by Representative Fenwick, Mrs. Meyner, who established a solidly liberal voting record, was sometimes referred to as New Jersey's ''other Congresswoman.''         During her two terms in office, Mrs. Meyner served on the Committee on International Relations, but turned down an invitation to join the powerful Ways and Means Committee, saying she feared stretching herself too thin. As a member of International Relations, she fought to stop the nuclear arms race, but she  helped prevent the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County from closing in 1976 by having the Armament Research and Development Command transferred there.         Mrs. Meyner also pressed for women's rights while in Congress. In 1978, she was defeated by the Republican candidate, Jim Courter.         After leaving Washington, Mrs. Meyner served on the boards of directors of Allied Chemical, Girard Trust and Prudential Insurance, and through her work in these companies, she continued to advocate for women. In 1990, Governor Meyner died and Mrs. Meyner retired to Captiva Island, Fla. She and her family established the Robert B. Meyner and Helen S. Meyner Center for the Study of State and Local Government at her husband's alma mater, Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.       
         Toni Carabillo, a leader and historian of the modern feminist movement, died on Oct. 28 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said Susie Gilligan of Feminist Majority, a national group that Ms. Carabillo helped found 10 years ago.         Ms. Carabillo, who was co-author of ''Feminist Chronicles, 1953-1993,'' rallied to the feminist cause more than 30 years ago when she joined the National Organization for Women. Under her guidance, NOW branches took root throughout California, and she served over the years as president of the Los Angeles chapter, national vice president, a board member and co-editor of the organization's national newsletter.         She founded Feminist Majority in 1987 together with Eleanor Smeal, Peg Yorkin, Katherine Spillar and Judith Meuli, her companion and partner in a Los Angeles graphic arts business since 1970. The group seeks to encourage women to attain positions of leadership in all walks of life.         The group promotes women who are on their way up as professionals in the private and public sectors. It conducts campus campaigns, makes available internships, compiles statistics and maintains a speakers' bureau.         At her death, Ms. Carabillo was national vice president. Ms. Smeal is president.         ''Feminist Chronicles,'' written with Ms. Meuli and June Csida and published in 1993 by Graphics Press, became a textbook for women's studies in colleges and universities. With Ms. Meuli, Ms. Carabello also wrote ''The Feminization of Power'' (Fund for the Feminist Majority, 1988). Ms. Carabillo had recently been working on ''The Feminist Chronicles of the 20th Century,'' a volume that Ms. Smeal and Ms. Meuli plan to complete.         Ms. Carabillo was born in Jackson Heights, Queens. Majoring in American literature, she graduated from Middlebury College in 1948 and earned a master's degree the next year at Columbia University. She went on to work as a writer and graphic designer.         In 1969, she co-founded the Women's Heritage Corporation, a publishing company. It produced ''Women's Heritage Calendar and Almanac'' and paperbacks about women's rights advocates like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucy Stone.         Ms. Carabillo leaves no immediate family.       
         Esther Peterson, a dogged consumer advocate whose work has an impact on Americans every time they buy a can of soup or a box of laundry detergent, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Peterson served in the Administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and worked for businesses as well. Among her accomplishments was the labeling of foods with their nutritional value, so that shoppers can determine whether so many vitamins and proteins are worth their price in calories.         Similarly, she successfully advocated that products be priced per unit, so that a calculator was not needed to figure out whether 14.5 ounces of breakfast cereal at $4.29 or 15.75 ounces at $4.59 is the better buy.         And she accomplished those things with a gentle cajoling that masked an iron determination. At a party marking Mrs. Peterson's 90th birthday last year, Lynda Johnson Robb recalled the help that her father, President Johnson, got from Mrs. Peterson, and said, ''She had a velvet hammer and talked people into doing what was right, even if we didn't know it at the time.''         In her long career, in which she was active until just recently, Mrs. Peterson was an educator, a labor organizer, a public official and an advocate of women's rights.         She organized a strike in Boston in the 1930's among women who sewed aprons at home and were forced by their employer to switch from square pockets to heart-shaped ones, which were more difficult to cut and sew, without any increase in wages.         ''She won the strike,'' her son Iver said over the weekend, ''after she told the women to picket the boss but to dress nicely, because the police in Boston used to back their horses into pickets, 'but if you are properly dressed, the police won't do it.' ''         Mrs. Peterson was born in 1906 in Provo, Utah, to two immigrants from Denmark, Lars Eggertsen, the local superintendent of schools, and his wife, Annie, who, according to her son, ''kept boarders because they didn't pay superintendents much in those days.''         She received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in 1927 and a master's from Teachers' College, Columbia University, in 1930. She held several teaching positions in the 1930's, including one at the innovative Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which brought milliners, telephone operators and garment workers onto the campus.         A Bryn Mawr College official described the school as a place ''not only to teach but to learn from the women workers the problems that together they and we must solve,'' but her son said that Mrs. Peterson's description was more succinct: a place that combined Shakespeare, drama and socialism.         She worked for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the American Federation of Teachers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. In 1961, President Kennedy named her an Assistant Secretary of Labor and Director of the Women's Bureau, an agency that administered the labor laws concerning women.         When Mr. Johnson became President, he brought Mrs. Peterson into the White House as his special adviser for consumer affairs, and she served in a similar capacity for President Carter.         In 1971, at the age of 65, Mrs. Peterson started another career, this time in business as vice president for consumer affairs at Giant Food Inc., the largest supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area.         Odonna Mathews, who worked with Mrs. Peterson as a University of Maryland undergraduate intern and now holds Mrs. Peterson's old position at Giant, said: ''Her friends in consumer activism asked, 'How can you work for a business and represent the consumer?' She showed it could be done.''         At Giant, Ms. Mathews said, she worked with Mrs. Peterson on the grade labeling of food. ''She found it confusing,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She asked, 'What's the difference between U.S. Fancy No. 1 and Extra Fancy?' ''         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson persuaded the supermarket to disclose what seafood had been previously frozen, a widespread practice now but one not in use before then.         ''She got Giant to try nutritional labeling on its private products before it was required by Federal law, comparing calories and proteins,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She got Giant to use open dating -- putting a date by which products like yogurt or milk must be sold.''         Before then, the stores used letter and number combinations to express the dates, a code that was not clear to buyers.         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson visited Giant stores often and was easily recognized by shoppers. She was tall, about 5 feet 10 inches, and she wore her long braided gray hair in a distinctive upsweep on the top of her head, a style described by her children as a ''Gretchen braid.''         Her photograph appeared in many of Giant's advertisements, including one in April 1972 when a shortage of beef caused its price to rocket and Mrs. Peterson urged the supermarket chain's customers to avoid beef purchases until the price came down.         ''You have a right to be informed about meat prices,'' a Giant advertisement said. ''We consumers can help bring prices down. Buy less meat. Use other forms of protein.''         The advertisement listed alternatives to meat like beans and lentils and was signed by Mrs. Peterson.         Mrs. Peterson later was hired by the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents as its consumer adviser, concerning herself particularly with the problems of older people, and she continued to keep a foot in both camps, serving on the board of Consumers Union.         She ended her public service career under yet another Democratic President, serving in a largely honorary role for the Clinton Administration with the United States Delegation to the United Nations.         Besides her son Iver, of Lawrenceville, N.J., who is a reporter for The New York Times, Mrs. Peterson is survived by two other sons, Eric N.,  of Alexandria, Va., and Lars E., of Washington; a daughter, Karen K. Wilken of Fort Collins, Colo., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Margaret Storrs Grierson, the former archivist of Smith College who built its Sophia Smith Collection into an international research center, died on Dec. 12 at the Linda Manor Extended Care Facility in Leeds, Mass. She was 97.         Born in Denver, she graduated from Smith in 1922 and earned a doctorate seven years later at Bryn Mawr College, where she taught for several years. Returning to Smith, she taught philosophy until she was named archivist in 1940.         In 1942 she took on the additional tasks of executive secretary of Friends of the Library and director of its fledgling Sophia Smith Collection. Named after the college's patron, the collection initially served as a repository of works by female writers but grew over the years into a women's history archive.         From the modest beginning of the collection and until she retired in 1965, Dr. Grierson traveled the world to document the experience of women from the colonial era to the present. The collection now stretches over some 5,500 feet of shelves and includes materials about women's rights, suffrage, birth control, the women's movement of recent years  and women in the arts.         Traditional historiography had often overlooked women's roles, and the Smith collection helped supply the records once researchers began their studies of women. Sherrill Redmon, director of the collection, called Dr. Grierson ''one of the unsung heroes who made the field of women's history possible.''         Dr. Grierson is survived by a brother, Lucius S. Storrs Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.       
         After Shira A. Scheindlin was appointed to the Federal District Court in Manhattan a few years ago, she told an interviewer for a legal newspaper that she expected to be more of a ''settling judge than a brilliant opinion writer.''         But in case after case these days, Judge Scheindlin seems to be making a name for herself through the incisive, often witty opinions she writes as well as the striking decisions they contain.         On Monday, in a major ruling against the Giuliani administration, she found that city officials had violated New York magazine's free speech rights when they pulled satirical advertisements from buses. The ads tweaked the Mayor for taking credit for most of the city's virtues.         Her 30-page decision was full of meticulous constitutional analysis, but it was also tinged with sarcasm and humor. ''Who would have dreamed that the Mayor would object to more publicity?'' Judge Scheindlin wrote, going out of her way to cite Mr. Giuliani's daily presence in the local newspapers and his appearance in drag last month on ''Saturday Night Live.''         Then, on Thursday, she found herself in the middle of another contentious dispute, between the two most powerful prosecutors in New York City: Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and United States Attorney Mary Jo White.         Mr. Morgenthau's senior aides had asked Judge Scheindlin to block Ms. White's prosecutors from completing a plea agreement in a stock trading case that Mr. Morgenthau had initiated. ''This is a dispute between your bosses,'' the judge said, ruling against Mr. Morgenthau's prosecutors. ''They should sit down for coffee some day and talk about it.''         The judge behind these rulings is a 51-year-old with a master's degree in Chinese history from Columbia University and a law degree from Cornell. She acknowledged that she has ''been doing more on the opinion side'' than she thought she would when President Clinton named her to the Federal bench in 1994.         ''The only answer I can say is that there have been wonderful issues that just begged to be addressed,'' said Judge Scheindlin (pronounced SHEND-lin) during an interview in her 10th-floor chambers in the Federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. ''And I like to write. It's fun.''         But her rulings have drawn the ire of the Mayor and others. For two straight days this week, Mr. Giuliani attacked her decision in the New York magazine case, saying she had ''tortured her interpretation to get where she is.''         Last January, after she suppressed evidence in a case and questioned a program in which the police stopped and searched taxicabs, Mr. Giuliani declared that Judge Scheindlin did not care as much for ''the rights of victims and potential victims as accused criminals.''         And recently, the Federal Court of Appeals overturned another decision, in which she found unconstitutional a law allowing the Government to ban the sale of sexually explicit magazines on military bases.         Nonetheless, other legal experts defend her work. Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said of her New York magazine opinion: ''The idea that this is some sort of torturous reach by her is simply inaccurate. What is unusual here is not the judicial ruling that the First Amendment has been violated, but the Mayor's conduct, which led to the violation.''         As for the taxicab search ruling, Matthew E. Fishbein, a senior Federal prosecutor at the time, said that although Judge Scheindlin rejected the Government's position in the case, ''the degree of criticism directed at her was in my view excessive and unfair.''         In the opinion, he said, ''she went out of her way to suggest ways for the department to conform its policy so that it would pass constitutional muster, something that the department ultimately did.''         Judge Scheindlin will not discuss individual cases, but says she can live with the criticism. ''I realize that some of the decisions are not immediately popular,'' she said. But she believes there is a balance. The long-term benefit, she says, ''is that we keep our constitutional rights.''         Judge Scheindlin, the daughter of a Russian immigrant and his American wife, was born in Washington.  She grew up in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan.         She had never even met a ''real live lawyer,'' she said, until she entered law school in 1972. After graduating, she was a clerk for Judge Charles L. Brieant in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who remembers her as someone who ''got to the point.''         ''Her logic and her thinking are just without parallel,'' Judge Brieant said.         She was in private practice, and served as a United States magistrate and a Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, before being named to the Federal bench. Now, as then, she says she believes that lawyers and judges can make a difference in society.         In personal conversations, the judge laces her comments with a puckish humor and a bright laugh. From the bench, though, she does not waste words. She can seem brusque, and will cut off a lawyer who is rambling. Several lawyers say they have been the target of her withering glance and her admonition that they make their case more clearly.         A week ago, as the oral arguments in the New York magazine case came to a close, one of the city's lawyers rose. ''May I just have half a minute?'' he asked, with apparent trepidation in his voice.         ''I doubt that it is really going to take half a minute,'' Judge Scheindlin said. ''If you let me cut you off in 30 seconds, go ahead.''         One half-minute later, she interrupted him: ''That was 30 seconds. Is that the point?'' In six words, she then summarized it, asking, ''Was that the point?''         ''Yes, Your Honor,'' the lawyer replied.         Ronald L. Kuby, the criminal defense lawyer known for his passionate advocacy and, at times, his loquaciousness in the courtroom, said he had been chastised by Judge Scheindlin, but rightly so.         ''In court, she's brilliant,'' he said. ''Incisive. Suffers fools not at all.'' He said she pays attention to what a lawyer says and ''she gets very upset when you repeat it. Because she actually heard it the first time.''         The judge, in an interview, acknowledged that her style can be quite direct.         You like to get to the point, she was told.         ''Yes,'' she replied.         Do you realize that about yourself?         ''Yes.''         It is part of your style?         ''Yes.''         You do it with everybody?         ''Yes.''         ''People could talk endlessly around and around an issue,'' she went on. ''Let's get to the heart of the matter. I try to be very direct.'' She added: ''I often say to lawyers, what do you want? Focus yourself. Then I get a much better answer.''         The demands she makes of lawyers, she imposes on herself. As arguments ended in the New York magazine case, on a Friday afternoon, she said she would rule ''as soon as humanly possible.''         She worked through the weekend in her chambers, a court staff member said, and when she had not finished by Sunday evening, worked throughout the night. The opinion was ready for release on Monday morning.         ''I felt the urgency of the parties' needs -- both sides,'' she said.
