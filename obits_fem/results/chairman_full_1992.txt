         Dora R. Inselbuch, a longtime national board member of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization, died on Thursday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale. She was 93 years old and had lived in Manhattan until eight years ago.         Her family said she died of natural causes in her sleep.         During her 16 years on the national board, Mrs. Inselbuch served in several capacities. In the 1940's, she was chairman of the Jewish National Fund department, Hadassah's official Zionist land-buying agency in what was then Palestine. The fund raised money for colonization and land-reclamation work, including reforestation.         She also was a past national Hadassah chairman for young people pioneering in Palestine and helped found Kibbutz Hasollelim to train young Zionists. It remains an operating kibbutz today in Israel. Daughter of a Rabbi         Mrs. Inselbuch, the daughter of a rabbi, was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, then part of czarist Russia. She came to the United States as a 5-year-old and grew up in Denver.         While attending Hunter College, she became one of the first recipients of a Hebrew teacher's certificate from the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary. As Jewish education chairman for Hadassah, she later was an organizer of the seminary's School for Jewish Women.         Mrs. Inselbuch began her community work as a leader in Young Judaea, the national Zionist youth movement supported by Hadassah. She was a past vice president of the Brooklyn and New York chapters of Hadassah and founder of its Jersey City chapter. She also was a founding member of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism in New York.

         Marion Margery Scranton Isaacs, who was long active in Pennsylvania civic affairs and Republican politics, died on Thursday at the Scranton family home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Dalton, Pa.         Her family said she had a stroke on Dec. 25 and never recovered.         Mrs. Isaacs, a member of the family that gave the city of Scranton its name, supported community improvement projects through the Scranton Area Foundation. Formerly a family charity, it became a public community foundation in 1989, and Mrs. Isaacs served as its chairman from 1954 until her death.         She was the sister of former Gov. William W. Scranton and took part in his Congressional, gubernatorial and Presidential campaigns. She was also a former member of the Pennsylvania Republican State Committee.

         Gertrude Shurr, who performed in the 1920's and 30's with such pioneering American modern dance companies as Denishawn, the Humphrey-Weidman Concert Company and the early Martha Graham company, died on Thursday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 88 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Dr. Rachael Yocom, a friend.         Born in Riga, Latvia, Miss Shurr came to the United States as a child. Her first professional fee, as she later described it, was a penny she earned dancing in the streets with an organ grinder whose music she liked. She began her formal dance training at the Denishawn school of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn and also studied with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Martha Graham. Taught Notable Figures         She danced with the Denishawn company from 1925 to 1927, leaving to join the earliest Humphrey-Weidman company, with which she danced from 1927 to 1929. She left to teach at the Graham school, corralling students at other studios for Miss Graham's first classes for adults. Miss Shurr joined the Graham company in 1930, dancing in many Graham classics in her eight years there. Among them was "Primitive Mysteries," which she helped Miss Graham revive in 1982.         Miss Shurr left the Graham troupe to perform with May O'Donnell, another company member, with whom she opened a dance studio in New York City; students there included Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, who later founded the Joffrey Ballet. In the early 1940's she received bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education, specializing in dance, from San Francisco State College and the University of Oregon, respectively.         Miss Shurr taught at the High School of Performing Arts in New York for more than two decades, serving as chairman of the dance department for three years. A tiny woman with a robust sense of humor, she established a reputation as a tough but loyal and influential teacher. Her students included the entertainers Ben Vereen and Liza Minnelli. She also was assistant choreographer for the Broadway musicals "Sadie Thompson" (1944) and "Top Banana" (1951).         Miss Shurr retired in 1971 but continued to work sporadically as a rehearsal coach. She was a dance adviser for the Arizona Commission on the Arts and directed the University of Utah's Opportunity Theater and Dance Workshop, a summer program. Last year she was named an Arizona Dance Treasure by the Arizona Dance Arts Alliance.         She is survived by her brother, George, of Manhattan.       
         Roberta Bender Grossman, the president and publisher of Zebra Books, died on March 13 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Walter Zacharius, the chairman of Kensington Publishing Corporation, which owns Zebra Books.         Mrs. Grossman was born in Brooklyn and attended New York University. When she founded Zebra Books with Mr. Zacharius in 1975, she became, at the age of 29, the youngest president of a paperback house. Over the next decade, she expanded the company's range of titles from historical romances to both paperback and hard-cover novels and general nonfiction. Authors published by the company, with whom Mrs. Grossman worked closely, included Jerzy Kosinski, Isaac Asimov and Joyce Carol Oates. In 1988, Zebra acquired Pinnacle Books, and Mrs. Grossman took on its presidency as well.         She is survived by her husband, Robin, and a daughter, Shoshanna.       
         Catherine Wolkonsky, a French and Russian teacher for 50 years and founding chairman of the Slavic Department at the State University of New York at Albany, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 96 years old and lived in Spring Valley, N.Y.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Born into a landowning family in St. Petersburg, she came to the United States in 1924. She taught French in Cooperstown, N.Y., until World War II, when Cornell University started training Army officers in Russian. She became the only woman on the faculty then. She was chairman and professor of Russian at Vassar College from 1946 to 1961, after which she led the Slavic Department at SUNY, Albany, until 1972.         Mrs. Wolkonsky continued to teach at the Russian Summer School at Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., until 1985, when she was 90 years old.         She is survived by her daughter, Maria Marr, of Spring Valley, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Janet Wolf Levy, a patron of the arts, died yesterday at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan and Armonk, N.Y.         Mrs. Levy died of lung cancer, her family said.         She was named by Mayor David N. Dinkins earlier this month as one of several recipients of the annual Mayor's Very Special Arts Awards for promoting the arts for people with disabilities.         She was the chairwoman of Creative Alternatives, a drama therapy program at the Mount Sinai Medical Center.         Mrs. Levy became a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs & Company in 1976 at the death of her husband of 42 years, Gustave L. Levy. Mr. Levy was the head of Goldman, Sachs, a leading international investment banking firm, and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.         Ms. Levy, who was born in Huntington, W.Va., grew up in Baltimore. She attended college and art school.         She is survived by her son, Peter, of Manhattan; a daughter, Betty Hess, of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Minnie Mazer Nathanson, a philanthropist involved in the founding of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         She died of lymphatic cancer, said her daughter, Bobbie Abrams of Manhattan.         At the time of her death, she was a member of the boards of the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum and chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel-Jewish Association for College Youth.         She and her three brothers and a sister jointly donated the funds for the construction, in the mid-1950's, of the first dormitory at Albert Einstein College. Mrs. Nathanson and her siblings gave the Mazer Building in memory of their father, Abraham Mazer, who died in 1952. Mr. Mazer was a founder and chairman of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company, based in New York City and later sold to Georgia-Pacific.         Over the years, Mrs. Nathanson was also a vice president and trustee of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, an officer of the Council of Jewish Federations and a member of the board of the New York Association for New Americans.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College.         Her husband, Dr. Louis Nathanson, a radiologist and member of the Albert Einstein College faculty, died in 1968.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Dr. Noel Nathanson of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anna Lopin, and a brother, William Mazer, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         May Rudin, philanthropist and matriarch of one of Manhattan's real-estate dynasties, died yesterday at her East Side home. She was 95 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         A native of New York City, she was one of seven children born to immigrant parents. May Cohen dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and enrolled in a business school to study typing, stenography, bookkeeping and commercial law. She then went to work as a bookkeeper.         In 1923, she married Samuel Rudin, who four years later founded Rudin Management, realtors and builders, whose holdings now comprise dozens of tall buildings. The buildings, assembled over 60 years, were valued at $1.5 billion by analysts two years ago.         When Mr. Rudin died in 1975, his will established the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, of which Mrs. Rudin was the chairwoman at her death. Well into her 90's, she played an active part in its disbursements, which at last count, in 1990, came to 222 grants totaling $5.3 million. Sponsors of the Marathon         The foundation primarily supported education, social and religious welfare agencies, hospitals and health associations as well as museums and the performing arts. The money was spent mostly in Manhattan, where the Rudins' assets are concentrated.         The Rudins also were the first business sponsors of the New York City Marathon. From its inauguration in 1976 until 1990, May Rudin waited at the finish line each year to present the Samuel Rudin Trophy to the man and woman who broke the tape. Her husband, she noted, was keen on long-distance running well before it became fashionable.         Foundation beneficiaries included St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing, AIDS-related programs, Phoenix House and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center to public-school children, Lincoln Center and New York University, where the foundation endowed a chair in the humanities.         Mrs. Rudin is survived by her sons Jack and Lewis, respectively the chairman and the president of the family business, both residents of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Karena P. Somerville, the manager of Consolidated Edison's Customer Outreach program, died on Thursday. She was 46 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         Mrs. Somerville died in an automobile accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway near the Orchard Beach exit in the Bronx. Her car struck a tree early Thursday morning in a construction area, the police said.         Mrs. Somerville, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Syracuse University. In 1973 she joined Con Edison's public-affairs department in Westchester. In 1987 she was named director of public affairs for Con Edison's Westchester customer service unit, and in 1990 she was named assistant to the chairman of Consolidated Edison.         Mrs. Somerville is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Kelley; a son, Chad; a twin sister, Tamara Westover, all of Rye, and her father, Paul Buiar of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Dr. Evelyn B. Man, a biochemist who helped develop the first widely used test to detect low hormone levels in the thyroid gland, which enabled treatment to prevent mental retardation, died on Sept. 3 at her home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer, a funeral home spokesman said.         "She was one of the top authorities in the world on thyroid," said Dr. Philip K. Bondy, the retired chairman of the department of medicine at Yale, where she did most of her work.         Her efforts won the American Thyroid Association's Distinguished Service Award and the United Cerebral Palsy Award for Research.         Dr. Man was a full-time researcher and educator in biochemistry for more than 40 years. In the 1930's she worked with John P. Peters and Herman Yannet to develop the first practical test for thyroid levels.         The procedure, the protein bound iodine test, and a later version called the butanol extractable iodine test, enabled the identification of people with abnormal thyroid functions. High thyroid levels, if untreated, can be fatal. Low thyroid levels cause cretinism, but that is reversible with thyroid supplements.         Early surveys using the test showed that low hormone levels in the thyroid gland were the leading cause of preventable retardation. Many institutionalized patients were found to have been misdiagnosed as demented and were restored to normal functioning with thyroid medication.         Later thyroid tests, developed by other scientists, are now used to screen all newborns in developed countries.         Dr. Man also studied the effect of nuclear radiation on thyroid functioning in survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan in World War II.         Dr. Man was born in Lawrence, L.I. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1925 and earned a doctorate in physiological chemistry at Yale in 1932.         She worked variously as a technician, researcher and professor at Yale from 1928 to 1961, then worked nine years at Brown University.         Although she retired from full-time work in 1970, she continued her studies. She published 156 scientific papers over a period of about 60 years, the last in 1991.         For much of her life Dr. Man lived in North Stonington, Conn., where she was an officer in the North Stonington Historical Society. She was also active in the local hospital and library in Westerly, R.I.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, the director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, died on Sept. 3 at the institute, where she lived. She was 63 years old.         She died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes, the institute said.         Sister Scaglione had worked as an educator since joining the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order, in 1947.         The order operates Grace Institute, which was founded by William Russell Grace and is now headed by his grandson, J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company.         The institute provides free occupational training, mostly for secretarial work, and other adult education, including nutrition, cooking and clothing classes, for women. It enrolls about 1,000 students a year.         As the director, Sister Scaglione helped adapt the institute's program to the changing needs of the city's minority and immigrant women. She introduced new courses, including English as second language, and added night sessions and classes in the Bronx.         Before working at Grace, Sister Joseph taught at St. Raymond's Academy and Spellman High School in the Bronx and was the director of St. Joseph's Academy in Greenwich Village.         A native of New Jersey, she grew up in Manhattan and Queens. After graduating from the College of Mount St. Vincent, she earned a master's degree in business education from the College of St. Rose.         Surviving are a brother and sister, Jack and Rosalie Scaglione, both of Queens.         Correction:  September 26, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Sept. 12 on Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, misidentified her Roman Catholic order. The order, which runs the institute, is the Sisters of Charity, not the Sisters of Mercy.       
         Esta Brodey Huttner, a founder and longtime board member of the Karen Horney Foundation, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         Her family said she died of cardiopulmonary failure.         She underwent psychotherapy with a disciple of Karen Horney, the German-born psychoanalyst whose methods departed from Freudian orthodoxy. She then befriended Dr. Horney and was so impressed with the analyst's work that she joined a group of people who decided to carry it on.         When Dr. Horney died in 1952, the Karen Horney Foundation was formed. It raised funds to start a clinic that would offer affordable or free services and serve as a training center for psychotherapists.         The Karen Horney Clinic opened in Manhattan in 1955. Mrs. Huttner was vice chairman of the board of directors from then until 1975, and continued as a director into the 1980's.         Mrs. Huttner, who was born in Brooklyn, started a business career as a millinery buyer for a department store. From 1946 to 1960, she operated a Brooklyn glass factory, Peerless Art, creating hand-painted designs on glass.         In 1975 she became the first national administrator for the Cancer Research Institute in Manhattan, which finances immunological research looking for a cancer cure. Mrs. Huttner retired in 1983.         Mrs. Huttner is survived by a son, Dr. James F. Brodey of West Hartford, Conn.; a stepson, Richard Huttner of Middletown, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Hilary Fylstra of Lake Tahoe, Nev.; a sister, Celia Hartley of New Port Richey, Fla.; and four grandchildren.       
         Janet Viertel, an underwater photographer, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. She was 77 years old and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Newark, she attended public schools and the School of Dramatic Art, New York University. She married Joseph Viertel and lived in Stamford, Conn., where she took part in civic activities. She became water resources chairman of the Connecticut State Board of the League of Women Voters, which awakened her interest in the coastal waters and oceans.         At the age of 50, when her children had grown up, she decided to become an underwater photographer, learned to dive and moved to St. Croix with her husband. The results were three books published by Grosset & Dunlap: "Undersea Gardens of the Virgin Islands" (1969); "Blue Planet, the Ecology of the Oceans" (1973), intended for high-school students, and "Underwater Holidays" (1978), a diving-and-snorkeling guide.         Her work was exhibited in one-woman shows at the Eastman Kodak galleries and at Grand Central Terminal in New York and at colleges and galleries around the country. She showed her work on television talk shows.         She always maintained a sense of humor about her work. Asked by a television interviewer which she enjoyed more, the scuba diving or photography, she replied: "The part I like best is when I come back to the surface and have a gin and tonic."         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Viertel is survived by a daughter, Alice Krieger of Manhattan; two sons, Tom of Manhattan, and Jack of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Joy Golden of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Barbara Reach, a former mayoral assistant in New York City and a housing and city planning expert, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of kidney failure, said a friend, Eleanor Stier, who lived with her.         Ms. Reach was born in New York and attended private schools in the city and in Switzerland. A housing specialist with the Community Service Society, a civic group, she was appointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1965 as chairman of the Citizens' Advisory Committee of the Housing and Redevelopment Board. Mayor John V. Lindsay named her in 1969 to a board that oversaw the city's rent-control law.         In 1974, Mayor Abraham D. Beame named Ms. Reach one of four mayoral assistants -- believed to be the first woman to serve in that capacity -- and an adviser on housing matters. She helped to organize the city's Commission on the Status of Women and later was appointed to the staff of the City Planning Commission.         She was cited by the National Park Service for helping to preserve parkland in the New York metropolitan region and establishing the Gateway National Park recreation area.         Since 1986, she was a lay member of the state Supreme Court Appellate Division's Disciplinary Committee, the unit that reviews misconduct complaints against lawyers.         Ms. Reach was divorced in 1960 from James Reach, a playwright and author, who died in 1970.         She is survived by a sister, Mildred Bright of Northridge, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Carol Reach of Van Nuys, Calif.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents.
