         Candy Barr, an exotic dancer whose hardscrabble life became Texas legend as she befriended Jack Ruby (who killed President John F. Kennedy's assassin), dated a mobster, shot her husband went to prison for drug possession, and starred -- unwillingly, she insisted -- in a famous stag film, died on Friday in Victoria, Tex. She was 70.         The Slavik Funeral Home in Edna, Tex., confirmed the death, but provided no details. The Associated Press said she died of pneumonia.         Miss Barr said she was forced in 1951 at 16 to play the lead in a grainy black-and-white erotic movie titled ''Smart Aleck.'' The plot, such as it is, begins with a traveling salesman luring the teenager from the swimming pool into his motel room.         Al Di Lauro and Gerald Rabkin, in their 1976 book, ''Dirty Movies: An Illustrated History of the Stag Film,'' called it ''the single most popular film of the genre.'' They refer to Miss Barr as ''the first pornographic star'' and liken her to Lenny Bruce as a subverter of official morality. The film was not shown in theaters, but was a hit on the bachelor party and smoker circuit.         Many decades after the film and her subsequent fame as a striptease artist, Miss Barr was listed by Playboy magazine in 1999 as one of the 20th century's most desirable women.         For students of the Kennedy assassination, it is her friendship with Mr. Ruby, a nightclub owner, that is most provocative. They were friends over the years, and seven months before the assassination, he visited Miss Barr after her release from prison and gave her two dachshund puppies. He thought she should breed them.         Miss Barr coached Joan Collins on how to portray an exotic dancer in the 1960 film ''Seven Thieves,'' getting credit as technical adviser. Farrah Fawcett conferred with Miss Barr about playing her in a biographical film but never did.         She was born Juanita Dale Slusher on July 6, 1935, in Edna, Tex. Though she told Inside Detective magazine in 1959 that she was fed up with notoriety and hated being called Candy Barr, she went back and forth and never really relinquished the name. At her last public appearance in 1998, to open the Ruby Room at a Dallas club, she was Candy.         As a young child, she said in an interview with Oui magazine in 1976, she was molested by a male babysitter. When she was 9, her mother died. Her father remarried, and she said the harsh discipline of her stepmother impelled her to run away when she was in the ninth grade. A marriage at 14 to a safecracker ended in divorce.         She said a man she met at a club forced her to do the blue movie, sometimes saying he drugged her.         ''I was taken, done and that was it,'' she told Oui.         She dyed her hair blond and progressed from cigarette girl to an exotic dancer well known enough to require a flashy name. She loved chocolate, hence Candy Barr.         She shot her second of four husbands in the stomach in January 1956 after he came home drunk and threatened her. He said that he deserved it, and a grand jury dismissed charges. She soon got a booking to strip in Las Vegas, and, in 1957, played a comedy role in a legitimate theater in Dallas.         Later that year she was arrested for possession of marijuana in a case that drew wide attention because of Texas's tough new drug laws and questions about the legality of wiretapping by the Dallas police. During her appeal, she made $2,000 a week stripping in Las Vegas and Los Angeles to music specially composed for her. Around this time, she dated Mickey Cohen, an infamous mobster in the West.         After the Texas Supreme Court upheld her conviction, she served three years of a 15-year sentence. She wrote a poetry book in prison and emerged in a somber black outfit, quoting Bible verses. Around 1970, she largely disappeared from public view, with the notable exception of a nude pictorial feature in Oui, done when she was 41.         ''Let the world find someone else to talk about,'' she said in an interview with Texas Monthly in 2001. ''I like being left alone.''         Ms. Barr is survived by a daughter and a sister.       
         Wendy Wasserstein, who spoke for a generation of smart, driven but sometimes unsatisfied women in a series of popular plays that included the long-running Pulitzer Prize winner ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 55 and lived in New York.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, said Andr√© Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater.         Starting in 1977 with her breakthrough work, ''Uncommon Women and Others,'' Ms. Wasserstein's plays struck a profound chord with women struggling to reconcile a desire for romance and companionship, drummed into baby boomers by the seductive fantasies of Hollywood movies, with the need for intellectual independence and achievement separate from the personal sphere.         ''She was known for being a popular, funny playwright, but she was also a woman and a writer of deep conviction and political activism,'' Mr. Bishop said. ''In Wendy's plays women saw themselves portrayed in a way they hadn't been onstage before -- wittily, intelligently and seriously at the same time. We take that for granted now, but it was not the case 25 years ago. She was a real pioneer.''         The lights on Broadway are to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Her heroines -- intelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt -- sought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they didn't always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women's lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man. Ms. Wasserstein drew on her own experience as a smart, well-educated, funny Manhattanite who wasn't particularly lucky in romance to create heroines in a similar mold, women who embraced the essential tenets of the feminist movement but didn't have the stomach for stridency.         For Ms. Wasserstein, as for many of her characters and fans, humor was a necessary bulwark against the disappointments of life, and a useful release valve for anger at cultural and social inequities. Her work, which included three books of nonfiction and a forthcoming novel as well as about a dozen plays, had a significant influence on depictions of American women in the media landscape over the years: Heidi Holland, the steadily single, uncompromising heroine of ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' can be seen as the cultural progenitor of ''Sex and the City's'' Carrie Bradshaw. (Coincidentally, Sarah Jessica Parker, who starred in that HBO series, played a series of small roles in the original production of ''The Heidi Chronicles.'')         Ms. Wasserstein, who grew up in New York, recalled attending Broadway plays as a young woman and being struck by the absence of people like herself onstage: ''I remember going to them and thinking, I really like this, but where are the girls?'' she once said. Ms. Wasserstein would fill the stage with ''girls'' -- a term she used with a wink despite taking flak for it -- in a series of plays that pleased loyal audiences even when the critics did not always embrace them.         ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' her most celebrated and popular play, opened on Broadway in 1989 after receiving critical acclaim Off Broadway. It ran for 622 performances and collected the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play as well as the Pulitzer Prize. Joan Allen created the title role in the play, which toured nationally and was later filmed for television with Jamie Lee Curtis.         Reviewing the play in Newsday, Linda Winer called it ''a wonderful and important play.'' She continued, ''Smart, compassionate, witty, courageous, this one not only dares to ask the hard questions  but asks them with humor, exquisite clarity and great fullness of heart.''         Ranging across more than two decades, ''The Heidi Chronicles'' was an episodic, seriocomic biography of an art historian seeking to establish a fixed and fulfilling sense of identity amid the social convolutions of the 1960's and 70's, a period when the rulebook on relationships between men and women was being rewritten. Heidi's allegiance to her ideals and her unwillingness to compromise them for the sake of winning a man's attentions caused conflict with friends who chose easier or different paths. Looking around at her materialistic, married, self-obsessed peers two decades after the exhilarating birth of feminism, Heidi observes: ''We're all concerned, intelligent, good women. It's just that I feel stranded. And I thought the whole point was that we wouldn't feel stranded. I thought the point was that we were all in this together.''         In the play's bittersweet final scene, Heidi has become a single mother to a new infant -- a path Ms. Wasserstein would herself pursue many years later, ultimately at great physical cost, when she gave birth, at age 48, to her daughter, Lucy Jane, in 1999.         Her next play, ''The Sisters Rosensweig,'' brought the issues of ethnicity and religion into her continuing conversation about the making and remaking of women's identities as it focused on three sisters with different relationships to their Jewish roots. It opened on Broadway in 1993, ran for 556 performances and was nominated for a Tony Award for best play. Less successful was her 1997 play, ''An American Daughter,'' inspired by the harsh attacks on women in politics, which lasted only 89 performances on Broadway, though Ms. Wasserstein later adapted it for television.         Ms. Wasserstein's other plays were produced Off Broadway, and included ''Isn't It Romantic'' (originally produced, to mixed notices, in 1981 and revised in 1983, when it was largely acclaimed) and ''Old Money'' (2000), a time-traveling comedy about the well heeled. Her most recent play, ''Third,'' about a female professor who is forced to question her staunchly held ideas about politics and ethics, opened in the fall at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.         Ms. Wasserstein's abundant gift for comedy and her plays' popularity disguised the more serious ambitions underpinning her writing. ''My work is often thought of as lightweight commercial comedy,'' she told The Paris Review in 1997, ''and I have always thought, No, you don't understand: this is in fact a political act. 'The Sisters Rosensweig' had the largest advance in Broadway history,'' for a play (not a musical). Therefore, she continued, ''nobody is going to turn down a play on Broadway because a woman wrote it or because it's about women.'' When Ms. Wasserstein won the best-play Tony for ''Heidi Chronicles,'' it was the first time a woman had won the prize solo.         Ms. Wasserstein was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 18, 1950, the youngest of five siblings. Her father was a textile manufacturer, her mother an amateur dancer. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Wasserstein is survived by her mother, Lola Wasserstein; her brothers, Abner and Bruce, the chairman of the investment banking giant Lazard and the owner of New York magazine; and her sister Georgette Levis of Vermont. The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Wasserstein was 12. After earning her undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1971, she studied creative writing at City College with Joseph Heller and Israel Horovitz. Her first play, ''Any Woman Can't,'' found its way to Playwrights Horizons, then a small Off Broadway company, and was produced in 1973, shortly before she began to study playwriting in earnest at the Yale University School of Drama. (''My parents only let me go to drama school because it was Yale,'' she said in an interview for the magazine Bomb. ''They thought I'd marry a lawyer.'')         Ms. Wasserstein's career would be closely linked both with Playwrights Horizons, which under its artistic director, Mr. Bishop, would first produce ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and with many of the artists she met at Yale, including the designer Heidi Ettinger and the director James Lapine, who remained lifelong friends. (Mr. Bishop left Playwrights Horizons to move to Lincoln Center Theater, which has produced all her subsequent plays.) Ms. Wasserstein's classmate, the playwright Christopher Durang, was a particular friend; she used his introductory icebreaker -- ''You look so bored, you must be very bright'' -- directly in ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and they collaborated on a revue for the school's cabaret group.         After receiving a master's degree in fine arts in 1976, Ms. Wasserstein returned to Manhattan, and essentially never left. Her first major success came quickly, with ''Uncommon Women'' in 1977, produced by the Phoenix Theater. Depicting an informal reunion of a group of Mount Holyoke graduates that dissolves into scenes of their college days, it was described as ''funny, ironic and affectionate'' by Edith Oliver in The New Yorker, who added, ''Under the laughter there is  a feeling of bewilderment and disappointment over the world outside college, which promised so much, and with their own dreams, which seem to have stalled.'' The play, which was filmed and telecast on PBS's ''Great Performances,'' was also an important breakthrough in the careers of the actresses Glenn Close, Swoosie Kurtz and Meryl Streep, who played Ms. Close's role in the television version.         Ms. Wasserstein's other writing included a spoof of self-help literature, ''Sloth'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), and two books of essays, ''Bachelor Girls'' (Knopf, 1990) and ''Shiksa Goddess'' (Knopf, 2001), eclectic collections that embraced such disparate topics as Chekhov, her sister's battle with breast cancer, and the life and career of Mrs. Entenmann, creator of a bakery empire and fosterer of much guilt. Included in ''Shiksa Goddess'' was an essay Ms. Wasserstein wrote for The New Yorker, as poignant as it was hilarious, in which she discussed the medical complications of her late-life pregnancy and her newborn daughter's early struggles. ''Although I remain a religious skeptic,'' she wrote, referring to the disorienting days following Lucy Jane's premature birth, ''I had a kind of blind faith. I believed in the collaboration between the firm will of my one-pound-twelve-ounce daughter and the expertise of modern medicine. Of course, there was more than a bit of random luck involved, too.''         Lucy Jane will live with Ms. Wasserstein's brother Bruce.         Ms. Wasserstein also wrote a children's book, ''Pamela's First Musical,'' which she adapted for the stage in collaboration with Cy Coleman and David Zippel, and wrote the libretto for ''The Festival of Regrets,'' one of three one-act operas presented under the collective title ''Central Park'' at the New York City Opera. She had also completed a libretto for another opera with music by Deborah Drattell.         Ms. Wasserstein worked intermittently for Hollywood, although her sole produced screenplay credit was for ''The Object of My Affection,'' a 1998 romantic comedy that starred Jennifer Aniston. Her first novel, ''Elements of Style,'' is to be published by Knopf in April.         But the object of Ms. Wasserstein's deepest affection was always the stage, and her relationship with the theater permeated all aspects of her life. Her friendships in the theatrical community (and out of it) were wide and deep, and she generously gave of her time and resources to benefits of all kinds. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, she later served on the Guggenheim Foundation board, and she also taught playwriting at several universities.         In 1998, seeking to help instill her love for theater in a new generation of New Yorkers, she personally instigated a program to bring smart, underprivileged students from New York's public high schools to the theater. In an essay about the program for The New York Times, she wrote: ''As far as I'm concerned, every New Yorker is born with the inalienable right to ride the D train, shout 'Hey, lady!' with indignation and grow up going regularly to the theater. After all, if a city is fortunate enough to house an entire theater district, shouldn't access to the stage life within it be what makes coming of age in New York different from any other American city?''         The program, administered by the Theater Development Fund, has steadily expanded since Ms. Wasserstein first held a pizza party for eight students from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx after a matinee of ''On the Town.'' Now officially called Open Doors, it consists of 17 groups (more than 100 students), chaperoned to a season's worth of theater offerings by interested mentors.         Of course Ms. Wasserstein's devotion to theater took its purest and most enduring form in her writing for the stage, which allowed her the freedom to explore the evolving lives of American women with a fluidity and frankness that befitted the complex experience she was writing about. Although it was always laced with comedy, her work was also imbued with an abiding sadness, a cleareyed understanding that independence can beget loneliness, that rigorous ideals and raised consciousnesses are not always good company at the dinner table. But she shared her compassion among a wide array of characters, those who settled and those who continued to search.         ''No matter how lonely you get or how many birth announcements you receive,'' a character says in ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''the trick is not to get frightened. There's nothing wrong with being alone.'' The popularity of her work speaks for her ability to salve a little of that feeling of aloneness in her audiences with her deeply felt portraits of women -- and occasionally men -- seeking solidarity in their individuality, finding comfort in the knowledge that everybody else is sometimes uncomfortable with the choices they've made, too.       
         Birgit Nilsson, the Swedish soprano with a voice of impeccable trueness and impregnable stamina, died on Dec. 25 in Vastra Karup, the village where she was born, the Stockholm newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported yesterday. She was 87.         A funeral was held yesterday at a church in her town, the presiding vicar, Fredrik Westerlund, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Nilsson made so strong an imprint on a number of roles that her name came to be identified with a repertory, the ''Nilsson repertory,'' and it was a broad one. She sang the operas of Richard Strauss and made a specialty of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' but it was Wagner who served her career and whom she served as no other soprano since the days of Kirsten Flagstad.         A big, blunt woman with a wicked sense of humor, Ms. Nilsson brooked no interference from Wagner's powerful and eventful orchestra writing. When she sang Isolde or Br√ºnnhilde, her voice pierced through and climbed above it. Her performances took on more pathos as the years went by, but one remembers her sound more for its muscularity, accuracy and sheer joy of singing under the most trying circumstances.         Her long career at the Bayreuth Festival and her immersion in Wagner in general, began in the mid-1950's. No dramatic soprano truly approached her stature thereafter, and in the roles of Isolde, Br√ºnnhilde and Sieglinde, she began her stately 30-year procession around the opera houses of the world. Her United States debut was in San Francisco in 1956. Three years later she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, singing Isolde under Karl B√∂hm, and some listeners treasure the memory of that performance as much as they do her live recording of the role from Bayreuth in 1966, also under B√∂hm. The exuberant review of her first Met performance appeared on the front page of The New York Times on Dec. 19, 1959, under the headline, ''Birgit Nilsson as Isolde Flashes Like New Star in 'Met' Heavens.''         Playing opposite Karl Liebl as Tristan, Howard Taubman wrote, ''she dominated the stage and the performance.''         When she appeared at the end of the first act to take a solo bow, he wrote, the audience ''roared like the Stadium fans when Conerly throws a winning touchdown pass.''         Like so many distinctive artists, Ms. Nilsson considered herself self-taught. ''The best teacher is the stage,'' she told an interviewer in 1981. ''You walk out onto it, and you have to learn to project.'' She deplored her early instruction and attributed her survival to native talent. ''My first voice teacher almost killed me,'' she said. ''The second was almost as bad.''         Birgit Nilsson was born in 1918. Her mother, evidently a talented singer, began Ms. Nilsson's musical education at 3, buying her a toy piano. She began picking out melodies on it.         She once told an interviewer that she could sing before she could walk. ''I even sang in my dreams,'' she added. A choirmaster near her home heard her sing and advised her to study. She entered the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm in 1941.         Ms. Nilsson made her debut at the Royal Opera in Stockholm in 1946, replacing the scheduled Agathe in Weber's ''Freisch√ºtz,'' who was too ill to go on. The next year she claimed attention there as Verdi's Lady Macbeth under Fritz Busch. A wealth of parts followed, from Strauss and Verdi to Wagner, Puccini and Tchaikovsky.         Her first splash abroad was 1951, as Elettra in Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' at the Glyndebourne Festival in England. From there, it was a short hop to the Vienna State Opera and then to Bayreuth. She took the title role of ''Turandot,'' which is brief but in need of an unusually big sound, to Milan in 1958 and then to the rest of Italy.         Ms. Nilsson was suspicious of opera's recent youth culture and often remarked on the premature destruction of young voices brought on by overambitious career planning. ''Directors and managers don't care about their futures,'' she once said. ''They will just get another young person when this one goes bad.''         In today's opera culture, the best managed voices tend to mature in the singer's 40's and begin to deteriorate during the 50's. (Singers like Pl√°cido Domingo, flourishing in his 60's, might dispute such generalizations.) Yet at 66, when most singers hang onto whatever career remains through less taxing recitals with piano and discreet downward transpositions of key, Ms. Nilsson sang a New York concert performance of Strauss and Wagner that met both composers head-on.         ''Ms. Nilsson did not sound young,'' Will Crutchfield wrote in The Times. ''Soft and low notes were often precarious; sustained tones were not always steady.'' He continued: ''The wonderful thing is that she doesn't let this bother her. There was never a sense of distress or worry.''         The conductor Erich Leinsdorf thought that her longevity, like Flagstad's, had something to do with her Scandinavian heritage, remarking that Wagner required ''thoughtful, patient and methodical people.'' Ms. Nilsson attributed her long career to no particular lifestyle or regimen. ''I do nothing special,'' she once said. ''I don't smoke. I drink a little wine and beer. I was born with the right set of parents.''         In sheer power, Ms. Nilsson's high notes were sometimes compared to those of the Broadway belter Ethel Merman. One high C rendered in a ''Turandot'' performance in the outdoor Arena di Verona in Italy led citizenry beyond the walls to think that a fire alarm had been set off. Once urged to follow Ms. Nilsson in the same role at the Met, the eminent soprano Leonie Rysanek refused.         Ms. Nilsson was known for her one-liner humor. The secret to singing Isolde, she said, was ''comfortable shoes.'' After a disagreement with the Australian soprano Joan Sutherland, Ms. Nilsson was asked if she thought Ms. Sutherland's famous bouffant hairdo was real. She answered: ''I don't know. I haven't pulled it yet.'' After the tenor Franco Corelli was said to have bitten her neck in an onstage quarrel over held notes, Ms. Nilsson canceled performances complaining that she had rabies.         Ms. Nilsson was also a shrewd businesswoman and negotiated much of her own career. She never ranted or engaged in tantrums. She was also too proud to make outright demands. She would begin contract talks by refusing every offer and being evasive about her availability in general. This tack would continue until the impresario offered something she wanted. Ms. Nilsson's reply would be ''maybe.'' Now in control, she would be begged to accept what she desired in the first place.         She could stand up to intensely wired conductors like Georg Solti as well. When Solti, in ''Tristan und Isolde,'' insisted on tempos too slow for her taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a conductorial change of heart.         Partly because Ms. Nilsson was on the scene, Decca Records undertook the audacious and mammothly expensive project of making the first studio recording of Wagner's four-opera ''Ring'' cycle conducted by Solti and produced by John Culshaw. The effort took seven years, from 1958 to 1965. A film of the proceedings made her a familiar image for arts-conscious television viewers.         Ms. Nilsson's American career was derailed in the mid-70's by a squabble with the Internal Revenue Service, which had filed claims for back taxes. Several years later, cooler heads intervened: a schedule of payments was worked out, and Ms. Nilsson's ill-tempered hiatus from the United States ended. When she returned, Donal Henahan wrote in The Times, ''The famous shining trumpet of a voice is still far from sounding like a cornet.''         Ms. Nilsson appeared at the Met 223 times in 16 roles. She sang two complete ''Ring'' cycles in the 1961-62 season, and another in 1974-75. She was Isolde 33 times, and Turandot 52. The big soprano parts were all hers: Aida, Tosca, the Dyer's Wife in Strauss's ''Frau Ohne Schatten,'' Salome, Elektra, Lady Macbeth, Leonore in Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' and both Venus and Elisabeth in Wagner's ''Tannh√§user.'' For much of this time, the Met's general manager was Rudolf Bing. Ms. Nilsson, when signing a contract, was asked to name a dependent. She wrote in Bing's name.         James Levine, who conducted her in Wagner and Strauss at the Met, said yesterday: ''Birgit was unique. Her voice, the dedication of her artistry, her wonderfully wicked sense of humor and her loyal friendship were in a class by themselves. I miss her already, as does the entire Met family.'' At Mr. Levine's 25th-anniversary gala at the Met in 1996, she spoke briefly and wittily, throwing in a brief and wholly professional Valkyrie hoot at the end.         Ms. Nilsson had by then retired to her childhood home in the Skane province of southern Sweden. Here her father had been a sixth-generation farmer, and here she had worked to grow beets and potatoes until she was 23. A decade ago an interviewer for The Times found her there: happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. ''I've always tried to remember what my mother used to tell me,'' she said. ''Stay close to the earth. Then when you fall down, it won't hurt so much.''       
         Shelley Winters, who once described her life as a ''rocky road out of the Brooklyn ghetto to one New York apartment, two Oscars, three California houses, four hit plays, five Impressionist paintings, six mink coats and 99 films,'' died yesterday. She was 83, although some sources say she was 85.         Ms. Winters died of heart failure at the Rehabilitation Centre of Beverly Hills, her publicist, Dale Olson, said. She had been hospitalized in October after suffering a heart attack.         A major movie presence for more than five decades, Shelley Winters turned herself from a self-described ''dumb blond bombshell'' in B pictures to a widely respected actress who was nominated four times for Academy Awards.         Her first Oscar, for best supporting actress, was for her performance in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959) as the middle-age Mrs. Van Daan, one of eight Dutch Jews hiding from the Nazis in an attic.         She won again for best supporting actress as the vicious mother of a blind girl in ''A Patch of Blue'' (1965).         After a series of bit parts, Ms. Winters received her first big break as the waitress who was strangled by Ronald Colman's jealous actor in ''A Double Life'' in 1947.         Four years later, she dyed her hair brown, rubbed the polish off her fingernails, and convinced the director George Stevens that she could play the mousy factory girl who was made pregnant and then drowned by Montgomery Clift so that he could marry the rich Elizabeth Taylor in ''A Place in the Sun.'' She was nominated for an Academy Award as best actress for that performance.         Tough-talking and oozing sex appeal, Ms. Winters was blowzy, vulgar and often pathetically vulnerable in her early films. In movie after movie, she played working-class women who were violently discarded by men who had used them.         When her gullible waitress couldn't lead the hymn-singing preacher to a cache of stolen money in ''The Night of the Hunter'' (1955), he slit her throat.         As a rich man's poor mistress in ''The Great Gatsby'' (1949), she was casually run over by her lover's wife.         In Stanley Kubrick's ''Lolita'' (1962), James Mason married her to get close to her young daughter; when she finds this out she blindly runs in front of a car and is killed.         Even when she became the dominating force in many of her later movies, Ms. Winters often played vulnerable monsters. As Ma Barker in the 1970 cult classic ''Bloody Mama'' -- in which she is first seen giving her four grown sons their Saturday-night baths -- she was murderously maternal while brandishing a tommy gun.         Shrieking, shrewish, slutty or silly, Ms. Winters always seemed larger than life on screen. The critic Pauline Kael called her lovelorn culture-vulture Charlotte Haze in ''Lolita'' a ''triumphant caricature, so overdone it recalls Blake's 'You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough.' ''         Off screen Ms. Winters lived with an equal gusto, which she captured in her best-selling 1980 autobiography, ''Shelley, Also Known as Shirley,'' and in a second book, ''Shelley II.'' With a hearty appetite for food and men, she was not hesitant about naming the actors with whom she had shared a bed, including Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Farley Granger, Sterling Hayden, William Holden and Burt Lancaster. Ms. Winters and Mr. Holden had a ''Same Time, Next Year'' relationship, meeting in his Paramount dressing room on Christmas Eve for five years. Her two- year relationship with Mr. Lancaster  was more serious. She ended the affair when the actor's wife became pregnant with his third child.         She was born Shirley Schrift in St. Louis on Aug. 18, 1922, according to many sources, though others give her birth year as 1920. Her stage name came from the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and from her mother, Rose Winter, an amateur soprano who had once won a Municipal Opera contest in St. Louis. Her father, like many immigrants in the early 20th century, came to the United States in steerage. Her mother, a first-generation American, was born in St. Louis. The Schrifts soon moved to Brooklyn, where Ms. Winters grew up.         When her father went to Sing Sing for arson (he was exonerated later), 9-year-old Shirley retreated into a fantasy world that, Ms. Winters wrote, ''has been a powerful tool in my acting'' but ''used to play hell with my real life.'' In junior high school she discovered she could sneak into Broadway theaters during Wednesday matinees; she never again went to school on Wednesday afternoons.         As a teenager, wearing high heels borrowed from her older sister, Blanche, and with six powder puffs stuffed into her bra, she auditioned during a nationwide search for an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' The director George Cukor was kind. Go to acting school, he told her, and become known on the New York stage. She took his advice. Less than a decade later, Cukor cast Ms. Winters as the sexy waitress who serves more than dinner in ''A Double Life.''         A high school dropout, Ms. Winters modeled in the garment industry by day and attended the New Theater School at night, and spent two summers doing sketches on the borscht circuit in the Catskills. She got hired for the chorus of Broadway musicals because she was funny and could sing, but then she got fired because she couldn't dance. She landed a part in the national company of ''Meet the People'' in 1941.         Soon afterward, Max Reinhardt was preparing ''Rosalinda,'' his English-language version of ''Die Fledermaus.'' Charmed by the brash Brooklyn girl who had no idea she was auditioning for an opera, the director gave her a small comic role, which he kept enlarging. When the president of Columbia Pictures, Harry Cohn, saw the show, he arranged for a screen test.         Hollywood was not immediately overwhelmed. As a Columbia contract player earning $100 a week, Ms. Winters made her 1943 film debut with one line in ''What a Woman!'' She took acting lessons at the studio and joined the Actor's Lab to study real acting at night.         Ms. Winters played a harem girl in ''A Thousand and One Nights'' (1945), was lent to Samuel Goldwyn to play the heroine's younger sister in the film version of ''Knickerbocker Holiday'' (1944) and was jettisoned by Columbia after a year for not being ''movie material.''         Finally, ''A Double Life'' gave her a lift. ''To this day I feel that getting 'A Double Life' was a miracle,'' she wrote in her autobiography. ''So much of a successful career depends on standing on the right corner at the exact right moment.''         A seven-year contract with Universal Studios was the reward for her performance in ''A Double Life.'' Ms. Winters played gangsters' girlfriends (''Larceny,'' ''Johnny Stool Pigeon''); a bad-girl cabaret singer whose piano player is Liberace (''South Sea Sinner''); the Marlene Dietrich role in a warmed-over-lightly version of ''Destry Rides Again'' (''Frenchie''); a better-quality nightclub singer who is the object of Frank Sinatra's affections (''Meet Danny Wilson''); a waitress in the Old West married to bad guy (''Untamed Frontier''), and a number of other good/bad girls. As a dance-hall girl In ''Winchester '73,'' her co-stars were James Stewart and a rifle.         For a while, Ms. Winters shared an apartment in Hollywood with a painfully insecure Marilyn Monroe. At night Ms. Winters studied acting with Charles Laughton, who borrowed her from Universal while he directed ''The Night of the Hunter.''         In 1955 Ms. Winters returned to New York. She formally joined the Actors Studio (she had sat in on classes a few years earlier) and starred on Broadway with Ben Gazzara and Anthony Franciosa in the Studio-created hit play ''A Hatful of Rain,'' about the taboo subject of drug abuse.         During the 1960's Ms. Winters found her m√©tier as a character actress. In addition to her Oscar-winning roles, she played the mother of a murderer in ''The Young Savages'' (1961); a middle-age woman who throws away a happy marriage for a handsome young man in ''The Chapman Report'' (1962); Michael Caine's voracious bedmate in ''Alfie'' (1966), and an ex-movie star who has made a bad choice in husbands in ''Harper'' (1966).         Ms. Winters's fourth and last Oscar nomination came in 1972, for her supporting role in ''The Poseidon Adventure.'' She played a former swimming champion who sacrifices her life to help save fellow passengers on a doomed ship, although reviewers found it hard to accept the stout Ms. Winters in the part. The publicity department at 20th Century Fox announced that the studio had told Ms. Winters to gain 30 pounds for her role in ''The Poseidon Adventure.'' But by the 1970's she had simply lost her lifelong struggle to control her weight.         Ms. Winters never stopped working, dividing her time among movies, plays and television. In films she played the witch in ''Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?'' (1971); the perfect Jewish mother in ''Next Stop, Greenwich Village'' (1976); the mother of a fat boy in ''Heavy'' (1995); and Nicole Kidman's selfish aunt in Jane Campion's ''Portrait of a Lady'' (1996). In the sitcom ''Roseanne'' she played Roseanne's grandmother. An early marriage during World War II to an Army Air Force captain, Paul Mayer, lasted until the war ended. Ms. Winters married the Italian actor Vittorio Gassman in 1952. The couple divorced in 1954 after the birth of her daughter and only child, Vittoria, who is now a physician working in Connecticut. In 1957 Ms. Winters married Mr. Franciosa, her co-star in ''A Hatful of Rain.'' That marriage ended in 1960. Ms. Winters is survived by her companion of 19 years, Jerry DeFord; her daughter, Dr. Vittoria Gassman of Norwalk, Conn.; and two grandchildren.         If, during her last years, Ms. Winters fit more comfortably into a muumuu than a sheath, she never lost her sense of laughing delight in what the world had given a poor girl from Brooklyn. In 1996 she defined herself to an interviewer as ''a senior-citizen sex bomb.'' She added: ''I get 1,000 letters a month. I send people a postcard of myself in short hair and a checkered blouse that was taken 50 years ago.''       
         Joan Maynard, who shepherded the preservation of the remnants of Weeksville, a once-thriving 19th-century community of free blacks in Brooklyn that had faded from maps and memory, died on Sunday at her home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. She was 77.         Her death was confirmed by Pamela Green, her successor as executive director of the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History.         The story of Weeksville's discovery and preservation sounds like a fairy tale with Ms. Maynard as its guardian angel. The settlement began in the 1830's when escaped slaves and free blacks bought property there. It quickly became a thriving community with schools, churches, an orphanage and one of the nation's first black newspapers, The Freedman's Torchlight.         Among the 19th-century residents of Weeksville was Susan McKinney Steward, who in 1870 became the first female African-American physician in New York State.         But by 1968, few remembered Weeksville, much less where it had been. A historian leading a workshop at Pratt Institute, James Hurley, had seen references to the community in archives, but in many walks he had found no sign of it.         Then, Joe Haynes, a volunteer pilot, took Mr. Hurley up in his plane to make an aerial photograph. It showed four wood-frame cottages hidden in an alley once called Hunterfly Road.         The same year, Ms. Maynard became a founding member of the Weeksville Society and served as president from 1972 until 1974, when she became executive director.         In 1969, college students and students from a nearby public school did an archaeological dig nearby and found artifacts that included a slave's shackles. The following year, a busload of schoolchildren, accompanied by experts, went to the city Landmarks Preservation Commission to ask that Weeksville be given landmark status.         That was granted. Weeksville was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.         The challenges to restoring Weeksville were numerous. A car crashed into one house, another had to be completely rebuilt, and vandals gutted another.         Ms. Maynard persisted, taking slides to scores of schools and community groups to win support. She pieced together financing from governments, corporations and children collecting pennies. She donated all her personal savings.         Decades of her hard work were rewarded in June 2005 when the houses of Weeksville were opened to the public after a $3 million renovation. At that time, the society changed its name to the Weeksville Heritage Center.         ''They look just like what they were meant to be,'' Charles Hill, who lived in the Kingsborough Houses across the street for many years said of the houses in an interview with The Daily News.         Such expressions of pride mattered to Ms. Maynard, whose oft-stated mission was nurturing a sense of identity among black children by concretely linking them to their history.         ''The kids have to learn they're not trash,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1991.         In a neighborhood that had seen its share of troubles, she pulled no punches: a tree she planted behind one of the cottages commemorated a murdered young man who was involved in Weeksville programs as a boy.         When some suggested that many more people could view the cottages if they were moved from the edge of Crown Heights, just south of Bedford-Stuyvesant, she refused.         ''It needs to be here, where many of the people have no knowledge of their own history,'' she told The Times in 1996.         Joan Cooper was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 29, 1928. Her father, John Cooper, a ventriloquist, and mother, the former Julia St. Bernard, told her stories about the oppression of blacks. In an interview with The Times in 1991, she recalled them discussing a newspaper story about the lynching of a pregnant black woman.         She graduated from Empire State College of the State University of New York and worked as a commercial artist for McGraw-Hill and other companies. She drew covers for Crisis, the publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as well as comic book treatments of black history.         Among the many awards she received was the Louise DuPont Crowninshield Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, of which she had been a trustee. She retired in 1999, but continued to promote Weeksville.         Ms. Maynard was married twice, once to a man named Bacchus and once to one named Maynard, and divorced twice. Her son, Jerome, died before her, and she leaves no immediate survivors.         One of the items found in the archaeological digs at Weeksville was a tintype of a dignified woman, elegantly dressed in tidy hat, fitted bodice and spectacles. Ms. Maynard chose the image as the symbol of Weeksville.         ''When I look at her eyes, she talks to me,'' Ms. Maynard said. ''She says, 'I existed. I care.' ''       
         Andrea M. Bronfman, an internationally noted philanthropist, died on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan. She was 60 and had homes in Manhattan; Palm Beach, Fla.; and Jerusalem.         The police said that Mrs. Bronfman died of injuries she sustained after she was struck by a livery cab early Monday morning while walking her dog on East 65th Street.         The wife of Charles R. Bronfman, of the Seagram empire, Mrs. Bronfman was a co-chairman of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies. She was known in particular for her involvement with Jewish causes in the United States, Canada and Israel.         Mrs. Bronfman was also a founder of the Gift of New York, which through the spring of 2003 provided free tickets to cultural and sporting events to the families of Sept. 11 victims.         Andrea Brett Morrison, known as Andy, was born in London on May 30, 1945, the daughter of an American mother, Doris, and a Scottish father, Hyam, who ran a women's clothing business. Both were deeply involved in Jewish and Zionist affairs; frequent visitors to the family home included David Ben-Gurion, Shimon Peres and Golda Meir.         After working briefly as a secretary in London, Andrea married David Cohen, and moved with him to Canada. The marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Bronfman in 1982.         Mrs. Bronfman was a trustee of many organizations, among them the Jewish Museum and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. Her other work included founding the Association of Israel's Decorative Arts and creating a traveling exhibition, ''A Coat of Many Colours: Two Centuries of Jewish Life in Canada,'' which was shown in New York at the Jewish Museum in 1993.         Besides her husband, a retired co-chairman of the Seagram Company, Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a sister, Marcia Flanders, of Montreal; three children from her first marriage, Jeremy Cohen of Manhattan, Pippa Cohen of Manhattan and Tony Cohen of Toronto; two stepchildren, Stephen Bronfman of Montreal and Ellen Hauptman of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.       
         Endesha Ida Mae Holland, a noted scholar and dramatist whose best-known play, ''From the Mississippi Delta,'' chronicled her journey from poverty and prostitution in the Jim Crow South to civil rights activism, a Ph.D. and an academic career, died on Jan. 25 at nursing home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 61.         The cause was complications of ataxia, a degenerative neurological condition, according to the University of Southern California, where she was an emeritus professor of theater. Professor Holland, who retired from U.S.C. in 2003, previously taught in the American studies department at the State University of New York, Buffalo.         Partly financed by Oprah Winfrey, the Off Broadway production of ''From the Mississippi Delta'' opened in 1991 at the Circle in the Square Downtown. Directed by Jonathan Wilson, it starred Cheryl Lynn Bruce, Sybil Walker and Jacqueline Williams in the principal role, which depicted the author at various stages of her life.         Though it ran for 218 performances, the production received a mixed reception from critics. Few, however, disputed the hypnotic pull of Professor Holland's story. Ida Mae Holland -- she added Endesha as an adult -- was born on Aug. 29, 1944, in the Delta town of Greenwood, Miss. She was reared along with several siblings in a wooden shack, its walls plastered with newspapers. She never knew her father; her mother, an esteemed rural midwife, sometimes took in local prostitutes as boarders to make ends meet.         When Ida Mae was 11, in an incident she often recounted afterward, she was raped by a white man who employed her as a baby sitter. When it was over, he handed her $5.         ''I knew I was a woman then,'' Professor Holland told Ebony magazine in 1992. ''And since I didn't want to go to the cotton fields and work all day, I figured this was a way that I could make money. And I started turning tricks.'' The going rate, she said, was $5 for black men, $10 for white.         By her late teens, she had been arrested many times for street fighting, shoplifting and prostitution. One day, looking for a customer, she followed a young man to his office. He turned out to be a volunteer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which had come to Greenwood to register black voters.         ''I saw and heard things in that office I had never seen or heard before,'' Professor Holland told Ebony. ''I had never seen black people sitting down using typewriters or heard black people talking about civil rights or voter registration.''         She became involved with the organization, marching, speaking and registering voters, and was jailed 13 times for her activities. In 1965, a suspicious fire broke out in her family's home, killing her mother. Professor Holland said afterward that she believed the Ku Klux Klan had firebombed the house in retaliation for her civil rights work.         Encouraged by colleagues in the movement, Ida Mae obtained a high school equivalency diploma and enrolled at the University of Minnesota. She earned a bachelor's degree in African-American studies there in 1979, followed by a master's in American Studies in 1984 and a Ph.D., also in American studies, in 1986. Professor Holland taught at Buffalo from 1985 to 1993.         The author of a half-dozen plays, Professor Holland remained famous for ''From the Mississippi Delta,'' which has been performed by the Negro Ensemble Company, at the Goodman Theater in Chicago and at the Young Vic in London. She wrote a memoir of the same name, published by Simon & Schuster in 1997.         Professor Holland's three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by a sister, Jean Beasley; a brother, Charlie Nellums; a son, Cedric; and a granddaughter, according to the University of Southern California.       
         Edna Lewis, the granddaughter of a former slave whose cookbooks revived the nearly forgotten genre of refined Southern cooking while offering a glimpse into African-American farm life in the early 20th century, died yesterday. She was 89.         Miss Lewis, as she was always called, died in her sleep in her home in Decatur, Ga., said Scott Peacock, her friend and caretaker. Mr. Peacock, a chef, had lived with Miss Lewis for more than six years, taking care of her as she grew frail.         Despite a quiet demeanor, Miss Lewis had a reach that extended from her family farm in Virginia, to left-wing politics in Manhattan to the birthplace of California cuisine.         Edna Lewis was born in a small settlement called Freetown in 1916, one of eight children. The farm had been granted to her grandfather, a freed slave. Growing, gathering and preparing food was more than just sustenance for the family; it was a form of entertainment. Without fancy cooking equipment, the family improvised, measuring baking powder on coins and cooking everything over wood.         In 1976, Miss Lewis turned the focused, close-to-nature cooking of her childhood into the first of her four books, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf). The book, considered a classic study of Southern cooking and one that sits on the shelves of America's best chefs, helped put an end to the knee-slapping, cornpone image of Southern food among many American cooks.         John T. Edge, the author and director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, said that because of her devotion to educating a nation about the nuances of Southern cooking, there was no question that the group's first lifetime achievement award, in 1999, would go to Miss Lewis.         He pointed to her recipe for shrimp and grits, a Southern classic. ''It's just butter and shrimp, but it requires great butter and great shrimp, and a puddle of that over stone-ground grits,'' he said. ''This pays homage to the frugal South, but it's also worthy of damask dinner cloth.''         Throughout her life, the politics of race and the swirl of New York drew Miss Lewis with a pull as strong as her Southern roots. She took a bus to New York when she was in her early 30's, eager for work but restricted by the racial attitudes of the times. An acquaintance found her a job in a laundry in Brooklyn, where she was assigned to an ironing board. She had never ironed and lasted three hours before a manager showed her to the door.         She sewed better than she ironed and was soon copying Dior dresses for Dorcas Avedon, then the wife of Richard Avedon. She made a dress for Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Peacock said, as well as the African-inspired dresses that became her signature.         In New York, she married Steve Kingston, a retired merchant seaman and a Communist. Shortly afterward, she became acquainted with John Nicholson, an antiques dealer who in 1949 decided to open a restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan. She became the cook, preparing cheese souffl√©s and roast chicken. Caf√© Nicholson became an instant success among fashionistas, bohemians and artists.         She remained at the restaurant until the late 1950's, during which she and her husband would argue over its bourgeois character.         ''He used to always say, 'This restaurant should be for ordinary people on the street. You're catering to capitalists,' '' Mr. Nicholson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. ''It was such a bore.'' Miss Lewis left Caf√© Nicolson in 1954, and the couple tried a number of ventures, including running a pheasant farm.         In the mid-1970's, while sidelined by a broken leg, Miss Lewis began writing a cookbook. With encouragement from Judith Jones, the cookbook editor at Knopf who also edited Julia Childs, Miss Lewis turned her handwritten pages into ''The Taste of Country Cooking.'' In 1979, Craig Claiborne of The Times said the book ''may well be the most entertaining regional cookbook in America.''         In a 1989 interview with The Times, Miss Lewis said: ''As a child in Virginia, I thought all food tasted delicious. After growing up, I didn't think food tasted the same, so it has been my lifelong effort to try and recapture those good flavors of the past.''         That dedication to purity of ingredients, taste and authenticity endeared her to Alice Waters and many other chefs. Ms. Waters, whose restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley defined California cuisine in the 1980's, said Miss Lewis was uncompromising but subtle in her approach to food and politics alike.         ''She just had a very quiet way of speaking, and it really engaged you because she was so soft-spoken; you have to listen carefully,'' Ms. Waters said. ''There was a kind of intimacy that you immediately had.''         Ms. Jones, who edited three books by Miss Lewis, recalled her yesterday as a lover of Jack Daniel's, Bessie Smith and understated conversation. ''She had a tremendous sense of dignity in the face of often difficult treatment,'' Ms. Jones said.         After ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' raised her profile, Miss Lewis returned to restaurants, most notably to Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. She remained there for almost 20 years, retiring in 1995. Her husband had died as she completed her first book, Ms. Jones said.         Along with friends, she founded the Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern Food, dedicated in part to seeing that people did not forget how to cook with lard.         One member of the group was Mr. Peacock, whom Miss Lewis met in 1990 while he was cooking at the Georgia governor's mansion. The two developed a deep friendship, collaborating on the book ''The Gift of Southern Cooking'' (Knopf) and teaching cooking classes. Their long association -- between a young, white, gay Southern chef and a widowed African-American doyenne -- earned them the nickname The Odd Couple of Southern Cooking.         As Miss Lewis aged, Mr. Peacock became her caretaker, causing a split with her surviving brothers and sisters, who waged an unsuccessful legal battle to move her to the family home in Unionville, Va., a town about 70 miles southwest of Washington.         Miss Lewis's dispute with her siblings became well known in the food world, most of whose members supported her and Mr. Peacock, seeing him as an eager student to a master of Southern cooking.         ''One of the biggest goals they had was that they didn't want to lose the classic Southern dishes, and this was the binding factor,'' Marion Cunningham, the grande dame of home cooking, said in an interview with The Times in 2004. ''They preached about it, and they wanted to let the country know what the South stood for.''         One sister, Ruth Lewis Smith, and a brother, George Lewis, both of Unionville, survive Miss Lewis, as does a stepsister, Bessie Jones of Philadelphia. She is also survived by Dr. Afeworki Paulos, a lecturer at the University of Michigan, whom she adopted as a young adult in 1986 shortly after he had arrived from Eritrea to study in the United States.         Dr. Paulos said his mother possessed a clear-headed sense of equality and fairness. ''I always say, yeah, the cooking is there,'' he said yesterday, ''but the way I remember her is as a woman who was very deeply involved in social issues.''         Mr. Peacock plans to hold a private memorial service for Miss Lewis in the Atlanta area. She will be buried in a family plot in Unionville.         Correction:  February 16, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Edna Lewis, the chef and author who wrote about refined Southern cuisine, misstated the order of her cookbooks. Her most famous one, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf, 1976), was her second, not her first. ''The Edna Lewis Cookbook'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972) was her first.         Because of an editing error, the obituary misstated Miss Lewis's tenure as chef at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. It was 5 years, not 20. In some copies, also because of an editing error, the obituary misstated the surname of the cookbook author who, like Miss Lewis, had been edited by Judith Jones at Knopf. She was Julia Child, not Childs.       
         Dai Ailian, the doyenne of dance in China, who as founder of the Beijing Dance Academy and director of its affiliated National Ballet combined her ballet and modern-dance training in the West with pioneering research into China's folk traditions, died on Feb. 9 in Beijing. She was 89 and had divided her time in recent years between Beijing and London.         Her death was reported by The Independent in London and The Shenzhen Daily in China.         Ms. Dai was a familiar figure in international dance circles, first as a dancer and choreographer who performed in London in the 1930's and in New York in the 40's, then as the guiding force in China's first state-sponsored national ballet institutions after the Communist government came to power in 1949.         In her remarkable life's journey, she both established ballet in China and introduced the country's little-known ethnic traditions abroad. When the Central Ballet of China, as the National Ballet of China was then called, made its New York debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1986, Mayor Edward I. Koch paid tribute to Ms. Dai from the stage.         Born in Trinidad and of Chinese descent, Ms. Dai spoke no Chinese when she left London, where she had been studying, for China at the end of 1939. At the outbreak of World War II, the China Institute in London offered to repatriate Chinese students living there.         Ms. Dai was included although she was several generations removed from China: her great-grandparents, she said, immigrated to Trinidad, where she was born on May 10, 1916. ''I had never been to China, but being Chinese, I always wanted to go,'' she said. ''My interest was to discover the Chinese dance and to develop it.''         After early training in Trinidad, Ms. Dai and her two sisters had been taken by their mother to London in 1931 to study ballet with Anton Dolin. A former star of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Dolin kept up his connection with Ms. Dai, and in 1983 he staged his showpiece ballet ''Variations for Four'' for the Central Ballet.         In London, Ms. Dai also studied ballet with two other well-known teachers, Margaret Craske and Marie Rambert. Her modern-dance training was mainly of the German Expressionist persuasion, as her mentors were Kurt Jooss, Sigurd Leeder, Rudolf von Laban and Ernest Berke. She learned the dance notation system known as Labanotation, which she introduced into China.         As a choreographer, dancer and director, Ms. Dai drew upon this diverse background throughout her career. Her first activities in China after giving concerts for war relief in Hong Kong in 1940 were devoted to researching folk dances of China's minority peoples in various regions. At this time she married the distinguished painter Ye Qianyu. They were divorced in 1956.         As a prominent figure in dance before 1949 who was not averse to choreographing works in support of China's new regime, Ms. Dai was a natural choice to lead the dance institutions she helped develop. In 1949, she was named deputy director of the Central Song and Dance Ensemble, and in 1954 she founded the Beijing Dance Academy, becoming its principal in 1955. She also headed China's first major ballet company, the Experimental Ballet Troupe, which was reorganized as the Central Ballet of China in 1959. She was the company's deputy director, then director in 1963 and '64, until she was removed during the Cultural Revolution and reportedly did manual labor; her second husband, Ding Ning, a dancer, divorced her during the Cultural Revolution. She was reinstated as artistic adviser in 1978.         An elegant woman who retained her British accent, she traveled to international dance events and was a juror at the 1990 New York International Ballet Competition. She restaged some of her works in 1989 for the London-based Chinese Dance and Mime Theater. In 1981, the Royal Academy of Dance placed a bust of her in its London foyer.       
         Jill Fraser, owner and artistic director of the Watermill Theater in Newbury, England, whose renown and influence far exceeds its size, died on Feb. 10. She was 59.         Although she had been battling cancer for four years, Ms. Fraser died of pneumonia at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, her husband and partner in the theater, James Sargant, said.         The couple, both of whom had deep roots in theatrical administration, bought the theater, a converted 19th-century corn, paper and water mill on the Lambourn River in West Berkshire just outside Newbury in 1981, a year after they were married.         Almost single-handedly, she transformed it from a tiny playhouse with a 26-week repertory to a year-round theater and propelled it onto the international stage, sending productions to London's West End, Broadway and more than two dozen countries. In fact, Ms. Fraser came to New York in November for the consecutive openings of ''Sweeney Todd'' and ''A Winter's Tale,'' both of which had originated in her theater. She was known for nurturing emerging talent. One of her most successful collaborations was with Edward Hall, Sir Peter Hall's son, who established the Propeller Theater, an all-male Shakespearean troupe at the Watermill Theater.         Not only did the couple work at the Watermill Theater, but they also made it their home. ''We lived in the miller's house; the tide barn where corn was stored is a restaurant and what was the stable is the accommodation for the people working here,'' Mr. Sargant said.         Jill Fraser was born in London, a daughter of Alec and Guinevere Fraser. Though she decided to pursue a career in theater, unlike her parents, both actors, she preferred to work backstage, taking a stage management course at the Central School of Speech and Drama. She went on to a career in administration at institutions like the Welsh Opera, the Cambridge Theater Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company.         She is survived by her husband; her mother; her son, Sam, 23, and her daughter, Charley, 21.         Planning to step down by 2008, Ms. Fraser and Mr. Sargant put the theater up for sale and helped establish a trust that is raising money to buy it.         ''We decided the time had come,'' Mr. Sargant said. ''You can get stale, which is why Jill liked working with young directors and designers. And we decided that we would not want to continue living here with everything going on around us.''       
         Sybille Bedford, whose first novel won high praise among England's literary elite and earned her a place in its most celebrated and exclusive literary circles, died Feb. 17 at a hospital near her home in London. She was 94.         Her death was announced by English PEN, part of the international society of writers, of which she was vice president at her death.         Ms. Bedford, who was German by birth and whose first language was German, wrote in English. In 53 years she published at least 10 books, many of them works that are combinations of biography, memoir or fact and not easily classifiable in any particular genre.         Though her works were not always widely popular, they inspired a deeply fervent following of committed admirers, starting with her first published work, ''A Sudden View,'' in 1953. Later retitled ''A Visit to Don Otavio,'' it was an account of her journey through Mexico.         Ms. Bedford's first published work of fiction, ''A Legacy'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1956), about aristocratic society in Germany before World War I, was heavily influenced by her own upbringing and gained attention after Evelyn Waugh's laudatory review of it in The Standard.         ''Written with an air of authority which compels acceptance, a novel has just appeared by a new writer of remarkable accomplishment,'' he wrote at the time. He called it ''a book of entirely delicious quality.''         The book was also well reviewed by Nancy Mitford, Aldous Huxley and other highly respected authors of the day. Their praise immediately elevated Ms. Bedford's literary reputation and made the book a commercial success. Her prose, called elegant by even her harshest critics, was compared to that of Marcel Proust, Henry James and Thomas Mann.         ''A Legacy'' and her three later novels were not universally celebrated. Critics sometimes found them lacking in character development and said that her plots seemed elitist and outdated.         A novelist and critic, Richard Plant, who reviewed ''A Legacy'' for The New York Times Book Review in 1957, said, ''If there existed an annual award for snobbery, this year's prize, in this reviewer's opinion, should go to Sybille Bedford.''         Her nonfiction work was more widely acclaimed. She covered more than 100 trials for publications s like Life, Esquire, The Observer and The Saturday Evening Post, and reported on the obscenity trial involving the British publication of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' the trial of Jack L. Ruby and the Auschwitz trial at Frankfurt in 1963-64, among others.         Her book ''The Trial of Dr. Adams'' (Simon & Schuster, 1958), sometimes titled ''The Best We Can Do: The Trial of Dr. Adams,'' retold one of England's most famous court cases: Dr. John Bodkin Adams, whose patients included rich, older women who often left him in their wills, was accused of murdering an elderly patient and was ultimately acquitted.         She published a two-part biography of her longtime friend, Aldous Huxley, in 1973. Ms. Bedford's last novel, ''Jigsaw: An Unsentimental Education'' (Hamish Hamilton, 1989), was a finalist for the Booker Prize. Her final book, ''Quicksands: A Memoir,'' was published last year.         In 1963 she was named a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The group elected her a Companion of Literature in 1994, a position held by only 10 writers at a time.         Sybille von Schoenebeck was born in Charlottenburg, Germany, in 1911. Her mother and father were separated, and after her father died, when she was 10, she lived with her mother in Italy. She was sent to England for an education she said never took place, and was largely self-educated. She considered England her home, and through a brief marriage to Walter Bedford in the 1930's, she officially became a British citizen. She was also a serious wine expert, traveling to France often for wine tastings. Throughout her life she lived around the world, including Italy, France, Portugal and the United States, before settling for good in London. She leaves no survivors.       
         Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died yesterday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.         With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- ''The Feminine Mystique'' is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W. W. Norton & Company, the book had sold more than three million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many languages.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' made Ms. Friedan world famous. It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960's and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president. In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro-Choice America. With Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug and others, she founded the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971.         Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Ms. Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.         For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Ms. Friedan, with her short stature and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a ''combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis,'' as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.         A brilliant student who graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Ms. Friedan trained as a psychologist but never pursued a career in the field. When she wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.         Though Ms. Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago:         ''Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today,'' Ms. Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface. ''I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily, and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home.''         The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Ms. Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.         Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Ms. Friedan charted a gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career-minded New Woman of the 1920's and 30's into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.         The portrait she painted was chilling. For a typical woman of the 1950's, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children. She cooked and baked and bandaged and chauffeured and laundered and sewed. She did the mopping and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit to the cleaners. She was happy to keep his dinner warm till he came wearily home from downtown.         The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the mass media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream. Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy. Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide. She consulted a spate of doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling and bridge. If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to get her through her busy day.         A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Ms. Friedan interviewed told her:         ''A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy. I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year. By noon I'm ready for a padded cell. Very little of what I've done has been really necessary or important. Outside pressures lash me though the day. Yet I look upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewives in the neighborhood.''         ''The Feminine Mystique'' began as a survey Ms. Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith. It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers. Judging from her own capable life, Ms. Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted. But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling -- a ''nameless, aching dissatisfaction'' that she would famously call ''the problem that has no name.''         When Ms. Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliffe and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same. The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book. They also forced her to confront the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.         Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill. Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who parlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry store. Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children. Only years later, when she was writing ''The Feminine Mystique,'' did Ms. Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.         Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized. She was barred from the fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked on dates. It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.         At Smith, she blossomed. For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things. Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 -- by that timeshe had dropped the final ''e,'' which she considered an affectation of her mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.         At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among others. She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for a doctorate. But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened by her success. He pressured her to turn down the fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount frequently in interviews. She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.         There, Ms. Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide. In 1946, she took a job as a reporter with U. E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America.         In 1947, she married Carl Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive. They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorian house in suburban Rockland County, N.Y.         Ms. Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.; Emily Friedan of Buffalo; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia; a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; and nine grandchildren.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike. The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory. Some critics also felt that Ms. Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, ''The Second Sex,'' dealt with many of the same issues.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called ''The Feminine Mystique'' a ''highly readable, provocative book,'' but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Ms. Friedan:         ''Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues. It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does. What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves.' ''         Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Ms. Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives. After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an N.A.A.C.P. for women.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women. She was its president until 1970.         One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike for Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New York and in cities around the country. In New York, tens of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Ms. Friedan in the lead. (Before the march, she made a point of lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open to men only.)         Carrying signs and banners (''Don't Cook Dinner -- Starve a Rat Tonight!'' ''Don't Iron While the Strike Is Hot''), women of all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched joyfully down the street to cheering crowds. The march ended with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, with passionate speeches by Ms. Friedan, Ms. Steinem, Ms. Abzug and Kate Millett.         Not all of Ms. Friedan's ventures were as successful. The First Women's Bank and Trust Company, which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business. Nor were even her indomitable presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.         Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Ms. Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by members of the women's movement. She was famously abrasive. She could be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament.         In the 1970's and afterward, some feminists criticized Ms. Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women and ignoring those of minorities, lesbians and the poor. Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.         Ms. Friedan's private life was also famously stormy. In her recent memoir, ''Life So Far'' (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.         Mr. Friedan, who died in December, repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Ms. Friedan's account a ''complete fabrication.'' He added: ''I am the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a reckless driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender.''         Ms. Friedan's other books include ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement'' (Random House, 1976); ''The Second Stage'' (Summit, 1981); and ''The Fountain of Age'' (Simon & Schuster, 1993).         The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia, Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years, Ms. Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.         Despite all of her later achievements, Ms. Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with ''The Feminine Mystique.'' Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.         The new society Ms. Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.         ''Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,' '' she told Life magazine in 1963. ''It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams. It is Chapel Hill, N.C., not New York City.

The new society Ms. Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.         ''Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,' '' she told Life magazine in 1963. ''It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         'The Problem That Has No Name'         Following is an excerpt from ''The Feminine Mystique,'' by Betty Friedan.         The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question -- ''Is this all?''         For over fifteen years there was no word of this yearning in the millions of words written about women, for women, in all the columns, books and articles by experts telling women their role was to seek fulfillment as wives and mothers. Over and over women heard in voices of tradition and of Freudian sophistication that they could desire no greater destiny than to glory in their own femininity. Experts told them how to catch a man and keep him, how to breastfeed children and handle their toilet training, how to cope with sibling rivalry and adolescent rebellion; how to buy a dishwasher, bake bread, cook gourmet snails, and build a swimming pool with their own hands; how to dress, look, and act more feminineand make marriage more exciting; how to keep their husbands from dying young and their sons from growing into delinquents.         In the fifteen years after World War II, this mystique of feminine fulfillment became the cherished and self-perpetuating core of contemporary American culture. Millions of women lived their lives in the image of those pretty pictures of the American suburban housewife, kissing their husbands goodbye in front of the picture window, depositing their stationwagonsful of children at school, and smiling as they ran the new electric waxer over the spotless kitchen floor. They baked their own bread, sewed their own and their children's clothes, kept their new washing machines and dryers running all day. They changed the sheets on the beds twice a week instead of once, took the rug-hooking class in adult education, and pitied their poor frustrated mothers, who had dreamed of having a career. Their only dream was to be perfect wives and mothers; their highest ambition to have five children and a beautiful house, their only fight to get and keep their husbands. They had no thought for the unfeminine problems of the world outside the home; they wanted the men to make the major decisions. They gloried in their role as women, and wrote proudly on the census blank: ''Occupation: housewife.''         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams. It is Chapel Hill, N.C., not New York City.       
         Octavia E. Butler, an internationally acclaimed science fiction writer whose evocative, often troubling, novels explore far-reaching issues of race, sex, power and, ultimately, what it means to be human, died on Friday after a fall near her home in Lake Forest Park, Wash. She was 58.         The precise cause of death has not been determined, Ms. Butler's literary agent, Merrilee Heifetz, said on Monday. She added that Ms. Butler had suffered from severe hypertension and other health problems in recent years.         In 1995 Ms. Butler was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, the first science fiction writer to be so honored. She received two Hugo Awards from the World Science Fiction Society and two Nebula Awards from the Science Fiction Writers of America.         Throughout Ms. Butler's career, the news media made much of the fact that she was an African-American woman writing science fiction, traditionally a white male bastion. But in interviews and in her work itself she left no doubt that her background equipped her spectacularly well to portray life in hostile dystopias where the odds of survival can be almost insurmountable.         ''I'm black, I'm solitary, I've always been an outsider,'' The Los Angeles Times quoted Ms. Butler as saying in 1998. She leaves no immediate survivors.         Set in time periods ranging from the historical past to the distant future, Ms. Butler's books were known for their controlled economy of language and for their strong, believable protagonists, many of them black women. She wrote a dozen novels, including ''Parable of the Sower'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1993); ''Parable of the Talents'' (Seven Stories Press, 1998); and, most recently, ''Fledgling'' (Seven Stories), which appeared last year.         Ms. Butler also published a story collection, ''Bloodchild'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1995).         Concerned with empathy and with the need to build community, Ms. Butler's work attracted an audience beyond its genre and was widely praised by critics. Translated into 10 languages, her books have sold more than a million copies altogether, Ms. Heifetz said.         One of Ms. Butler's best-known novels, ''Kindred'' (Doubleday, 1979), told the story of a modern-day black woman who must travel back to the antebellum South to save the life of a white, slaveholding ancestor and, in so doing, save her own. Frequently assigned in black-studies courses, the book was rooted in the experience of the author's mother, who worked as a maid.         ''I didn't like seeing her go through back doors,'' Ms. Butler once told Publishers Weekly. ''If my mother hadn't put up with all those humiliations, I wouldn't have eaten very well or lived very comfortably. So I wanted to write a novel that would make others feel the history: the pain and fear that black people have had to live through in order to endure.''         Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, Calif. As a girl, she was known as Junie. (This may have derived from ''Junior'': her mother was also named Octavia.) Her father, a shoeshine man, died when she was very young, and her mother reared her alone.         Always conspicuously tall for her age, Junie grew up paralytically shy, losing herself in books despite having dyslexia. Octavia Senior could not afford books, but she brought home the tattered discards of the white families for whom she worked.         Octavia Junior began writing stories as a child and soon turned to science fiction, attracted by a genre whose limitless possibilities let her imagine absolutely anything.         ''When I began writing science fiction, when I began reading, heck, I wasn't in any of this stuff I read,'' Ms. Butler told The New York Times in 2000. ''The only black people you found were occasional characters or characters who were so feeble-witted that they couldn't manage anything, anyway. I wrote myself in, since I'm me and I'm here and I'm writing.''         Ms. Butler earned an associate's degree from Pasadena City College in 1968, and later studied at California State University, Los Angeles.         As a student, Ms. Butler became a prot√©g√©e of the renowned science fiction writer Harlan Ellison. Over the next half-dozen years, living alone in a modest Los Angeles apartment, she rose each day at 2 a.m. to write. She supported herself through a series of dystopian jobs: dishwasher, telemarketer, potato chips inspector.         Her first novel, ''Patternmaster,'' was published by Doubleday in 1976. The book centers on a rigidly stratified society ruled by telepathic people called Patternists. It became the first installment in Ms. Butler's highly regarded Patternist series, whose later titles, most from Doubleday, include ''Mind of My Mind'' (1977); ''Survivor'' (1978); ''Wild Seed'' (1980); and ''Clay's Ark'' (St. Martin's, 1984).         Among Ms. Butler's other books are the Xenogenesis trilogy, published by Warner Books and comprising ''Dawn'' (1987), ''Adulthood Rites'' (1988) and ''Imago'' (1989). Her other awards include a lifetime achievement award from PEN Center West and the Langston Hughes Medal from the City College of New York.         In an interview with The New York Times in 2000, Ms. Butler explained the deep appropriateness of her chosen genre as a vehicle for social commentary.         ''We are a naturally hierarchical species,'' she said. ''When I say these things in my novels, sure I make up the aliens and all of that, but I don't make up the essential human character.''       
         Sarah Caldwell, one of America's best known and most adventurous conductors and opera directors and the founding director of the Opera Company of Boston, died Thursday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. She was 82.         She died of heart failure, said James Morgan, a former manager of the Boston company and a close associate.         Ms. Caldwell, who was also the first woman to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera, lived in Freeport, Me.         In 1990, 32 years after its founding, facing debt and disarray, the Opera Company of Boston went out of business. But in its glory years, Ms. Caldwell's company was a model of bold, imaginative programming, offering musically insightful productions with distinguished casts.         ''Some of the most creative work that many of us artists have done has been with Sarah,'' Beverly Sills, the soprano and former chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera, said yesterday. ''Some of the most aggravating, as well. She had a million different ways to do one thing and was never satisfied until she had tried them all.''         Ms. Caldwell often took on difficult 20th-century operas that bigger companies shirked. Her productions included the American premieres of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace,'' Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' Roger Sessions's ''Montezuma,'' Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Taverner'' and Rodion Shchedrin's ''Dead Souls,'' as well as the world premieres of Gunther Schuller's ''Fisherman and His Wife'' and Robert Di Domenica's ''Balcony.''         Her company seldom presented more than four productions a season. But from the start, Ms. Caldwell attracted world-class artists, notably Ms. Sills and Dame Joan Sutherland. She was both director and conductor for most of her productions -- a double role that often imbued them with a strong vision. But her split duties just as often seemed to divide her attention, resulting in weakened execution onstage and in the orchestra pit.         Ms. Caldwell's longest period of success came in the 1970's, when the company was thriving and her visibility as a conductor was growing. In 1974, she became only the second woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic. (Nadia Boulanger had been the first in 1939 and again in 1962.) For the program, partly sponsored by Ms. magazine, Ms. Caldwell offered only works by women, among them Ruth Crawford Seeger, Lili Boulanger and Thea Musgrave.         A Time magazine cover story on Nov. 10, 1975, called her ''Music's Wonder Woman.'' Two months later, on Jan. 13, 1976, she became the first woman to conduct at the Met. The opera was ''La Traviata,'' starring Ms. Sills, who had cajoled the company into engaging Ms. Caldwell. She conducted 11 total performances.         As a company director, Ms. Caldwell was notoriously disorganized and loath to delegate authority. Only 5 feet 3 inches tall and, for most of her life, overweight, she was an indomitable but chaotic force. Rehearsal periods were typically fraught with crisis. Ms. Caldwell, sleepless and disheveled, would keep stage crews working all night and fight off creditors all day. Stories abounded of staff members' finding their boss napping in a stairwell or atop a pile of costumes backstage.         Yet, even on a shoestring budget, she managed to present challenging repertory in inventive productions. One, in 1965, was Rossini's ''Semiramide,'' a rarely performed work at the time, with Dame Joan and Marilyn Horne. Ms. Caldwell also staged the United States premiere of ''Boris Godunov'' with Mussorgsky's original orchestration nine years before the Metropolitan Opera did. And hers was the first complete American staging of Berlioz's ''Troyens.''         Ms. Caldwell faced formidable obstacles in running her company. Financial support from the Boston civic and cultural worlds was inconsistent, and the company lacked an adequate theater. The year her company began, 1958, the long-neglected 50-year-old Boston Opera House was torn down, and the new company was forced into a nomadic existence, performing at the Donnelly Theater (razed in 1968), then the downtown Shubert Theater and then a series of unlikely places, like a university gym and a South End cyclorama.         The company finally settled at the Orpheum Theater, staying for five years. But the stage was only 26 feet deep, and there was no orchestra pit. Ms. Caldwell's solution was to remove several rows of seats from the orchestra section to make room for her players. She conducted sitting in a director's chair, usually in slippers.         In 1978, the company bought the B. F. Keith Memorial Theater on Washington Street in downtown Boston, and it finally had a home -- a run-down but potentially excellent 2,500-seat theater with good acoustics and palatial lobbies. But the stage was just 35 feet deep, and the only way to expand would have been to claim a small street that bordered the back of the building, an idea that neighborhood residents and businesses opposed. A complete renovation would have cost only $13 million, Ms. Caldwell estimated. But by 1990, with back taxes looming, she sold the theater to a Texas developer, and her company essentially ceased to exist.         Sarah Caldwell was born on March 6, 1924, in Maryville, Mo. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. During her childhood, she and her brother frequently lived with relatives while her mother, Margaret, was off pursuing graduate studies in music. Ms. Caldwell began taking violin lessons early, and by 6 was giving concerts out of state. When her mother married Henry Alexander, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, the family moved to Fayetteville.         Discouraged by her stepfather from pursuing a career in music, Ms. Caldwell entered the University of Arkansas as a psychology major. Within a year she was a violin major at Hendrix College in Arkansas. She later earned a scholarship from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.         It was her summers in the Berkshires at the Tanglewood Music Institute that shifted her toward opera. There, in 1947, she staged Vaughan Williams's ''Riders to the Sea.'' Her idol, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, who directed the institute, was so impressed, he invited her to join the faculty the next year. During this period she became an assistant to the conductor Boris Goldovsky, who ran an opera program at the New England Conservatory. By 1952, Ms. Caldwell was running one herself, at Boston University, which she kept going for eight years.         She started her own company, initially called the Opera Group, in 1958 with just $5,000 in seed money. By 1965, renamed the Opera Company of Boston, it had won an important place in American opera. She tried to be everything: administrator, fund-raiser, proselytizer. But her assumption of both the director and conductor roles in her productions cost the company time and money. During rehearsals, the orchestra would often sit idly in the pit, collecting union-scale pay, while Ms. Caldwell dealt with a directorial detail onstage.         When everything came together, however, the productions had the kind of cohesiveness usually achievable only in festival conditions. There was, for example, a critically hailed production of Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini'' in 1975 with Jon Vickers in the title role; another vibrant production was of Verdi's ''Macbeth'' with Shirley Verrett, a frequent Caldwell collaborator who became Boston's favorite diva, as Lady Macbeth.         Ms. Caldwell was generally thought to be more gifted as a director. Her ideas were usually backed by enormous amounts of historical research. But her conducting, while technically idiosyncratic and often untidy, was musical and sensitive. And she was a pioneer of colorblind casting in opera.         Ms. Caldwell's constant search for financial support led her into a political quagmire in 1982. She agreed to develop an opera program in the Philippines, signing a contract with Imelda Marcos, the wife of the country's repressive president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. Ms. Caldwell insisted that the contract was with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, not the government. But in reality Mrs. Marcos was financing the center to help build her political power base. A year later, facing protests at home from human-rights groups and outraged company patrons, Ms. Caldwell pulled out of the deal.         In 1988, she organized an ambitious three-week festival called Making Music Together, which took 250 Soviet dancers, musicians, composers and other artists to Boston for some 80 events. The festival was budgeted at $2.4 million. But when corporate support and ticket sales did not meet expectations, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, with the intervention of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, bailed Ms. Caldwell out with more state support, averting a diplomatic embarrassment.         For many years Ms. Caldwell lived with her mother in Weston, a Boston suburb. She leaves no immediate survivors.         In 1999, Ms. Caldwell accepted a post as distinguished professor of music at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, but left within several years because of poor health. Missing New England, she moved to Freeport in 2003.         Ms. Caldwell never gave up hope that she could raise funds and re-start her company. It was not to be. But for a while, as the British critic Andrew Porter wrote in The New Yorker, she was ''the single best thing about opera in America.''       
         Cindy Walker, a country songwriter whose pure, plainspoken lyrics of romance, heartbreak and picturesque prairies were recorded by major artists like Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson, making Top-40 country or pop charts more than 400 times, died on March 23 in Mexia, Tex.         She was 87, but did not broadcast her birthdate any more than the brief marriage she sometimes confirmed and sometimes did not. Her niece Carol Adams reported her death, The Associated Press said.         Until the 1990's, it was easier to count the number of country stars who had not recorded Cindy Walker songs than those who had, Texas Monthly observed in 1999. She had Top 10 hits in every decade from the 1940's to the 1980's.         Even as country music veered in louder, brasher directions, her continuing appeal to traditionalists is suggested by Mr. Nelson's release this year of an album of her songs, ''You Don't Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker.''         The title song was a hit for Eddy Arnold in 1956, Ray Charles in 1962 and Mickey Gilley in 1981, and was re-recorded by Mr. Charles with Diana Krall for his best-selling 2004 album of duets, ''Genius Loves Company.'' Presley, Van Morrison, Patti Page, Roy Orbison, Kenny Rogers and Emmylou Harris are among others who have recorded the tune.         It told of a man too shy to tell his true feelings to a female friend:         You give your hand to me         And then you say hello         And I can hardly speak         My heart is beating so         And anyone could tell         You think you know me well,         But you don't know me.         Writing on a floral-patterned typewriter, she produced a string of other sentimental standards like ''Cherokee Maiden,'' ''In the Misty Moonlight,'' ''Dream Baby,'' ''Jim, I Wore a Tie Today'' and ''Distant Drums.'' Gene Autry and other singing cowboys crooned her lyrics onscreen, and Bob Wills, patron saint of western swing, recorded more than 50 of her tunes, some of which he helped write.         Her songs have many times crossed over to pop to be recorded by Bette Midler, the Byrds, Cher and Michael Bolton, among other stars.         Harlan Howard, himself often called the greatest country songwriter, deferred to Ms. Walker when both were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997. He called her ''the greatest living songwriter of country music.''         Fred Foster, Mr. Orbison's producer and the discoverer of Dolly Parton, the only woman songwriter whose output rivals Ms. Walker's, said in an interview with The Austin American-Statesman in 2004, ''Cindy Walker has never written a bad song in her life.''         Howard once called a great country song ''three chords and the truth,'' and Ms. Walker's life sounds as if it springs from that formula. A granddaughter of the hymn writer F. L. Eiland (''Hold to God's Unchanging Hand''), she was born on July 20, 1918, on a farm near Mart, Tex. By age 12, she was composing songs on her Martin guitar.         On a family trip to Hollywood in 1940, she barged into Bing Crosby's studio and sold him a song, ''Lone Star Trail,'' which he recorded. Within weeks, she had her own record deal, with Decca.         From 1942 to 1944, she wrote 39 songs for Wills's western movies; was a movie actress herself; and, in 1944, wrote her first Top-10 country hit, ''You're From Texas,'' which Wills performed. She also recorded a hit herself in 1944, ''When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again,'' a song she did not write.         In 1954, she moved to Mexia, near her East Texas birthplace. There she lived in a modest three-bedroom house with her mother, Oree, and rose at dawn, made herself black coffee and went upstairs to write.         She was as proficient at pushing songs as writing them. Each year for decades, she and her mother would set up shop in an apartment in Nashville for five months or so to market songs. They would sweeten deals by inviting music industry people by for a plate or two of her mother's delectable Southern cooking.         Oree Walker was her best friend and, until her death, in 1991, worked out melodies for her daughter's words. Some suggested that Ms. Walker's declining output in later years was a result of Oree's absence.         Ms. Walker guarded her privacy. When she granted interviews, she stipulated that her age not be given. She worried that she might be regarded as too old to write contemporary songs.         Many articles about her, often based on interviews, say she never married. In an interview with The New York Times this year, however, she said she had had a ''short-lived marriage'' but declined to discuss it. She is survived by three nieces.         Ms. Walker did not consider herself a feminist pioneer; she often said that the music industry would welcome a potential hit written by anyone, even an orangutan. She declined to hang her awards on the wall. She kept them under her bed.         ''Worldly things were of little meaning,'' her niece Ms. Adams told The Associated Press. ''She lived for hamburgers, ice cream, pencil and paper.''       
         Anna Marly, who wrote the melody to the song that became the anthem of the French Resistance in World War II and whose whistling and singing on the radio were an inspiration to the anti-Nazi underground, died on Feb. 15 in her home in Palmer, Alaska. She was 88.         Her death was confirmed by Kristin Boyd, an employee of Evergreen Memorial Chapel in Anchorage. Several published reports said the cause was cancer.         Miss Marly, who in her later years used her married name, Smiernow, wrote the melody to ''Chant des Partisans,'' or ''Song of the Partisans,'' which became an unofficial French anthem in the last years of World War II.         On the British Broadcasting Corporation's French Service, she sang that song and others, including the ballad ''La Complainte du Partisan,'' known as ''The Partisan'' in its English rendition.         Gen. Charles de Gaulle called Miss Marly the ''troubadour of the Resistance.''         In the United States, ''The Partisan'' gained popularity when Leonard Cohen recorded it in 1969, and Joan Baez did in 1972. Many French singers have recorded ''Chant des Partisans,'' including Yves Montand in 1955.         Miss Marly wrote more than 300 songs, most with lyrics, one of which, ''Une Chanson √† Trois Temps,'' was recorded by √âdith Piaf.         On radio, Ms. Marly whistled the first notes of ''Chant des Partisans'' to signal the twice-daily broadcasts of the program ''Honor and Homeland.'' Her crisp, clear whistling pierced the static caused by Nazi jamming.         Anna Betoulinsky was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Oct. 30, 1917, into an aristocratic family. The Russian revolution was raging and her father was shot by a Bolshevik firing squad. She, her mother, sister and a nanny escaped to Finland.         They eventually found their way to Menton, on the French Riviera, where Russian √©migr√©s established an intellectual and artistic community that Vladimir Nabokov described in early novels.         There, the teenage Anna took music lessons from Prokofiev, danced in the Ballets Russes and won a Miss Russia contest, after which she went to Algeria to compete for Miss World. At 17, she joined the national society of composers.         Also at 17, she began her professional singing career at a celebrated Paris night spot called Sch√©h√©razade. She said in an interview with The Anchorage Daily News in 2004 that she wore ''a medieval dress,'' accompanied herself on a guitar and performed only original tunes.         Around that time, she rejected the name Betoulinsky as too unwieldy for a performer and chose the name Marly at random from a phone book. In 1938, she married a Dutch aristocrat whose name does not seem to be mentioned in articles about her in print and the Internet.         As the Nazis approached Paris in 1940, she and her husband fled through Spain and Portugal to London. They arrived in the midst of the blitz in February 1941, and she joined a volunteer corps that collected people's scattered remains for identification and burial. She also performed songs in French, English, Russian and Polish for Allied forces, and became a volunteer tea lady for leaders of the French Resistance.         Miss Marly got the idea for the resistance anthem when she read a newspaper report about Russian partisans fighting the Nazis at Smolensk. The Independent, a London newspaper, reported that the song's structure was inspired by the Russian word for partisan, ''partinski,'' which she used rhythmically to create a somber elegy.         The Independent said the song, which she first called ''The March of the Partisans,'' had unusual metrical form -- lines of 11 syllables with a three-syllable ''cadence'' at the end of each verse.         It was translated from Russian to English by Louba Krassine and quickly came to be called the ''Guerrilla Song.'' When it was heard by the French novelists Joseph Kessel and Maurice Druon, they immediately decided to translate it into French for radio broadcasts to the French Resistance.         Miss Marly later complained that they kept almost none of her original lyrics except for the word ''crows,'' which she used as a haunting metaphor for Nazi planes.         Emmanuel d'Astair de la Vigerie, a leader of the French Resistance, code-named Bernard, heard the song with the two novelists and urged that a French version be prepared. Bernard later wrote the lyrics for the song that came to be known as ''The Partisan'' in English. The lyrics were loosely translated into English by the American songwriter Hy Zaret.         Miss Marly's marriage ended in divorce. She met George Smiernow, a metallurgist, while touring in South America. They married in 1946, lived for four years in Paris, then moved to the United States in 1959, where they lived in Pennsylvania, Florida and New York.         Mr. Smiernow died in 2000, and Mrs. Smiernow moved to Alaska in 2003. She left no immediate survivors.         For years, she was regaled with stories of how ''Le Chant des Partisans'' had heartened resistance fighters. One former fighter came up after a performance to tell her that he and four others were captured by Germans and told to dig their own graves.         As they dug, ''to give us spirit, we were whistling your song,'' said the man, the only one of the five to survive.         Correction:  March 16, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Anna Marly, who wrote the melody for the anthem of the French Resistance in World War II, misstated the Russian word for partisan, which she used as a rhythmic accent. It is partizan, not partinski. The obituary also misspelled the surname of the Resistance leader who urged the preparation of a French version of the song. He was Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, not d'Astair.       
         Maureen Stapleton, who created a gallery of pugnacious, sometimes profane but always vulnerable heroines on Broadway, in films and on television and who won an Academy Award for her fiery performance as the anarchist Emma Goldman in ''Reds,'' died yesterday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was chronic pulmonary disease, said her son, Daniel Allentuck.         Ms. Stapleton had one of the most honored acting careers of her generation. Her Academy Award for ''Reds,'' Warren Beatty's 1981 epic about the Russian Revolution, came on her fourth Oscar nomination. She also won two Tony Awards and an Emmy among many nominations.         Ms. Stapleton's story embodied the classic theatrical clich√©. A small-town girl nurtured on long afternoons at the movies, she came to New York in 1943 with dreams of becoming a star in the theater. She worked at a variety of jobs -- salesgirl, hotel clerk, artists' model -- while attending acting school. Then, not long after her theatrical baptism in summer stock and a few small roles on Broadway, fortune smiled.         It was 1950. Tennessee Williams had written a play called ''The Rose Tattoo,'' and he wanted the renowned Italian actress Anna Magnani to play the lead role, that of Serafina Delle Rose, an earthy Sicilian-American widow looking for love. But Magnani declined, fearing that her English was inadequate for Broadway. Other actresses were auditioned, without success. Harold Clurman, who had directed Ms. Stapleton earlier that year in Arthur Laurents's ''Bird Cage,'' suggested that the producers audition her. After repeated callbacks, she was told she had the part.         A friend from acting school, Eli Wallach, was cast opposite her as Alvaro Mangiacavallo, the simple but loving truck driver who revives the widow's spirits in a tumultuous courtship.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' opened at the Martin Beck Theater in February 1951. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times, called the performance ''triumphant'' and praised her ability to convey not only the coarseness of the plainspoken Serafina but also her moments of exaltation. The play ran for 300 performances then toured for six months.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' fulfilled Ms. Stapleton's childhood dream of becoming a star and also earned her a Tony Award. But the stress of her first major role also introduced the demons that would pursue her throughout her career. She began to drink, though she always maintained that she drank only after a performance. (She routinely vomited before curtain time.) She also became convinced that someday, someone in the audience was going to kill her.         Ms. Stapleton's growing paranoia led her to seek out a psychotherapist after the show ended its tour, but a cure for her ills -- she also had a lifelong fear of elevators and airplanes -- proved elusive. One therapist was to treat her for 14 years.         Despite her problems with alcohol and bouts of anxiety, her life seemed to be on a positive track. She married Max Allentuck, general manager for the producer Kermit Bloomgarden. They had a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Katherine. When word came that Williams was ready with a new play, ''Orpheus Descending,'' she was told once again that he wanted Magnani to play the heroine, a frustrated Italian-American storekeeper in a small Southern town whose world is torn apart by the arrival of a handsome newcomer. Magnani declined again, and the role went to Ms. Stapleton.         The play opened on Broadway in March 1957 and drew mixed reviews, but Ms. Stapleton won raves in the lead role of Lady Torrance, Williams's gritty, sex-starved heroine. Cliff Robertson played Val Xavier, the handsome interloper.         The following year she had audiences laughing in the S. N. Behrman comedy ''The Cold Wind and the Warm,'' in which she played a freewheeling matchmaker. She also received her first Emmy nomination for her work in a television adaptation of ''All the King's Men.'' Then Hollywood beckoned, and in her very first film, an adaptation of Nathaniel West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts'' (1959), she was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress, playing a deceitful man-eater.         In 1959 she and Mr. Allentuck were divorced, and she began a relationship with the playwright David Rayfiel, whom she eventually married. But guilt and anxiety over her divorce, she said, drove her further into alcoholism and indulgence. Her weight ballooned. Liquor was a fixture in her dressing room. ''The curtain came down and I went into the vodka,'' she told an interviewer. She later said that in many ways she had been reliving a painful childhood.         Lois Maureen Stapleton was born on June 21, 1925, in Troy, N.Y. She remembered her father, John, as ''a prodigious drinker'' who had endless battles with her mother, Irene, until they separated when Maureen was a child. She was an unhappy, overweight girl who spent hours at the movies, where, she said, she would ''dream myself right onto the screen.'' She fantasized about someday becoming a Jean Harlow or a Barbara Stanwyck.         When she was old enough to work, her goal was to save $100 to move to New York City and become an actress; in 1943, she left Troy for Manhattan, where she and a friend shared a $45-a-month apartment.         ''I was 17 years old, I weighed 180 pounds and I had a hundred bucks in my pocket,'' she recalled. ''I was invincible.''         She enrolled at the New School, where she studied acting with Herbert Berghof, and in 1947 joined the Actors Studio. But she eventually grew impatient with some of the excesses of Lee Strasberg's Method approach to acting. Even so, she remembered the Studio as ''a special working place.'' Her colleagues included Montgomery Clift, Julie Harris, Marlon Brando, Anne Jackson and Mr. Wallach, and her apartment became an actors' hangout. It was among the happiest times of her life.         Once established on Broadway and in films and television, she was rarely idle. She appeared on Broadway with Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's ''Toys in the Attic'' in 1960 and in the film version of ''Orpheus,'' retitled ''The Fugitive Kind.'' Williams got his wish, though, and Anna Magnani played Lady Torrance onscreen while Ms. Stapleton settled for a lesser role. Ms. Stapleton had an earlier disappointment when Magnani won an Academy Award for best actress as Serafina in the 1955 film version of ''The Rose Tattoo.''         By this time, she was married again, to Mr. Rayfiel, but her drinking was out of control. She was hospitalized for detoxification, after which she voluntarily entered a psychiatric facility. Her second marriage lasted three years. A few months after her divorce, she returned to the role that had made her a star, appearing as Serafina opposite Harry Guardino in a revival of ''The Rose Tattoo'' at the City Center.         In 1967 she won an Emmy for her television work in ''Among the Paths to Eden,'' an adaptation of a Truman Capote story about a spinster and a widower. (When an interviewer asked her if she minded being regularly cast as an older woman -- something that began early in her career -- she merely shrugged and said, ''I was born old.'')         A year later she was cast opposite George C. Scott in Neil Simon's comedy ''Plaza Suite,'' staged by Mike Nichols. She and Mr. Scott played three different warring couples to hilarious effect, and her performance won her another Tony nomination.         The awards and nominations kept coming. She was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for ''Airport'' (1970); she won a best-actress Tony that same year for her portrayal of an alcoholic down-and-out singer in Mr. Simon's laughing-through-tears drama ''The Gingerbread Lady''; she and her co-star, Charles Durning, received Emmy nominations for ''Queen of the Stardust Ballroom'' (1975), playing a couple who warm to romance when they meet at a dance hall.         Another Oscar nomination, for supporting actress, followed her work in Woody Allen's 1978 drama, ''Interiors.'' In 1981, she was nominated for a Tony for ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the battered Aunt Birdie opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role, Regina. In his review in The Times, Frank Rich called her ''a wonder'' and added, ''such is this actress's talent that she can conjure abject terror out of silence and thin air.'' It turned out to be her last appearance on Broadway.         But her movie career continued, perhaps most memorably as the revolutionary Goldman in ''Reds.'' The performance won her the Oscar for best supporting actress. Her film credits also included ''Cocoon'' (1985) and its sequel, as one of a group of Florida retirees rejuvenated by extraterrestrials, and ''Nuts'' (1987), in which she played the mother of a high-priced call girl (Barbra Streisand).         When her grandchildren were born, Ms. Stapleton moved to Lenox to be near family, namely her daughter, Katharine Allentuck Bambery, her grandson Max and her granddaughter Alexandra, all of whom survive her, along with her son, Daniel, of Manhattan, and a brother, John, of Troy. (She was not related to the actress Jean Stapleton, as many people have thought.)         In Lenox she doted on her grandchildren and continued to accept the occasional role, playing a woman dying of ovarian cancer in the television drama ''Last Wish'' (1992) and appearing opposite Armin Mueller-Stahl in the 1994 film ''The Last Good Time.''         She also wrote her autobiography, ''A Hell of a Life,'' with Jane Scovell in 1995, in which she looked back on a life in the theater with a few regrets but a lot of satisfaction. When the curtain went up or the camera rolled, she said, ''I did the best I could.''         But what she loved most, she wrote, was ''the challenge and the opportunity to leave reality behind and become someone else.''         Correction:  March 20, 2006, Monday  An obituary of the actress Maureen Stapleton on Tuesday misspelled the given name of the author of the novel that inspired her first film, ''Miss Lonelyhearts.'' He was Nathanael West, not Nathaniel.       
         Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89.         She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.         In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities.         At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.         Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.         ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.         Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.         In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.         ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''         Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''         Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''         The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.         Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.         Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.         ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.         ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said.         Action, Not Just Words         Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.         In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape.         The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won.         Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.         She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.         ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.         After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.         But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.         What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.         Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.         A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.         But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.         On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.         In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.         In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.         Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.         In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.         ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''         Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.         ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''         Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.         Subways Lead to Jobs         Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.         She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.         She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.         While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.         Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.         Suspicions Aroused         In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.         ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.         ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''         Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.         ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''         William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.         ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''         The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.         Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''         ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''         Form Over Substance?         Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.         ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.         Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.         She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.         Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.         During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.         She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.         In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.         ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''       
         Helen Hobbs Jordan, an exacting and tart-tongued music teacher who instructed generations of performers in ear training and theory, including Melissa Manchester, Bette Midler and Tony Bennett, died on Wednesday at her suite in the Salisbury Hotel, near Carnegie Hall. She was 99.         Mrs. Jordan left no immediate survivors, said Mary Jo Kaplan, a friend and former student, but her family was huge: a legion of devoted former pupils who tended to her needs.         One volunteered as her doctor, another as her accountant, another as her money manager. Others brought groceries and took her to dinner. Early last year, as Mrs. Jordan's money began running out, the group put on a benefit concert that raised more than $40,000, including large checks from Ms. Midler and Mr. Bennett.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Jordan taught sight singing, score reading and other fundamentals. But she also drummed in different sorts of lessons, like the importance of decorum, honesty and the pursuit of perfection.         ''I don't tolerate errors,'' an elegantly dressed Mrs. Jordan said in an interview with The New York Times in January 2005. ''If you have a brain, for God's sake, use it.''         Her students included the guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli and Gene Bertoncini; the singers Lesley Gore and Paul Simon; and the actor and director Carl Reiner. Future stars and those who were already stars came to her to polish the basics.         Melissa Manchester said she studied sight singing with Mrs. Jordan in the early 1970's.         ''I was just so impressed by her strength and character and her desire for excellence,'' Ms. Manchester said. ''That's what she wanted for her students. I was sort of sloppy around the edges regarding my musicianship. But she kept me humble and clear-sighted in terms of really not compromising.''         Mrs. Jordan carved out a niche among jingle singers, teaching them how to walk into a studio and immediately master a singing line, without rehearsal, during expensive recording sessions.         ''She taught the top,'' said Ms. Kaplan, a producer at Showtime.         For years Mrs. Jordan conducted classes at Steinway Hall in Manhattan. She self-published more than a dozen books laying out her method.         Helen Hobbs was born in Topeka, Kan., on April 6, 1907. Her father, Charles Hobbs, was later elected Kansas insurance commissioner, and her mother, Emma Swisher, taught piano. She received her undergraduate degree in music from Washburn University in Topeka.         In the 1930's she moved to New York City to continue a career as a violinist, attending the Juilliard School and Teachers College at Columbia. At one point she gave concerts on long train trips, and she toured Europe before World War II.         She grew frustrated with the violin and spontaneously gave it away to a cab driver whose instrument had been stolen. She went on to lead the general musicianship department of the American Theater Wing's professional school.         Mrs. Jordan was briefly married to Robert Jordan, a lawyer, before they divorced in the early 1950's. She had a long relationship with David Collyer, a Broadway singer and teacher, who died in 1996, and to the end kept a publicity photograph of him in her sitting room. She was godmother to his daughter, Ingrid Saxon, and they remained close.         ''She just didn't want to play second fiddle to anybody,'' Ms. Manchester said. ''She just wanted to star in her own life, and I think she did.''       
         Kathleen Powers Pflueger, owner of one of the world's great collections of 18th-century porcelain and 16th- and 17-century faience, a form of earthenware, died on March 30 surrounded by her pieces in the Park Avenue apartment that she had designed to house them. She was 90.         Her death was confirmed by her nephew Donald H. Dewey.         Mrs. Pflueger, who was known as Kiyi (pronounced kai-yai), was born into a family that counted among its ancestors early settlers of Manhattan, Rhode Island and Martha's Vineyard.         She was drawn into the rarefied world of porcelain by her husband, Edward M. Pflueger, who had begun collecting it in the 1930's. They married in 1943. Mr. Pflueger had immigrated to the United States from Germany to establish an American base for Bayer A.G., the pharmaceutical company. He was chairman and president of the company in New York until 1975. Mrs. Pflueger became his partner in assembling collections of more than 700 pieces.         A turning point in their collaboration came in 1949, when they acquired the Otto Blohm porcelain collection, one of the finest in the world.         ''The Pfluegers collected for more than 40 years and formed an absolutely superb collection of French faience and German porcelain and faience,'' said Anne Little Poulet, director of the Frick Collection. She came to know the Pfluegers when she led the department of European decorative arts and sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.         Ms. Poulet, who traveled with the couple to shows and auctions, helped persuade them to donate 377 pieces to the Boston museum. Mr. Pflueger agreed to do so on his wife's death. He died in 1997 at the age of 91. The rest of the collection will remain with the family, Ms. Poulet said.         Tracey Albainy, senior curator of decorative arts and sculpture in the museum's European art department, declined to disclose the collection's estimated value.         The collection is particularly admired for the quality of its porcelains from the Japanese Palace in Dresden, Germany. In the early 1700's, the palace was a getaway for Augustus II, known as Augustus the Strong, who was King of Poland and an elector of Saxony and who built the palace specifically for his collection.         The Pfluegers also acquired an impressive number of porcelain figures modeled on commedia dell'arte, the Italian comic theater.         In 1993 Christie's auction house published two books showing the Pflueger collection.         Most of their acquisitions were housed in the spacious Park Avenue apartment that Mrs. Pflueger had designed for them.         But some went to their country home, Kiyiwana Farm, a 1,000-acre property in Dutchess County. The farm has five houses, stables and barns, and a red tea house, all largely designed by Mrs. Pflueger. Formal terraced gardens feature 18th- and 19th-century statuary.         In Manhattan, Mrs. Pflueger was a founder of the Winter Antiques Show, established in 1954 to aid the East Side House Settlement, on whose board she served from 1947 to 1991. Modeled on the Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair in London, it became, and remains, one of the premiere antiques shows in Manhattan. Mrs. Pflueger was also on the arts committee of the China Institute and helped design and establish a gallery there.         Mr. Dewey, her nephew, said that Mrs. Pflueger had been a firm believer in the importance of genealogy. Her father was descended from early New York settlers; her mother, from colonizers of Martha's Vineyard and Newport, R.I. One of her grandfathers became a parks commissioner in New York; another held a patent on the term ''tomatoketchup.''         She belonged to a raft of organizations with lofty pedigrees in American society, among them the Colonial Dames of America, the Order of the Crown of Charlemagne, the Hereditary Order of Descendants of Colonial Governors and the Order of Colonial Lords of Manors in America.         Kathleen Isabel Powers was born on Oct. 4, 1915, the fifth of eight children of Harry Lord Powers and Elizabeth Robinson Hazard at Shrewsbury Manor, their agricultural and equestrian estate in Shrewsbury, N.J. She lived there until she was a teenager, when she was sent to school in Paris. As a young woman, she worked as an interior designer. ''Like a lot of people in the Depression,'' Mr. Dewey said, ''she was left with all the trappings, but not much money.''         She is survived by a sister, Patricia Hazard Powers Frech, of Manhattan.       
         Muriel Spark, known for her finely polished, darkly comic prose and for the unforgettable Miss Jean Brodie, one of the funniest and most sinister characters in modern fiction, died Friday at a hospital in Florence, Italy. She was 88.         Ms. Spark's death was announced yesterday, The Associated Press reported, by Massimiliano Dindalini, the mayor of the Tuscan village of Civitella della Chiana, where she had lived for almost 30 years.         Her work, unlocked from her innermost memories of her experiences before and after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954, built a canon of short, sometimes macabre, sometimes humorous novels that sought to pare away the absurdities of human behavior.         Ms. Spark's first novel was published when she was 39, and after that she supplied a stream of slender novels and enigmatic short stories peopled with such curiosities as narrators from beyond the grave, flying saucers, grandmotherly smugglers with bread bins full of diamond-studded loaves and individuals of so little substance that they disappear when the door closes.         In her writing, evil is never far away, violence is a regular visitor and death is a constant companion. Her themes were generally serious but nearly always handled with a feather-light touch.         It is this lightness, and a contrived detachment toward her characters, that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work, which at her death included more than 20 novels, several collections of short stories, poetry, criticism, biography, plays and a handful of children's books.         Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent -- sometimes quite merrily -- to terrible deaths.         ''People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone,'' she said in an interview in The New Yorker. ''I'm often very deadpan, but there's a moral statement too, and what it's saying is that there's a life beyond this, and these events are not the most important things. They're not important in the long run.''         She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1, 1918, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland, and his wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell, a Protestant from a country village near London.         When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie's High School for Girls, where she became one of the cr√®me de la cr√®me of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay, the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1961), which was later adapted for the stage and film.         Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief, and as she had put it, ''disastrous,'' marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa.         He was known as S. O. S., a fitting nickname, it turned out, when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years. ''He became a borderline case, and I didn't like what I found on either side of the border,'' she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, ''Curriculum Vitae.''         They lived in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and their union produced her only child, a son, Robin.         She kept the name Spark, partly for her son's sake and partly because she thought it had ''some ingredient of life and of fun.''         She longed to return to Britain, but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel. She finally succeeded in returning aboard a troopship in 1944, leaving her son, then 6, in the care of convent nuns in Central Africa until the war was over.         Once home, she went to London in search of work, taking up residence at the Helena Club, which later became the model for the May of Teck Club, the setting for her 1963 novel, ''The Girls of Slender Means.''         Propaganda and Poetry         In London she landed a job with the Foreign Office in a secret division that disseminated black propaganda, a brand of disinformation she described as ''detailed truth with believable lies.'' The reports, broadcast on what masqueraded as a German radio station, used real names and addresses to lend veracity to invented stories, and the announcers were German prisoners of war. Although the fabricated news items were aimed at undermining the Nazis, there were times when they worked too well and surfaced as news in the British press.         After the war she worked at a jewelry trade publication, Argentor, in London, joined the Poetry Society and later became editor of its Poetry Review, a job that lasted for two tempestuous years before she was dismissed. Her innovations there included paying for worthy submissions and ending the practice of accepting payments from poets, a change that drastically altered the content of the review and outraged its establishment.         She founded a short-lived literary magazine, then went to work for a publishing house, devoting the remainder of her time to writing poetry, doing book reviews and writing and editing scholarly works, including the letters of John Henry Cardinal Newman.         Ms. Spark said she discovered through the writings of Cardinal Newman that the foundations of the Roman Catholic church corresponded with her personal convictions. She described her conversion to Catholicism as a natural step in her life. ''There was no blinding revelation in my case,'' she wrote in her autobiography.         Her first novel, ''The Comforters'' (1957), was born of religion and delusions. Newly converted and living in London in 1954, during the period of postwar food rationing, Ms. Spark ate little and chased away her hunger with Dexedrine, a combination that led to a period of hallucinations. The words she had once manipulated turned on her, trapping her in a fog of anagrams and crosswords and convincing her that a code ran through the literature she read.         After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Ms. Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, ''took the edge off cold charity.''         In ''The Comforters,'' a young woman recovering from a breakdown finds that she is a character in a novel that is being written on a phantom typewriter that only she can hear.         Religion is present in Ms. Spark's work in a variety of guises, from the unseen and unforgiving hand in ''Memento Mori'' (1959) to the hypocrisy of self-righteously pious characters like the couple in the short story ''The Black Madonna.'' Later in her life, the issue of her religious heritage became a persistent irritant.         She traced the seeds of ''Memento Mori,'' her third novel, to her childhood, when she learned about old age and human frailty at close range, caring for her dying grandmother. Although the novel is steeped in death and deception it is at times unabashedly hilarious. In the book, one elderly person after another in a close circle gets a mysterious phone call with a simple message: ''Remember, you must die.'' This slim novel about confronting mortality, packed with sex, blackmail and mystery, was adapted for the stage.         While Ms. Spark's books cover a broad territory of plot and character, some central similarities can be found in many of the novels and short stories.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review of Ms. Spark's novel ''Reality and Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1997, described the author's approach as a recipe: ''Take a self-enclosed community (of writers, schoolgirls, nuns, rich people, etc.) that is full of incestuous liaisons and fraternal intrigue; toss in a bombshell (like murder, suicide or betrayal) that will ricochet dangerously around this little world; and add some allusions to the supernatural to ground these melodramatics in an old-fashioned context of good and evil. Serve up with crisp, authoritative prose and present with 'a light and heartless hand.' ''         Delving Into School Secrets         This recipe appears with variations in novels including ''The Ballad of Peckham Rye'' (1960) , in which a truly devilish young man who calls himself an industrial analyst insinuates himself into the life of a community and goes about creating suspicion among neighbors, delving into personal secrets and destroying lives.         It reappears in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which provides a memorable example of a small and controlled community -- a girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930's -- in which the imperious teacher molds lives in a way few educators can.         ''Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she will be mine for life,'' intones the elegant Miss Brodie, who does not care whether her charges know their history or arithmetic as long as they have an appreciation of the finer things: art, Mussolini, proper care of the complexion, Franco.         She captivates her students and enriches their lives while exerting unnatural control, grooming them to serve her will, whether in the bed of one of her lovers, as her personal spy or as a martyr to one of her political causes. Her single-mindedness in devoting her ''prime'' to her students has consequences for every life she touches, from the men who love her to the student who is the author of her undoing.         Jay Presson Allen's adaptation for the stage became a vehicle in London in 1964 for Vanessa Redgrave, on Broadway in 1968 for Zoe Caldwell, who won a Tony for her performance, and in Hollywood in 1969 for Maggie Smith, who won an Oscar for best actress in the role.         No other book by Ms. Spark has received the widespread popular acclaim and exposure of ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' but in subsequent interviews, the author expressed a firm preference for dwelling on the future rather than the past.         In 1965 she published ''The Mandelbaum Gate,'' a heftier book and one that seems overstuffed by her standards. Set in Jerusalem against the backdrop of the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, ''The Mandelbaum Gate'' tackles questions of religion, memory and history superimposed on a torturous plot. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial prize.         In ''The Driver's Seat,'' published in 1970, a woman embarks on a wild search through Europe for the man who will kill her. With ''Hothouse on the East River'' in 1973, she moved the locale to New York, and the next year she responded to the Watergate scandal with ''The Abbess of Crewe,'' her own tale of burglars and stolen secrets set in yet another type of institution -- a convent. ''The Only Problem,'' in 1984, returns to the book of Job for inspiration.         Divine retribution of a sort neatly ties up her book ''Aiding and Abetting'' (2000), a fictional tale of a real man, Lord Lucan, known as Lucky, who killed his children's nanny, whom he apparently mistook for his wife in the dark, severely battered his wife, then disappeared, with the help of his friends. In the novel, two men claim to be the aging Lord Lucan, and both present themselves to a very high-priced Paris therapist who is fleeing her own past -- that of a fraudulent stigmatic.         Her last book, ''The Finishing School'' (2004), revisits the themes of boarding schools and envy.         Ms. Spark was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1967, became a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and in 1997 won the David Cohen Literature Prize for lifetime achievement.         She took issue, however, with the label ''British writer.'' She told one interviewer, ''I am Scottish by formation.'' She pointed out repeatedly that the bulk of her life had been spent in other countries. After London, she lived briefly in New York in the 1960's, then abandoned the crush of the literary world for Rome, where she had a rich social life and entertained lavishly.         Alliance and Estrangement         In Rome, she met the painter and sculptor Penelope Jardine, who became her secretary and later her companion. The two women traveled together, lived together, and over the years their lives grew deeply intertwined.         Interviewers repeatedly asked about the nature of the relationship of the two women who spent so many years together. Ms. Spark brushed aside the idea that their involvement was romantic; it was characterized as an ''old-fashioned friendship.''         Ms. Jardine purchased a sprawling medieval church compound in Tuscany, and they ultimately settled there. There Ms. Spark settled into her routine of writing in her favorite composition books, in longhand, using only pens untouched by other human hands, and rarely rewriting or revising what flowed from those pens. Ms. Jardine handled the business of everyday life, down to the typing of Ms. Spark's work.         When asked in an interview what she contributed to the household, Ms. Spark said she made her own bed, took morning tea to Ms. Jardine and took her out to meals. ''I think I pull my weight somehow or other,'' she said.         She saw her craft, she said in a 2004 interview, as driven by inspiration from an ''outside force'' unlocking memory in a manner derived from her reading of Marcel Proust.         ''It inspired me more than anything,'' she said at the time. ''I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found I rather liked writing prose.''         In her later years it became clear that she and her son, Robin, a painter who lives in Edinburgh, were irreconcilably estranged over various issues, including what he referred to as her abandonment of him, as well as her opinions about his ability as an artist and his public statements about their heritage.         Ms. Spark was harsh in her public criticism of his work and open about their estrangement. She told a newspaper: ''He can't sell his lousy paintings, and I have had a lot of success. He keeps sending them to me and I don't know what to do with them. I can't put them on my wall. He's never done anything for me, except for being one big bore.''         Their public feud extended to their religions and spilled into letters to newspapers and became a part of Ms. Spark's literary history when she donated letters from her son to the National Library of Scotland. Mr. Spark, who embraced Judaism about the same time his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, insisted that her mother had been Jewish, which by matrilineal inheritance would make him Jewish by birth; Ms. Spark, who considered herself only half-Jewish, maintained that though her father was Jewish, her mother was not.         Critics have disagreed on how to classify her work, which is alternately bleak and side-splitting. John Updike spoke of ''fun-house plots, full of trapdoors, abrupt apparitions and smartly clicking secret panels.'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called her a ''profoundly serious comic writer whose wit advances, never undermines or diminishes, her ideas.''         Taking the opposite view, Robert Maurer questioned the emotional underpinnings of her fiction, writing, ''One wonders how vast a reserve of sympathy lies beneath the iceberg of her consciousness, and how far beyond trickery her work would go if she let it show through.''         Ms. Spark said in several interviews that she would rather not fit neatly into any literary category. ''I have a comic strain, but my novels are serious,'' she said in 1993. ''Sometimes one makes one's own category, you know.''         Correction:  July 18, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary on April 16 about the novelist Muriel Spark misstated the date of her death. It was April 13, not April 14. The error was pointed out by a reader last week; the correction was further delayed for research.       
         Ellen Kuzwayo, the lone woman and the least flashy of the founders of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and a quiet moral force throughout the rise of the African National Congress from outlaw movement to governing party, died Wednesday in Johannesburg. She was 91.         The cause was complications of diabetes, her son Bobo told The South African Press Association.         Along with playing a role in fighting white oppression, Ms. Kuzwayo was also an early leader of the struggle of African women for equality with their men.         Her 1985 autobiography, ''Call Me Woman,'' described her beatings by her first husband and her loss of their children to him when they separated, because by law and tradition she was a minor. With it, she became the first black writer to win South Africa's premier literary prize, the CNA Award.         After Nelson Mandela's inauguration as president in 1994, she became, at the age of 79, a member of the first multiracial Parliament and served for five years.         At her death, Ms. Kuzwayo still lived in Soweto, the vast, isolated satellite city of tiny tract homes and jammed squatter camps a few miles from Johannesburg, a product of the determination of South Africa's white rulers to eject from their midst all blacks not employed as their domestic servants.         After the 1976 Soweto riots, set off by police shootings of schoolchildren protesting the forced change to the Afrikaans language in class, Ms. Kuzwayo became the lone woman on the Committee of 10, which informally governed the township when residents resisted paying rent to the despised Urban Bantu Council, appointed by the white government.         As a result, she was imprisoned without charge for five months in 1977.         In her 1996 testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated apartheid-era crimes, she described her predawn arrest, hiding in the bathroom trying to bathe and dress as police horses trampled her yard, and instructing Bobo, then a teenager, to keep a sharp eye out so that the police did not plant evidence as they searched.         She later helped establish the Urban Foundation, which pressed the government to let blacks own their houses, and she was a longtime adviser of the Zamani Soweto Sisters Council, the umbrella body for women's self-help groups; the first president of the Black Consumer Union; and the general secretary of the Y.W.C.A.         Ms. Kuzwayo, whose name before her marriage was Nnoseng Ellen Serasengwe, was born June 29, 1914, in the Orange Free State, an Afrikaner-dominated farming region, into a family of ministers and teachers; her maternal grandfather graduated from a missionary college in 1879 and had been the headmaster of a multiracial boys school and a court interpreter.         At 22, she began attending local African National Congress conferences with her father.         She later inherited the 6,000-acre farm owned by her mother's family, but lost it in the 1970's when the area was rezoned for white ownership only.         In the 1940's, she joined Mr. Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and others in forming the breakaway African National Congress Youth League, a more militant offshoot of the Congress, and served as its secretary. Mr. Mandela later formed its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation. He was convicted in 1964 on charges of treason and sabotage and imprisoned until 1990.         She became a teacher in 1938, but quit the profession in 1952 when the Native Education laws were supplanted by the Bantu Education Act, and missionary schools were closed.         ''I did not have the strength nor the courage to teach the children of my community what appeared to be very poisonous to their minds,'' she said later. ''The National Party gave them an inferior education so those children were going to remain the slaves of white people.''         She became a social worker, eventually becoming a revered figure in Soweto, known as Ma K, giving advice to women's groups, churches and schools and earning a salary from the social work department of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.         Besides her son Bobo, she is survived by another son, Justice; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         One of her most common laments was the lasting damage that apartheid and the violent fight against it had done to South Africa's children. The film ''Tsotsi,'' which won an Oscar as best foreign film this year, vividly shows the lives of young thugs on the Soweto-Johannesburg trains, and in 1996, Ms. Kuzwayo described to the truth commission the changes she had seen in young men like them.         In her early days as a social worker, she said, ''Sometimes after sunset I would be going through Orlando Station to go to my home, and it would be dark, and if I saw a group of young men standing there, I just ordered them to take me home.''         ''They would be grousing that they should be doing something else rather than taking this old lady home, but they obeyed. Believe you me, today I cannot do that, because I don't trust the very children who ought to protect me because of the handling of the government of South Africa of those days. They turned our children into animals.''         She herself was in a famous film about crime and injustice in South Africa, the 1951 version of ''Cry, the Beloved Country,'' starring Sidney Poitier. She had a small role as a shebeen queen -- the owner of an illegal Soweto tavern.       
         Katherine Dunham, the dancer, choreographer, teacher and anthropologist whose pioneering work introduced much of the black heritage in dance to the stage, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Her death was confirmed by Dr. Glory Van Scott, a friend and former Dunham dancer. Miss Dunham also had homes in East St. Louis, Ill., where she had run inner-city cultural programs for decades, and in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.         By creating popular and glamorous revues based on African and Caribbean folklore, Miss Dunham acquainted audiences, both on Broadway and around the world, with the historical roots of black dance.         In the late 1930's she founded the nation's first self-supporting black modern-dance troupe, one that visited more than 50 countries on six continents. Her achievements came at a time of racial discrimination, which she fought against, refusing to return to segregated theaters in the South. ''We weren't pushing 'Black Is Beautiful,' we just showed it,'' she once wrote. One of her works, ''Southland,'' depicted a lynching.         Miss Dunham also became attached to Haiti and its culture, first arriving there as a young anthropologist. She later became a priestess of the Vaudun religion. In 1992, at the age of 82 and suffering from arthritis, she staged a much-publicized 47-day hunger strike to protest repatriation of Haitian refugees.         In East St. Louis, she found talented young people living in one of the nation's most destitute areas and turned them into dancers. Describing her work there, she said her aim was ''to make the individual aware of himself and his environment, to create a desire to be alive.''         Miss Dunham was a recipient of some of the most prestigious awards in the arts, including the Presidential Medal of the Arts, the Albert Schweitzer Prize (presented at Carnegie Hall), Kennedy Center Honors and decorations from the French and Haitian governments.         In her dance technique, Miss Dunham emphasized the isolation of individual parts of the body. Some of her concepts continue to be taught at modern-dance schools across America. Her work was an important influence on Alvin Ailey, among other contemporary choreographers.         George Balanchine cast Miss Dunham in a major role in ''Cabin in the Sky,'' a Broadway musical starring Ethel Waters, which he staged and choreographed in 1940. She then went to Hollywood and danced in and choreographed the movies ''Carnival of Rhythm'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942) and ''Stormy Weather'' (1943), among others. It was in the 40's that Miss Dunham developed the fast-paced shows for which she was celebrated. ''Tropical Revue,'' successfully produced on Broadway in 1943, also toured the nation to much acclaim. Its sensuality also drew complaints, and it was cut, and finally closed, in Boston.         Miss Dunham was born on June 22, 1909 in Glen Ellyn, Ill. Her father, Albert Millard Dunham, was a descendant of slaves from Madagascar and West Africa. Her French Canadian mother, Fanny June Taylor, died when Miss Dunham was young. Her father then married Annette Poindexter, a schoolteacher from Iowa, and moved his family to predominantly white Joliet, Ill., where he ran a dry-cleaning business.         Always interested in the theater, Miss Dunham shocked neighbors when, at 15, she announced she would stage a ''cabaret party'' to aid a Methodist Church. Later, she confessed that she had scarcely known what ''cabaret'' meant.         Miss Dunham attended Joliet Junior College and the University of Chicago, where she received her bachelor's degree, going on to a doctorate in anthropology there. She also studied dance in Chicago with Ludmilla Speranzeva and Mark Turbyfill, a choreographer and poet, with whom she established the short-lived Ballet N√®gre in 1930. Ruth Page, a prominent Chicago choreographer, cast her in ''La Guiablesse,'' a ballet based on Martinique folklore that was performed at the Chicago Civic Opera House in 1933.         The following year, Miss Speranzeva helped Miss Dunham establish the Chicago Negro School of Ballet and a company, the Negro Dance Group, which evolved into the Katherine Dunham Dance Company. She did her anthropological field work in the Caribbean as a graduate student in 1935, receiving a Rosenwald Fellowship to study traditional dances in Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad and Haiti, where she became close to Haitians and took up the Vaudun religion. Over the years Miss Dunham spent much time in Haiti and in 1961 established a medical clinic there.         In the United States, she worked with the Federal Theater in Chicago, where she met John Pratt, an artist and designer to whom she was married from 1941 until his death in 1986. He also managed her career. Their daughter, Marie Christine Dunham Pratt, of Rome, who survives her.         Miss Dunham took her Negro Dance Group to New York in 1937 but did not attract wide attention there until 1939, when she choreographed ''Pins and Needles,'' a satirical revue produced by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.         Her popular appearance on Broadway as Georgia Brown in ''Cabin in the Sky'' at the Martin Beck Theater led to Hollywood and her celebrated revues of the early 40's. Later revues included ''Carib Song'' (1945), ''Bal N√®gre'' (1946), ''Caribbean Rhapsody'' (1948) and ''Bamboche'' (1962). They consisted of brief, vivid numbers inspired by African, Caribbean or African-American dance forms. In 1945, she founded the Dunham School of Dance and Theater in New York. Until it closed a decade later, it offered courses in dance, acting, psychology, philosophy, music, design and foreign languages.         After World War II, her dance company toured constantly, visiting more than 50 countries in 30 years. ''Judging from reactions,'' she said at one point, ''the dancing of my group is called anthropology in New Haven, sex in Boston and in Rome -- art!''         She also continued to choreograph in New York. In 1963 she became the first African-American to choreograph at the Metropolitan Opera since 1934, startling audiences with her lusty dances for a production of Verdi's ''Aida.'' Writing in The New York Times, the critic Allen Hughes said: ''There is 'modern' in it, belly-dancing, the foot-stamping and hip-and-shoulder shaking of primitive African dancing and much more. All pure Dunham.''         Miss Dunham began an association with Southern Illinois University in 1964 when she choreographed Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Carbondale campus. In 1967, she moved to its Edwardsville campus and founded the Performing Arts Training Center in nearby East St. Louis.         She did more than offer courses there. Her collection of African and Haitian art became the basis for the community's Katherine Dunham Dynamic Museum, which opened there in the late-1970's. She also counseled disadvantaged young people, and her colleagues noted that she could calm the angriest of them through the sheer power of her presence, making her ordinarily soft voice even softer -- yet always firm -- as the counseling session proceeded. Miss Dunham was also the author of many books, some published under the pseudonym Kaye Dunn. Her books including ''Journey to Accompong'' (1946), ''A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood'' (1959), ''Island Possessed'' (1969) and ''Dances of Haiti'' (1984).         Miss Dunham remained relatively active in her last years. On May 11, she appeared at the Morgan Library in Manhattan for a screening of ''Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball,'' an ABC special, broadcast on Monday, celebrating Ms. Winfrey's personal heroes, Miss Dunham among them. She was resplendent in a kente-inflected robe set off with a large paisley scarf.         Earlier in the month she had appeared at La Boule Blanche (the White Ball) at Riverside Church, an event organized by her friend Dr. Scott to celebrate the publication of an anthology of writings by and about Miss Dunham. The book, ''Kaiso!,'' edited by V√®V√® A. Clark and Sara E. Johnson, was recently released by University of Wisconsin Press. The title is a Calypso expression meaning, ''Bravo!''         Correction:  June 1, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on May 23 about the dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham omitted a credit for the choreography in the 1940 Broadway musical ''Cabin in the Sky,'' in which she performed. It was by George Balanchine in collaboration with Miss Dunham; it was not solely by Balanchine. Because of an editing error, the obituary misidentified an award Miss Dunham received in 1979 at Carnegie Hall. It was the Albert Schweitzer Music Award, not the Albert Schweitzer Prize.       
         Judith Moore, the author of ''Fat Girl,'' a searingly angry and widely praised memoir about being overweight, died on May 15 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 66.         The cause was colon cancer, said her daughter Rebecca Moore.         ''I am a short, squat toad of a woman,'' Ms. Moore wrote in ''Fat Girl,'' which was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award last year when it was published.         She continued: ''My upper arms are as big as those maroon-skinned bolognas that hang from butchers' ceilings. My belly juts out. The skin on my thighs is pocked.''         ''I hate myself,'' she wrote. ''I have almost always hated myself.''         At the heart of ''Fat Girl'' is the story of a brutal childhood. Ms. Moore was born in Stillwater, Okla. Her parents divorced when she was young. Her father, a lawyer, was obese, her mother slender. As a child Ms. Moore was shuttled between her mother and her maternal grandmother, both of whom beat her, she said. But her grandmother liked to cook, and so Judith devoured food, desperate to fill the emptiness inside her. And as she grew fat, both women derided her.         Yet alongside the bitterness in ''Fat Girl'' are sensuous descriptions of food, ''three-layer coconut cakes and huckleberry and peach and boysenberry cobblers, crisp gingerbread cookies, Kadota figs afloat in clotted cream, cows' thick milk.''         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the author Jane Stern called the book ''brilliant and angry and unsettling.''         With her mordant humor and tart style, Ms. Moore was sometimes compared to another California writer, Joan Didion.         Ms. Moore published two earlier books. ''The Left Coast of Paradise: California and the American Heart,'' a collection of essays published in 1987, included pieces on the political philosopher Herbert Marcuse, on a neurotic elephant and on a philosophically minded pimp. ''Never Eat Your Heart Out,'' in 1997, was also a memoir about her life and food, though without the anger of ''Fat Girl.''         Ms. Moore was also a senior editor at The San Diego Reader, a weekly newspaper, where she was known for her almost uncanny intuition about how to bring out the best in writers.         Ms. Moore married and divorced twice. In addition to Rebecca, of Dunedin, Fla., she is survived by a second daughter, Sarah Sullivan of Tacoma, Wash., and a grandson.         Though Ms. Moore wrote in tones of self-loathing about being fat, and was at times overweight, she was not morbidly obese. Sometimes her weight was within normal range, Rebecca Moore said.         So why did she always portray herself in books as a huge woman, hideous in her immensity? ''It was essentially what was beaten into her,'' Rebecca Moore said. ''No matter how fat she was, or how thin, she was always that fat girl.''       
         Carlene R. Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose early suspicions about the safety of the pain reliever Vioxx put her in the forefront of what is now a wave of litigation against its maker, Merck, died Monday in Houston. She was 51.         The cause was complications of ovarian cancer, according to her husband, Greg Lewis.         Ms. Lewis first began looking into possible dangers of Vioxx in the fall of 2000. She investigated claims that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes in long-term users. Five years later, in August 2005, she was part of a team of three lawyers that won a verdict of $253.5 million against Merck in a state court in Texas, one of the largest damage awards ever to a single plaintiff.         The Association of American Trial Lawyers said yesterday that before her death Ms. Lewis had been chosen to receive its annual award for public service for her efforts against Vioxx. Her family is to accept the award at the association's convention in Seattle.         ''This is a story of her determination,'' said Miriam Bourdette, a member of the association's board of governors. ''She got a lot of other lawyers involved in this at a very early stage.''         Merck has said it will appeal the Texas case and two others it has lost. Two juries have ruled in its favor. More than 20 million people had taken Vioxx before Merck took it off the market in September 2004, and the company is facing 11,500 lawsuits in behalf of 23,000 plaintiffs. About a dozen cases are scheduled for trial before the end of this year.         Christopher Seeger, a New York lawyer who joined forces with Ms. Lewis against Vioxx in 2001, said: ''She was the first lawyer I know to begin investing money and really investigating whether Vioxx was a safe drug or whether it was causing heart attacks. She concluded in 2001 that this drug ought to be off the market and she was vindicated in 2004.''         Ms. Lewis starting investigating Vioxx after a friend of her mother's said she had become ill after taking the drug and soon lost her job, according to Shelly Sanford, one of her law partners. Ms. Lewis wrote two letters to Merck seeking to negotiate a settlement in behalf of her mother's friend, Ms. Sanford said, but both offers were rejected.         ''Then she went about the litigation process,'' Ms. Sanford said.         As lawsuits against Merck began to multiple, Ms. Lewis was appointed by a federal judge to a panel of lawyers charged with overseeing the gathering of records concerning Vioxx from the company. She was also appointed to a similar panel in connection with litigation against Pfizer involving the drug Bextra, which, like Vioxx belongs to a class of pain-reducing drugs known as cox-2 inhibitors.         Carlene Rhodes Lewis was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 28, 1954. She graduated with honors from Harvard in 1976 and received an award as the outstanding female athlete of her class. She taught at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., before going to law school at the University of Virginia. She graduated in 1983.         In 1984, she joined the firm of Sewell & Riggs in Houston and specialized in defending corporations in product liability suits. Five years later, she and a colleague at Sewell & Riggs, Daniel Goforth, formed the firm now known as Goforth Lewis Sanford. She eventually focused on representing plaintiffs.         Besides her husband, Ms. Lewis is survived by two daughters, Carla and Christy; her mother, Alene Rhodes of Houston; and her brother, Tim Rhodes of South Shores, N.C.       
         Gloria Jones, whose marriage to the author James Jones placed her at the center of a postwar literary and social world in Paris and the Hamptons and whose own life became the basis of a novel and a movie, died on Friday at her home in Sagaponack, N.Y. She was 78.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Kaylie Jones of Manhattan.         In 1998 a character drawn from Mrs. Jones was central in the film ''A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' based on an autobiographical novel by her daughter. The movie, in which Barbara Hershey plays the mother, is about an expatriate family in Paris and its difficulties after the adoption of a French boy.         From 1959 to 1974, Mr. and Mrs. Jones lived in Paris, where they adopted their son, Jamie, who now lives in Washington.         Mr. Jones was already famous for his 1951 novel, ''From Here to Eternity,'' and the 1953 blockbuster movie based on it, portraying American soldiers and their lovers in Hawaii before the attack on Pearl Harbor.         In Paris the couple were celebrities and celebrated hosts. Their guests, her daughter recalled, included the authors Mary McCarthy, James Baldwin, Romain Gary and William Styron and the actors Peter Lawford and Jean Seberg.         After their return, the couple bought a farmhouse in Sagaponack, in the Hamptons on the South Fork of Long Island. It became a gathering spot for friends like Arthur Miller, Norman Mailer, Peter Matthiessen and Kurt Vonnegut. Mr. Jones died in 1977.         In 1985 a biography of Mr. Jones by Frank MacShane, ''Into Eternity: The Life of James Jones, American Writer'' (Houghton Mifflin), quoted the author Irwin Shaw describing Mrs. Jones as ''the candle that kept the house alight,'' as hostess and as guardian of her husband's literary reputation after his death.         Before marrying in 1957, Mrs. Jones was a movie stand-in for Marilyn Monroe in ''The Seven Year Itch'' and for Eva Marie Saint in ''On the Waterfront,'' and a dance partner of Arthur Murray on his television show in the 1950's.         Gloria Mosolino Jones was born in Pottsville, Pa., on June 6, 1928. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1949. Besides her daughter and son, she is survived by a brother, Mark Mosolino of Bethel Hill, Pa., and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara Epstein, a founder and co-editor of The New York Review of Books and a figure at the center of New York literary life for decades, died yesterday in the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in which she had lived for more than 50 years. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her son, Jacob, said. He added that his mother, whose cancer was diagnosed in September 2005, was in her office as recently as two and a half weeks ago.         For much of her career, Ms. Epstein was famous for being part of a tandem. During the 1950's and 60's, she and her husband at the time, Jason, were the first couple of publishing, powerful book editors who knew everyone and gave the kind of high-octane dinner parties that warranted mention in Edmund Wilson's journals.         With Robert Silvers, her co-editor at The New York Review, she had an office partnership that endured even longer than her marriage, which ended in divorce in 1980.         ''Barbara was one of the most influential editors of our time,'' the writer Janet Malcolm said. ''But she had none of the qualities -- aggressiveness, ruthlessness, egotism -- that are commonly associated with powerful editors. Barbara's uncommon modesty, gentleness and charm were the source of a certain mysteriousness. They were also, of course, entirely of a piece with the magazine she and Bob Silvers put out.''         Ms. Epstein was born Barbara Zimmerman, the younger of two sisters, in Boston in 1928. Her father sold textiles and her mother was a homemaker. She attended Girls Latin School and graduated in 1949 from Radcliffe.         She began her editorial career as an assistant at Doubleday, then quickly rose to prominence there as the editor of Anne Frank's ''Diary of a Young Girl,'' among other books. She went on to work at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and The Partisan Review. In 1954 she married Mr. Epstein. Their children, Jacob, of Los Angeles, and Helen, of Brooklyn, survive her, as do three grandchildren.         It was at the Epsteins' dinner table, during the winter of 1962, that the idea for The New York Review of Books was hatched. New York's daily newspapers were on strike, and the absence of The New York Times Book Review had stranded publishers with no place to advertise their books and authors with no place for their work to be written about. To fill the vacuum, Mr. and Mrs. Epstein, together with Robert Lowell and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, who were guests that evening, decided to put out a book review of their own. ''Jason was, like, 'Kids, let's put on a show,' '' Ms. Epstein recalled.         The strike ended in February, but The Review, which had by then come out twice, was so successful that Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers, who had been recruited as co-editor, decided to keep it going. It became one of the most influential and admired journals of its kind, attracting a high-powered roster of writers. The books reviewed and those who reviewed them were all carefully hand picked, causing many to view the magazine as a kind of private club.         Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers made an unusual literary tag team. He is large and formidable. She was small, friendly and enthusiastic. They informally divided the literary turf between them. Mr. Silvers claimed history, politics, science and art history; Ms. Epstein looked after the arts and more literary books. But philosophically they saw eye to eye.         ''We were such close partners in the way of sharing every commission, every manuscript, every decision,'' Mr. Silvers said yesterday. Ms. Epstein, he said, read every manuscript that made it into The Review.         The poet James Fenton said: ''The system was always that whichever was actually editing you, the other was always checking in. Nothing was done by one without the participation of the other.''         Ms. Epstein was famous for putting articles though multiple revisions if necessary, sending out what were known as the A, B, C and sometimes the D and E proofs. ''She was the fiercest editor,'' the writer Diane Johnson, a close friend, recalled. ''Very much the perfectionist, but in a very sympathetic way.''         And she was arguably the more fun-loving of The New York Review's ruling pair, reliably turning up at book parties, no matter how obscure, except on evenings when she was giving her own. Her companion of many years after her divorce was the columnist Murray Kempton, who died in 1997.         ''She loved Champagne,'' the writer Nora Ephron recalled, ''and she herself had this quality that was so fizzy and festive, with such an appetite for trivia and gossip, that you completely forgot she was the editor of The New York Review.''       
         Dorothy Hayden Truscott, for many years the top-ranked woman in bridge and the winner of four world titles and more than two dozen national championships, died on Tuesday in New Russia, N.Y. She was 80.         Her death was announced by her daughter Margaret Cooke. It followed a long battle with Parkinson's disease.         Mrs. Truscott won four world titles as a player: the Venice Cup in 1974, 1976 and 1978, and the Women's Team Olympiad in 1980. She was the nonplaying captain of the winning American Venice Cup team in 1989.         Dorothy Johnson was born in New York City on Nov. 3, 1925, four days after Harold S. Vanderbilt had introduced his new game, contract bridge, to three friends while sailing the Panama Canal. She graduated from Smith College and briefly became a math teacher in Kalamazoo, Mich.         Bridge was already an important part of her life. Her parents, Dorothy and Reginald Johnson, were keen players and had taught her the game when she was 7. Normally Mrs. Truscott would watch her mother play, but if her father was pouring some drinks, she would bid and play his hand. Then one evening a player arrived an hour late, and Mrs. Truscott filled in. She was addicted for life.         Mrs. Truscott moved to Park Forest, Ill., and one afternoon a week took the train into Chicago to play rubber bridge. She returned to New York City in 1956 and worked for three years as an actuary at New York Life Insurance.         It was clear, though, that bridge would be a major element of her life. She won the first of her national titles in 1959, and in 1965 became the second woman to play for the United States in the Bermuda Bowl world team championship. (The first was Helen Sobel.) Mrs. Truscott competed in Buenos Aires and was one of the main accusers in a major bridge scandal involving cheating allegations against the British pair of Terence Reese and Boris Schapiro.         She won one world silver medal, from the 1965 Bermuda Bowl, and six world bronze medals, from the Open Pairs in 1966 (she is the only woman to win a medal in this event); the Women's Team Olympiads in 1968, 1972 and 1976; and the Women's Pairs in 1962 and 1974.         Mrs. Truscott was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League's Hall of Fame in 1998.         Mrs. Truscott's first two marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by three daughters, Catherine Hayden Thurston of Cambridge, Mass., Margaret Cooke of Painted Post, N.Y., and Bobette Thorsen of Lititz, Pa., and 10 grandchildren. Her son William died in July 1951, and her son Brian died in January 1992. Her husband since 1972, Alan Truscott, the bridge columnist for The New York Times, died last year.         Also an excellent bridge teacher, Mrs. Truscott wrote two best-selling bridge books, ''Winning Declarer Play'' (1969) and ''Bid Better, Play Better'' (1970). With her husband she wrote ''Teach Yourself Basic Bidding'' (1976-77) and ''The New York Times Bridge Book'' (2002). Also in 2002, she published ''Hell Gate,'' a historical novel about early Dutch settlers in Harlem.       
         Dorothea Towles Church, the first successful black model in Paris, who discovered personal liberation on the runways of Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1950's, died on July 7 in Manhattan. She was 83.         Her death was confirmed by Michael Henry Adams, a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, where she is among those to be featured in an exhibition called ''Black Style Now,'' opening on Sept. 7.         Ms. Church's success was a historic achievement in an industry that had been especially resistant to using any but white models to represent beauty on magazine covers, advertisements and runways. Ms. Church was responsible for breaking down some of those barriers and was revered in France during the five years she modeled there.         ''If you're beautiful, they don't care what color you are,'' she said of the French, describing her days in the couture salons and nights in postwar Paris.         ''I got invited out all the time,'' she said in Barbara Summers's 1998 book ''Black and Beautiful.'' ''I was the only black model in Europe and I just thought I was an international person.''         Her easy acceptance in Paris was reported back home in black publications, in articles about the designers she knew and how she once dyed her hair platinum at Dior's request.         But her growing fame did not eliminate prejudice on the part of some designers. At Schiaparelli, she once overheard someone describe her as Tahitian. While working for Pierre Balmain, she recalled, he would not allow her to borrow dresses for a photograph for Ebony magazine, fearing that would offend his white clientele. She took the clothes later on the pretext that she would wear them to a party, and the magazine then photographed them. This particular ruse endeared her to young black women with dreams of careers in fashion.         Norma Jean Darden, a former model and an owner of Spoonbread Catering in Manhattan, said: ''When I was 13 years old, I remember reading in Ebony magazine that there was this marvelous woman who had gone to Paris and broken through the color barriers. She was a true inspiration for those who followed fashion.''         Dorothea Towles was born on July 26, 1922, in Texarkana, Tex., the seventh of eight children in a farming family. She studied biology at Wiley College in Marshall, Tex., and planned to go into medicine, but when her mother died, she accepted the invitation of a wealthy uncle to live with him in Los Angeles. She completed a master's degree in education there at the University of Southern California.         In search of a profession, Ms. Church was attracted by the glamour of Los Angeles, so her friends suggested the movies. But there were few roles for black actors, and Ms. Church described herself as more commercially minded. She thought she could succeed in modeling, and enrolled in the Dorothy Farrier Charm and Modeling School as its first black student.         She then found jobs on the West Coast in fashion shows and magazines that catered to black audiences, and a husband, a much older dentist who spoiled her. In 1949, while on a two-month vacation in Paris, where her sister Lois Towles was touring with the concert choir of Fisk University, Ms. Church decided to try modeling there. Dior hired her on the spot to replace one of his regulars, who was on vacation. Ms. Church found that she liked Paris so much that she informed her husband she was staying.         ''He wrote me and even called me, but I told him I wasn't coming back,'' she said. ''He finally got tired, and then he got a lawyer and sued for divorce.''         After a few months, Ms. Church began using her model's discount to buy samples from the designers, piece by piece, until she had assembled several wardrobes' worth of couture gowns that had rarely been seen by American audiences. In 1954, she returned to America by ship, because she had so much luggage, and began a tour of black colleges with her collection. She staged fashion shows and fund-raisers for more than 200 branches of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a college sorority established by black women. Ms. Darden, who was 18 when she met Ms. Church at a benefit show organized by her father for the N.A.A.C.P. in Montclair, N.J., became one of the models in her troupe.         Ms. Church later signed with the Grace del Marco modeling agency in New York, and worked there for several years. She met Thomas Church, a prominent immigration lawyer, shortly after arriving in New York, and they were married in 1963. Mr. Church died in 2000. Ms. Church is survived by their son, Thomas.         ''I feel that my going all over America with my show had a great influence on American black women dressing differently and feeling good about themselves,'' Ms. Church said in ''Black and Beautiful.'' ''I saw them dressing more creatively, more internationally. They could say, 'If she can do it, I can do it, too.' ''         Correction:  July 26, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Dorothea T. Church, the first successful black model in Paris, gave an outdated date for the opening of an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, ''Black Style Now,'' in which she will be featured. It is Sept. 9, not Sept. 7.       
         Reathel Odum, a bank clerk who was chosen by Senator Harry S. Truman during the Depression to be one of his secretaries and later served in the White House as personal secretary to Bess Truman, died in her hometown, Benton, Ill., on June 6. She was 97.         Miss Odum's nephew, Richard Odum Hart, said news of her death was not released for several weeks.         In 17 years with the Trumans -- including two years chaperoning their daughter, Margaret, when she was making national tours as an aspiring classical singer -- Miss Odum became close to the family.         ''People have urged me to write a book and I said no,'' she said in a 1988 oral history for the Truman Presidential Museum and Library in Independence, Mo. ''I don't know anything that would be tantalizing or gossipy.''         If it does not offer significant historical observations, Miss Odum's oral history does provide interesting glimpses of Truman and his family, for example, how much he missed Mrs. Truman when she went home to Independence in the summer.         ''He'd put his head in the office door and say, 'Is there any mail from the Boss? If there isn't, I'm going to fire every one of you,' '' Miss Odum recalled. ''That was a standing joke.''         While Truman had a reputation for spicy language, Miss Odum said: ''He never did swear in front of us girls. He put women on a pedestal.''         Asked about Mrs. Truman's role as first lady, Miss Odum said, ''After meeting so many people and shaking their hands at receptions, she would go to her room and soak her hand in paraffin.''         Born on Sept. 29, 1908, Miss Odum was the youngest of five children. Her father died when she was 4, and her mother raised the family. Miss Odum, who never married, has no immediate survivors.         She graduated from Benton Township High School in 1926 and soon got a job at a local bank. One day 10 years later, Truman walked into a bank in St. Louis where Miss Odum was working and told its president, a friend, that he needed a secretary. The bank president recommended Miss Odum. ''I was scared to death,'' she recalled. ''I had never talked to a senator before.''         Miss Odum arrived at Truman's Senate office in Washington in October 1936 and worked there until 1945. She and Mrs. Truman volunteered together at the local U.S.O. during World War II. ''We peeled carrots and did whatever to help entertain soldiers away from home,'' Miss Odum said. Often, they took bike rides around the Tidal Basin.         Truman became vice president in 1945; less than three months later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was dead. On his first full day as president, Truman asked Miss Odum to be Mrs. Truman's personal secretary.         Unlike Eleanor Roosevelt, Mrs. Truman did not like to speak to reporters. Sometimes a ''press girl'' would call and ask what Mrs. Truman would be wearing to a reception, Miss Odum said, and the first lady would say, ''It's none of their business.''         In 1947, Miss Odum began accompanying Margaret Truman on her concert tours. Asked how Miss Truman reacted to music critics, Miss Odum said: ''She tried not to read the reviews. She had determination to go ahead despite the critics.''         After her White House service, which ended when Truman left office in 1953, Miss Odum worked as a secretary for Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri, for a coal industry lobbying group and then for the Truman Scholarship Foundation.         Whenever the Trumans returned to Washington, she said, ''I'd go over to the Mayflower and say hello.''         Correction:  August 9, 2006, Wednesday  A picture on July 24 with an obituary of Reathel Odum, secretary to Bess Truman when she was first lady, was published in error. The photograph, released by The Associated Press in 1945 and identified as Miss Odum, was actually Jane Lingo (a friend of President Truman's daughter, Margaret).       
         Dika Newlin, who composed a symphony at 11, became a distinguished composer and musicologist and emerged, in her 70's and 80's, as a most unlikely punk rocker, died on July 22 in Richmond, Va. She was 82.         The cause was complications of a broken arm she suffered on June 30, said Sabine Feisst, a professor of musicology at Arizona State University who is writing a book on Dr. Newlin.         ''It is hard to find out about me because I'm involved in so many different things,'' Dr. Newlin said in an interview with The Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1996. One continuing thread: she was a professor at various universities, until her retirement from Virginia Commonwealth University two years ago.         Her latest incarnation was as leather-clad, bright-orange-haired punk rocker and occasional Elvis impersonator, belting out songs like ''Love Songs for People Who Hate Each Other,'' which she wrote herself. Her flamboyant image was not exactly dulled when she posed in her 70's for a pinup calendar.         Dr. Newlin's earlier prominence grew out of her studies as a teenager with the composer Arnold Schoenberg. Dr. Newlin, among the last surviving pupils of Schoenberg, wrote the entry on him for the Encyclopaedia Britannica.         Dr. Feisst called Dr. Newlin ''one of the pioneers of Schoenberg research in America.'' Dr. Newlin's doctoral dissertation was published as the book ''Bruckner, Mahler, Schoenberg'' (1947, 1968). She also translated Schoenberg's works from German to English, and her publication of diaries she kept as his student provide some of the most intimate glimpses of him.         Dr. Newlin's own compositions reflect Schoenberg's innovative approach. Those works include three operas, a chamber symphony, a piano concerto and numerous chamber, vocal and mixed-media works. In 1999, she sang in a costumed performance of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' in her own English translation, in Lubbock, Tex.         In her punk incarnation, Dr. Newlin appeared in horror movies produced by Michael D. Moore in Richmond. In ''Creep'' (1995), directed by Tim Ritter, her character, clad in a leather motorcycle jacket, poisons baby food on a supermarket shelf.         Dr. Feisst confessed to finding this sort of thing ''puzzling and disturbing'' but said she came to view it as ''all part of the package.''         Mr. Moore also directed ''Dika: Murder City'' (1995), a documentary about Dr. Newlin.         Dika Newlin, an only child, was born in Portland, Ore., on Nov. 22, 1923. Her name, chosen by her mother, refers to an Amazon in one of Sappho's poems.         Her parents, both academics, soon moved to East Lansing, Mich., to teach at what is now Michigan State University. Dika could read dictionaries at 3, played the piano at 6 and began composing at 7.         She entered grade school at 5 and finished at 8. At 11, she wrote a symphonic piece, ''Cradle Song.'' Three years later, it was performed by the Cincinnati Symphony, with Vladimir Bakaleinikoff conducting.         She finished high school at 12 and was accepted as a college student by Michigan State, where, The New York Herald Tribune said in 1939, she had the highest I.Q. score in the school's history. At the time of the article, she was in New York to hear one of her compositions performed at the World's Fair.         After graduating from Michigan State at 16, she settled with her mother in Los Angeles so that she could attend the University of California at Los Angeles and study with Schoenberg, who taught there. She kept a diary, which she published as a book, ''Schoenberg Remembered: Diaries and Recollections (1938-76),'' in 1980.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Joan Peyser marveled at its ''absolute ingenuousness,'' saying Dr. Newlin seemed to have censored nothing.         In one entry, she tells how Schoenberg, an Austrian √©migr√© she called Uncle Arnold, criticized her string-quartet style as ''too pianistic.'' She replied that she knew it wasn't the best writing. The entry continues, ''He replied, 'No, it is not the best, nor even the second best -- perhaps the 50th best, yes?' ''         She earned her doctorate in musicology from Columbia at 22. She studied piano with Artur Schnabel and Rudolf Serkin and made a half-dozen piano recordings in the United States and Europe. Many years later, in 2004, some of her punk numbers were released on an album called ''Ageless Icon: The Greatest Hits of Dika Newlin.''         Dr. Newlin, who never married, leaves no immediate family members. She has a surviving cousin and was close to her cat, Spot. She once kept eight or more cats. Reporters noted that she slept on a mattress on the floor with a medieval suit of armor dangling above.         She told The Richmond Times-Dispatch that she had always wanted to have a rock band, and hers surely carried her own brand. Who but Dr. Newlin could have taken the text Schoenberg used for the fourth movement of his second string quartet to use as punk lyrics for ''Alien Baby''?         ''I feel like a child more than I did as a child,'' she said in an interview with People magazine in 2003. ''I try more and more to live day by day, to do something because it feels good.''       
         Louise Simone Bennett-Coverly, a Jamaican poet and folklorist who became the voice of the island's culture at home and abroad, died on Wednesday in Toronto. She was 86.         Her death was announced by the Jamaica Information Service, which did not give a cause. She was hospitalized in Toronto after collapsing late Tuesday night.         A social commentator who liberally used Jamaican patois and made famous the Jamaican catchphrase ''Walk good,'' she brought an overwhelming talent to the stage, radio, television and movies. She also was a presenter on the BBC's Caribbean Service.         Louise Bennett, known to her fans worldwide as Miss Lou, was born on North Street in Kingston on Sept. 7, 1919, the only child of Cornelius Bennett, a baker, and Kerene Robinson, a dressmaker. Her father died when she was young, and she was reared mostly by her mother.         Ms. Bennett was educated in Jamaican schools, and though she was fond of literature, she once described herself as ''an average student.''         In 1936 she made her first public appearance, on Christmas Day at a concert, reciting a poem in Jamaican dialect. She was presented a prize of two guineas by the impresario Eric Winston Coverly, better known as Chalk Talk, who became her husband in 1954. She used the money to buy a pair of shoes.         She continued to write in dialect, following in the footsteps of the well-known Jamaican poet Claude McKay, although he only flirted with the style.         Not surprisingly, Ms. Bennett was ostracized by educated Jamaicans who saw the local patois as inferior to the Oxford English they tried to speak.         The island's newspaper The Gleaner refused at first to publish her poems, but later paid her for a regular Sunday column, which became popular.         Her published verse originated mostly as print or radio journalism, and her monologues often referred to the news, with shrewd social and political commentary. She invented the character of Aunty Roachy on the radio to ridicule the authorities with wit, sometimes ending her monologues with local proverbs.         Ms. Bennett performed in her first Christmas pantomime in 1943, and she and the stage actor Ranny Williams immediately became the leading duo of Jamaican theater. Together they wrote ''Anancy and Beeny Bud'' (1958), ''Jamaica Way'' (1959) and ''Carib Gold'' (1960). (Anancy, the famous trickster of African and Caribbean folklore, was a frequent subject for her.)         Also in 1943, she entered Friends' College, where she began to study Jamaican folklore seriously.         Ms. Bennett won a British Council Scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1945 and was the first black student there. After graduation she worked with British repertory companies. In 1945 and 1946 she was host of a BBC radio show, ''Caribbean Carnival.''         Returning to Jamaica in 1947, she found it hard to earn a living. In 1950 she went back to England, where she again found work with the BBC, as host of another Caribbean show, ''West Indian Night.''         Moving to New York in 1953, she worked at Macy's. She and Mr. Coverly directed a folk musical, ''Day in Jamaica,'' which began at St. Martin's Little Theater in Harlem and later moved around Episcopal church halls in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.         Ms. Bennett worked with Alma John, a well-known black broadcaster, and sang folk songs at the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village. Then, in May 1954, she married Mr. Coverly; they returned to Jamaica in 1955.         In 1956 she was appointed drama officer with the Jamaica Social Welfare Commission, then was its director from 1959 to 1963. Her work at the commission took her across Jamaica, putting her back in touch with her studies of its folklore and oral history.         She also taught drama and folklore at the University of the West Indies, and was on the staff of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation briefly in 1959, but resigned to pursue a freelance career.         Ms. Bennett was made a Member of the British Empire (M.B.E.) in 1960 for her work in Jamaican literature and theater.         Among her several books on poetry and folklore, ''Jamaica Labrish'' (1966) is perhaps her most famous. Her first publication was ''Dialect Verses'' (1942). She also recorded many albums, including ''Jamaica Folksongs'' (Folkways) in 1953 and ''Yes Me Dear'' (Island Records Jamaica) in 1981.         Ms. Bennett was perhaps the most popular radio personality in Jamaica in the 1950's and 60's, with shows like ''Laugh With Louise,'' ''Miss Lou's Views'' and ''The Lou and Ranny Show.'' In the 1970's Jamaican children adored ''Ring Ding,'' her Saturday morning children's television show.         In the 1970's a theater for children's productions was named for her; it was refurbished in 1987 to celebrate her 50th anniversary in the theater. In 1979 the Jamaica Information Service produced a film on her, ''The Hon. Miss Lou.''         Ms. Bennett and Mr. Coverly lived in Canada for several years. The Jamaican government had refused to grant duty concessions for costly drugs he needed, and they sold their home and possessions to make the move. She said at the time that Jamaica was wherever she was.         After she nursed him through years of ill health, her husband died at 91. Ms. Bennett is survived by her stepson, Fabian Coverly, and three step-grandsons.         She made a tearful and triumphant final visit to Jamaica in 2003 for a celebration organized by the former prime minister P. J. Patterson.       
         June Allyson, whose perky wholesomeness made her the perfect girlfriend in a series of MGM musicals during the 1940's and the perfect screen wife during the 1950's, died on Saturday at her home in Ojai, Calif. She was 88.         Her death was announced yesterday by her daughter, Pamela Allyson Powell. The cause was pulmonary respiratory failure and acute bronchitis, she told The Associated Press.         Cheerful, blonde and petite but with a husky voice, Miss Allyson turned from chorus girl into movie star when she melted into the arms of Van Johnson in ''Two Girls and a Sailor'' in 1944. For the next decade, Miss Allyson and Mr. Johnson were a romantic team, co-starring in ''High Barbaree'' (1947), ''The Bride Goes Wild'' (1948), ''Too Young to Kiss'' (1951), and ''Remains to Be Seen'' (1953).         She also starred twice opposite Robert Walker -- in ''Her Highness and the Bellboy'' (1945) and ''The Sailor Takes a Wife'' (1946) -- and played a bouncy Jo March in MGM's glossy 1949 remake of ''Little Women.''         By 1950, Miss Allyson had made the segue from adoring girlfriend to devoted wife. She was happy to leave musicals behind. Although she had started in the chorus on Broadway, she told an interviewer in 1951: ''I couldn't dance, and, Lord knows, I couldn't sing, but I got by somehow. Richard Rodgers was always keeping them from firing me.''         She was the steadfast wife of James Stewart's one-legged baseball player in ''The Stratton Story'' (1949); the widow left behind by Mr. Stewart's bandleader in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' (1953); the worried wife of Mr. Stewart's baseball player recalled to active duty in ''Strategic Air Command'' (1955); and the understanding wife who loses Alan Ladd's jet pilot to honor and duty in ''The McConnell Story ( 1955).         In ''Executive Suite'' (1954), she assured her husband, played by William Holden, who was vying for president of the Tredway Corporation, ''Darling, if it's something you really want, that's all that's important to either of us.''         Ms. Allyson was always modest about her star power. ''Women identify with me,'' she said in a 1986 intervew, ''and while men desire Cyd Charisse, they'd take me home to meet Mom.''         When Miss Allyson tried to move beyond Peter Pan collars and sugary characters as the harsh and nasty woman who pushes her husband (Jos√© Ferrer) into a nervous breakdown in ''The Shrike'' (1955), her acting was praised but audiences refused to accept her, and the movie was a box-office failure.         June Allyson was born Ella Geisman on Oct. 7, 1917, in the Bronx. Her alcoholic father skipped out when she was 6 months old. When she was 8, she was crushed by a falling tree limb while riding a bicycle. After four years in a back brace, she taught herself to dance by watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies.         The expensive therapy the injuries required tumbled the Geisman family out of genteel poverty into desperation. In her 1982 autobiography, ''June Allyson,'' written with Frances Spatz Leighton, Miss Allyson said she and her mother were forced to move countless times. The best months were when her mother had a job in a restaurant, she wrote, ''because sometimes she could bring home food.''         Recovering from her injuries, she tried out for and won a chorus job in a 1938 Broadway revue, ''Sing Out the News,'' taking the name June (for the month) Allyson. Between 1938 and 1941, Miss Allyson sang and danced in several Broadway shows, including ''Very Warm for May,'' ''Higher and Higher'' and ''Panama Hattie.'' As understudy to Betty Hutton, who played the comedy lead in ''Panama Hattie,'' Miss Allyson took over the part for five performances when Miss Hutton came down with measles. In a plot development worthy of an MGM musical, the producer George Abbott saw her performance and offered her a small featured role in his next musical, ''Best Foot Forward.'' MGM bought the movie rights to the musical, and Miss Allyson was invited to Hollywood to play her role on screen. She stayed at MGM for 11 years and 25 movies.         ''The only parental authority I had was the studio,'' Miss Allyson said in 1972. ''When I was a star, there was always somebody with me, to guard me. I was not allowed to be photographed with a cigarette, a drink, a cup of coffee or even a glass of water because someone might think it was liquor. When I left the studio I was already married and had two children, but I felt as sad as a child leaving home for the first time.''         A second-tier star at a studio that prided itself on owning ''more stars than there are in heaven,'' Miss Allyson defied the studio boss Louis B. Mayer in only one thing. She fell in love with the married movie star Dick Powell. Mr. Powell divorced his wife, the actress Joan Blondell, and married Miss Allyson in 1945, despite Mr. Mayer's opposition. Although the marriage was rocky at times -- Miss Allyson once filed for divorce -- it lasted until Mr. Powell's death from cancer in 1963 at age 58. In her autobiography she touched on her struggle with alcoholism after Mr. Powell's death.         Miss Allyson and Mr. Powell co-starred in two mediocre movies in 1950, ''The Reformer and the Redhead'' and ''Right Cross.'' Miss Allyson recalled being told that because of her childhood accident, she would never be able to have children, so she and Mr. Powell adopted a baby girl, Pamela, in 1948. Two years later, she gave birth to a son, Richard.         Pamela Allyson Powell now lives in Santa Monica, Calif. Richard, of Los Angeles, also survives Miss Allyson, as does her husband, David Ashrow, a dentist whom she married in 1976. A previous marriage, to Mr. Powell's hairdresser, Glenn Maxwell, in 1963, the year Mr. Powell died, ended in divorce.         Miss Allyson's film career had petered out in the late 1950's with a remake of ''My Man Godfrey '' (1957) opposite David Niven, and a sudsy Ross Hunter melodrama ''A Stranger in My Arms'' (1959). From 1959 to 1961, she was host of and occasionally starred in ''The DuPont Show With June Allyson,'' a dramatic anthology on CBS. After replacing Julie Harris as the star of ''40 Carats'' on Broadway and touring for a year in a revival of ''No, No Nanette,'' she returned to the screen and to MGM in 1972 as a lesbian murderess in ''They Only Kill Their Masters.'' She also appeared on ''Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and other television shows.         In 1985 she became the national spokeswoman for Depend, a diaper for adults with incontinence. Still wearing her trademark pageboy hairdo, she broke one of the last taboos by bringing this uncomfortable subject into the nation's living rooms by way of television commercials.         Writing about Miss Allyson's autobiography in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: ''Miss Allyson presents herself as the same sunny, tomboyish figure she played on screen. Even the tough parts of her life -- the death of her husband Dick Powell and her subsequent bout with alcoholism -- are described in a relatively blithe manner.'' Ms. Maslin added that Miss Allyson sounded ''like someone who has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen.''       
         Dorothy Uhnak, once famous as a 125-pound New York City Transit Authority policewoman who knocked down and arrested an armed mugger and then better known as the author of gritty, suspenseful, best-selling crime novels, died on Saturday in Greenport, N.Y. She was 76 and lived in Shelter Island, N.Y.         Her daughter, Tracy Uhnak, said she died of a deliberate drug overdose. She added that her mother had had a variety of accidents in recent years, was often depressed and had discussed suicide matter-of-factly.         ''You don't have to kill yourself today,'' she said more than once, her daughter recalled. ''You can do it tomorrow.''         Ms. Uhnak (pronounced YOU-nak) combined vibrant elements of her native New York, long experience as a police officer and a hard-boiled literary style that some compared to Hammett's or Chandler's in nine books of fiction and one of nonfiction.         Critics often cited the authenticity of scenes and characters in reviewing her crime novels ''Law and Order,'' ''Victims,'' the ''Christie Opara'' series -- and her first book, the semi-autobiographical ''Policewoman: A Young Woman's Initiation Into the Realities of Justice.'' She preceded Joseph Wambaugh as an ex-cop writing about the netherworld of crime and was a precursor of other women who have written about tough crime-fighting protagonists, including Marcia Muller, Sue Grafton and Patricia Cornwell. Her work was translated into 15 languages and was particularly popular in France.         ''I write about very hard situations and in a strong way,'' Ms. Uhnak said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977. Carol Cleveland, in The St. James Guide to Crime and Mystery Writers, noted her ''copious, pounding style that forces the reader to be involved.''         Ms. Uhnak was born Dorothy Goldstein next door to the 46th precinct on Ryer Avenue in the Bronx on April 24, 1930. Her novel ''The Ryer Avenue Story'' (1993), a murder mystery with a horrifying twist, roams her old neighborhood.         She was a tomboy who liked to hang out at the precinct and help with typing. She lamented to Newsday in a 1964 interview that she was ''always chased out when something interesting happened.''         She attended City College, then joined the transit police. She won two awards for bravery, but sometimes had an unusual perspective on people she arrested. She gave $125 she had won on a television quiz show to the pregnant wife of the large armed man who had attacked her.         ''I wondered what it feels like, how a criminal tells his family what he's done,'' she said to Newsday. ''I felt so sorry for him when I saw his family.''         After 14 years with the transit force, 12 of them as a detective, she resigned to complete her college education at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She also suggested that she left police work because of sex discrimination. ''Policewoman'' was published in 1964, after several editors recognized the woman who had pestered them with submissions as the name in the news.         Her first novel, ''The Bait,'' won the Edgar Award as the best first mystery novel of 1968 and introduced Detective Second Grade Christie Opara, who starred in Ms. Uhnak's next two novels, ''The Witness'' (1969) and ''The Ledger'' (1970).         She jettisoned the series after the editor Michael Korda at Simon & Schuster approached her to write a big police novel, modeled on ''The Godfather,'' Mario Puzo's blockbuster. The result was ''Law and Order'' (1973), Ms. Uhnak's breakout book, about three generations of a police department family. It became a television movie in 1976.         Another of her big successes was ''The Investigation'' (1977), which was the basis for the 1987 television movie ''Kojak: The Price of Justice.'' It generated controversy because it seemed to exploit the real case of Alice Crimmins, who was convicted of murdering her two young children. Ms. Uhnak insisted that the heroine of her novel, Kitty, was entirely her own creation.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Kew Gardens, Queens, Ms. Uhnak is survived by her husband, Anthony, and a sister, Mary Ellis of Hartsdale, N.Y.         Though it was Ms. Uhnak's own alchemy that turned police duty into imaginative fiction, she sometimes gave part of the credit to the criminals she had met in the line of duty.         ''Once I arrested a character at a subway stop for indecent exposure, and through the years I'd come home and write endless short stories about him,'' she told The Times in 1981. ''He finally evolved as a rapist-murderer in my first novel.''         Correction:  July 26, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on July 12 about Dorothy Uhnak, the policewoman turned detective novelist, gave an incorrect given name for her surviving sister. She is Mildred Ellis, not Mary.       
         Mary Day, one of American ballet's most distinguished teachers and the longtime artistic director of the Washington Ballet, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 96.         The cause was heart failure, said Judith Keyserling, the Washington Ballet spokeswoman.         Unlike many directors of professional ballet troupes in the United States, Ms. Day was not a major choreographer, financial patron or even a former professional dancer.         Yet when she and her own teacher, Lisa Gardiner, founded the Washington School of Ballet in 1944 and then a small performing group, she set in motion a pioneering career that had national and international impact.         That Ms. Day was doing something more than right was spectacularly confirmed by the influx of her students into first-rank companies and by the prizes they won beginning in the 1970's in top international competitions in Moscow; Helsinki, Finland; Lausanne, Switzerland; and Varna, Bulgaria. Her fiercely devoted alumni range from Shirley MacLaine to Kevin McKenzie of American Ballet Theater.         Some trained with her for a few years but many, like Mr. McKenzie, studied with her since childhood.         ''To be a really good teacher, one has to truly want each person to learn and to want to touch each student,'' Ms. Day said.         Attracting pupils from throughout the country (Mr. McKenzie's mother brought him from Vermont), Ms. Day became a nationally recognized teacher. Through the Washington Ballet, a respected regional company of some 20 dancers, she introduced Washington to an adventuresome repertory of old and new works.         Although guest stars passed through, the Washington Ballet until Ms. Day's retirement as artistic director in 1999, was essentially a showcase for young talent.         Among Ms. Day's other students were Amanda McKerrow of Ballet Theater, Virginia Johnson of Dance Theater of Harlem, Patrick Corbin of the Joffrey Ballet and the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Mimi Paul of New York City Ballet, Marianna Tcherkassky of Ballet Theater and Bonnie Moore of Ballet Theater and the Royal Ballet. Mr. McKenzie danced with the Joffrey before becoming one of Ballet Theater's danseurs nobles.         A teacher at heart, Ms. Day was resigned to seeing her most talented pupils leave her company for wider horizons. Ms. McKerrow was a teenager in the Washington Ballet when she made international headlines by winning a gold medal at the 1981 Moscow International Ballet Competition.         Shortly afterward, Ms. Day said: ''Amanda is due to be a very prominent ballerina in this next generation. She'll probably be here at Washington Ballet for a while. But we want what's best for her.''         The departure of her best students might have kept the Washington Ballet at the level of a regional company, no matter how admired. Yet the company established a strong presence in Washington, anything but a dance town until the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was built and could present international-level troupes.         Mary Day was born on Jan. 25, 1910, in Washington, where she studied with Ms. Gardiner, who had danced with Anna Pavlova's company. After founding the Washington School of Ballet in 1944, both women presented their students in children's ballets, often with the National Symphony Orchestra. Ms. Gardiner had called her small performing group the Washington Ballet, a title that was retained when the troupe was reorganized and Ms. Gardiner became artistic adviser in 1956. She died in 1958.         Ms. Day, whose drive to establish ballet in Washington was accompanied by a brisk elegance, then directed the small company with Frederic Franklin, a star of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. When Mr. Franklin left in 1961 to form a new company, the National Ballet, in Washington, Ms. Day shifted her attention to her school, adding an academic wing.         The National Ballet folded in 1974, and Ms. Day reorganized the Washington Ballet as a professional company in 1976. She was artistic director from 1976 to 1999, when she was succeeded by Septime Webre, the current director. She retired as director of the school in 2003.         The clarity and musicality that Ms. Day favored as a teacher were reflected in the uncluttered look of the repertory and performances of the Washington Ballet. This was especially true when the company's profile was strongly influenced by the dynamic plotless works of Choo San Goh, from Singapore, the company's resident choreographer from 1976 until his death in 1987. In the years afterward, Ms. Day and Elvi Moore, then the Washington Ballet's general director, encouraged company members and new choreographers to create works for their dancers.         Ms. Day leaves no immediate survivors.         Ms. Day's most popular production was her 1961 version of ''The Nutcracker,'' infused with vivid and cozy charm. Daughters of American presidents, including Chelsea Clinton and Caroline Kennedy, passed through the Washington School of Ballet, and Ms. Clinton had a small role in ''The Nutcracker.''         As for Ms. MacLaine, who grew up in the Washington area, she once thanked her beloved teacher at a benefit performance for recognizing her lack of talent and not encouraging her to go into ballet.       
         Cora T. Walker, a prominent New York lawyer who nearly 60 years ago became one of the first black women to practice law in the state, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, said her son Lawrence R. Bailey Jr., a lawyer, who practiced with his mother for many years.         For decades, Ms. Walker ran a private practice in Harlem, first on 125th Street and later from a restored brownstone at 270 Lenox Avenue. From 1976 until her retirement in 1999, she was the senior partner in Walker & Bailey, one of the city's few black law firms, which she established with her son.         The firm's practice eventually included corporate clients like Conrail, the Ford Motor Company, Texas Instruments and Kentucky Fried Chicken. But Ms. Walker continued drawing up wills and preparing personal-injury claims for the men and women she described as the ''plain, ordinary, not elegant people'' of her Harlem community.         Active in Republican politics, Ms. Walker ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Senate in 1958 and 1964. In 1970, The New York Times included her -- the only woman -- on a list of the most powerful leaders in Harlem.         Cora Thomasina Walker was born on June 20, 1922, in Charlotte, N.C., one of nine children of William and Benetta Jones Walker. The family moved to the Bronx when she was a child. When she was an adolescent, her parents separated, leaving her, her mother and her siblings dependent on public assistance.         After graduating from James Monroe High School in the Bronx, Ms. Walker promptly informed the Welfare Department that their help was no longer required: she would support the family. She took a night job as a teletype operator with Western Union and also sold Christmas cards.         At the same time, Ms. Walker was enrolled at St. John's University, then in Brooklyn, in a special six-year program in which students earned both a bachelor's degree and a law degree. She received a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. John's in 1945 and a law degree the next year.         For much of her career, Ms. Walker was active in the National Bar Association, a historically black organization. She helped found the association's Corporate Counsel Conference, an annual meeting sponsored by its commercial law section. Begun in 1988, the conference helps black lawyers cultivate relationships with corporate clients.         In the 1960's, Ms. Walker became the first woman to serve as president of the Harlem Lawyers Association.         Ms. Walker's marriage, to Lawrence R. Bailey Sr., a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to her son Lawrence Jr., of the Bronx, she is survived by another son, Bruce E. Bailey, a physician, of Norwich, Conn.; a sister, Danetta Black, formerly of White Plains; and three grandchildren.         In 1947, when Ms. Walker was admitted to the New York bar, she found the doors of the city's law firms tightly shut. (One firm relented and offered her a position -- as a secretary.) So she struck out on her own.         Her first client was an undertaker, for whom she did collections. Before long, by dint of reading self-improvement books, Ms. Walker had learned to ''join everything, give everybody a card, join a political club,'' as she told The New York Times in 1989.         In 1999, the New York County Lawyers' Association installed a plaque outside the Lenox Avenue brownstone where Ms. Walker had her office, commemorating her half-century in the law. The building has since been sold, her son said, and the plaque is now gone.       
         Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German-born soprano whose interpretations of Strauss and Mozart made her one of the most dazzling artists of her time, died yesterday at her home in Austria. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Austrian state television. Citing a funeral home director, the broadcaster, ORF, said Miss Schwarzkopf had died in the town of Schruns in Austria's westernmost province, Vorarlberg. No cause of death was given.         To her legions of admirers, Miss Schwarzkopf was a peerless interpreter of Strauss's Marschallin, Mozart's Donna Elvira and other operatic roles. But her image was tarnished in her later years by revelations that she had lied about the extent of her association with the Nazis during World War II.         Not only had she performed for the Nazis, it was learned, but she had also been a member of the party. In her defense, she said that for an artist needing work, joining the party had been ''akin to joining a union.''         For a singer of such unquestionable stature, Miss Schwarzkopf's work was controversial. In her prime, she possessed a radiant lyric soprano voice, impressive technical agility and exceptional understanding of style. From the 1950's until the 1970's, she was for many listeners the high priestess of the lieder recital, a sublime artist who brought textual nuance, interpretive subtlety and elegant musicianship to her work.         But others found her interpretations calculated, mannered and arch (the ''Prussian perfectionist,'' one critic called her), and complained that in trying to add textual vitality, Miss Schwarzkopf resorted to crooning and half-spoken dramatic effects.         Connoisseurs and critics could be surprisingly divided about her basic vocal gifts.         Will Crutchfield, reviewing some live recordings of Miss Schwarzkopf in recital, wrote in The New York Times in 1990: ''It was always clear that she had a superior voice (a smooth, glamorous lyric soprano) and superior technical command.'' Yet Peter G. Davis, writing in The Times in 1981, described her career as ''a triumph of intelligence and willpower over what was basically an unremarkable voice.''         The consensus, however, was that in roles like the Marschallin and other Strauss heroines (Ariadne in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' the countess in ''Capriccio''), as well as Mozart's Fiordiligi and Countess Almaviva and Wagner's Eva and Elsa, she could sing incomparably, with shimmering tone and richness and charismatic presence.         She was an uncommonly beautiful woman, despite a visible gap between her two front teeth that she never bothered to correct, with light hair and deep-set gray eyes. For a time in her younger years she pursued a career as a film actress and might have succeeded had she continued.         A hard-working, self-challenging singer, she performed 74 roles in 53 operas, including Anne Trulove in the world premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress'' in Venice in 1951. Her lieder repertory included hundreds of songs by Schubert, Schumann, Mozart and Strauss, and she was a pioneering champion of the songs of Hugo Wolf, which she sang with insight and affecting beauty.         Olga Maria Elisabeth Frederike Schwarzkopf was born on Dec. 9, 1915, in Jarotschin, Germany, in what is now west-central Poland. Both her parents were Prussian. Friedrich Schwarzkopf, her father, a classics schoolmaster, was an easygoing intellectual. Her mother, the former Elisabeth Frohling, was an efficient homemaker who took charge of her adored only child's education and budding musical career.         Friedrich Schwarzkopf's work as a teacher necessitated that the family move several times. When Elisabeth was 13, they settled in Magdeburg, Germany, where she studied piano, guitar, viola and organ and developed a naturally high, light voice that kept her in demand for concerts at school and local amateur performances.         The family moved to Berlin in 1933, the year Hitler came to power. Miss Schwarzkopf attended the Berlin Royal Augusta School and later won admission to the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. In 1934, before beginning her formal training, she won a grant from the League of National Socialist Students for a cycling and camping trip to England, where she learned English. She retained a fondness for the country, which after the war embraced her as an artist and made her a Dame of the British Empire in 1992.         At the music school, students were required to attend daily lectures on Hitler's National Socialist movement, and in 1935, when she was nearly 20, Miss Schwarzkopf joined the student association of the National Socialist Party. Alan Jefferson, a Schwarzkopf biographer, said she became f√ºhrerin of the student organization and that one of her responsibilities as ideological leader was to ''keep an eye on other students.''         Her teacher at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, though distinguished in her field, inexplicably believed that Miss Schwarzkopf should be a contralto. It was not until after her formal training, in 1938, when she began singing with the Berlin State Opera, that Miss Schwarzkopf came into her own vocally.         During this time she gained a reputation as a singer fiercely determined to leap from the small roles typically assigned a newcomer into substantive parts. The director of the company, Wilhelm Rode, had won the favor of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One reason Miss Schwarzkopf later gave for cooperating with the Nazis was that it was incumbent on aspiring singers in the company to support the party.         But until the 1980's, she maintained that she had never officially joined the Nazi Party. She denied having done so in three Allied questionnaires in 1945, a time during the occupation when former party members were usually barred from public performance in Germany.         In 1982, however, a music historian at the University of Vienna, Oliver Rathkolb, published a doctoral dissertation that revealed details of her party membership. The information had come from documents discovered in the Allied Denazification Bureau in Vienna and subsequently moved to the National Archives in Washington.         According to these records, Miss Schwarzkopf applied for membership on Jan. 26, 1940, and was accepted on March 1 of that year, becoming Nazi member No. 7548960. Scholars and authors have since placed her application for party membership even earlier.         In an interview with The Times in 1983, Miss Schwarzkopf denied she had been a party member. But when told of these documents by The Times, she admitted that she had joined the party. ''We thought nothing of it,'' she said. ''We just did it.'' In a letter to The Times, she expanded on her explanation: ''It was akin to joining a union, and exactly for the same reason: to have a job.''         In other interviews, she quoted in her defense the first line of Tosca's famous aria: ''Vissi d'arte,'' which translates, ''I lived for art.''         Discussion of her Nazi past re-emerged briefly in connection with tributes to her on her 80th birthday. Mr. Jefferson's biography, ''Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,'' which came out at the time, raised debate about her wartime role, depicting her as an ambitious singer who was focused on furthering her career.         As a Nazi, Miss Schwarzkopf gave performances at party functions and sang for Waffen SS troops at the front. Some researchers believe she became a member of Goebbels's Reichstheaterkammer, working in the propaganda ministry and appearing insome films.         Still, if she had hoped that party affiliation would quickly advance her career at the Berlin State Opera, it did not work as planned. She was still expected to sing, sometimes nightly, bit roles in ''Carmen,'' ''Die Fledermaus'' and frothy operettas.         Her breakthrough came with the dauntingly difficult coloratura role of Zerbinetta in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' which she first sang in late 1940. Her performance won the attention of Maria Ivog√ºn, a noted exponent of the role. Miss Ivog√ºn was so impressed, she took on Miss Schwarzkopf as a private student, coaching her in the high soprano repertory, and training her as a lieder singer. Miss Schwarzkopf was soon engaged by the Vienna State Opera.         She realized that her future lay with the lyric soprano repertory. Engagements followed at the first postwar Salzburg Festival in 1947, where she worked with the conductor Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, and in subsequent summers, when she formed a close working relationship with the conductor Herbert von Karajan. She also toured with the Vienna State Opera in 1947, traveling to London, where she performed in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Fidelio'' at Covent Garden.         The London performances were an enormous success, and she was invited to join the newly founded Covent Garden company. She sang with the company for the next five years, performing not just her German repertory but also Violetta, Mimi, Gilda, and Massenet's Manon, all in English.         Her career and repertory choices were now being shaped by Walter Legge, then a music administrator and critic. Born in London in 1906, Legge had no formal training in music but was musically astute. He had been an assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham and was largely responsible for forming the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus.         After the war, Legge worked mainly for recording companies. It was during a scouting trip to Vienna in search of new talent for EMI Records that the severe-looking, bespectacled Legge first heard Miss Schwarzkopf in an audition. Thus began an artistic partnership that grew into a life partnership. Legge, then divorced from his first wife, Nancy Evans, a mezzo-soprano, married Miss Schwarzkopf in 1953.         Opinion is divided about the effect Legge had on Miss Schwarzkopf as an artist. He tended to treat her as a musical and intellectual inferior. He was capable of berating her in public when she failed to meet his approval.         But he introduced her to a wealth of repertory, especially the songs of Hugo Wolf, and as artistic director of EMI Records, he supervised her recordings, coaching her in detail and ensuring that the engineers captured her voice at its best. Given Miss Schwarzkopf's association with the Nazis, there was some trepidation about launching her American career. Her debut in the United States was delayed until October 1953, but that performance, a single sold-out song recital at Town Hall in New York, captivated the critics.         This was followed in late 1954 by an American tour, which ended back at Town Hall. A critic for Musical America wrote that Miss Schwarzkopf's singing at Town Hall had ''displayed the exquisite finish, technical mastery and interpretive felicity that had marked her debut recital here last season.''         In the fall of 1956 she sang a recital at Carnegie Hall. It was the first time the hall had ever been sold out for a program of German lieder.         Miss Schwarzkopf's American operatic debut came in 1955 with the San Francisco Opera as the Marschallin. Mildred Norton, a critic for The Saturday Review, reported that a capacity audience had saluted a ''memorable new Princess Werdenberg.'' Miss Schwarzkopf, she wrote, was ''a poised and vibrant new personality with a vocal radiance and a personal grace.''         Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera did not occur until October 1964, again as the Marschallin. Though Raymond Erickson, a critic for The Times, noted less freshness and bloom in Miss Schwarzkopf's voice (she was nearly 49), he said she had ''conquered her listeners, and the roar that filled the house when she took her bows must be the kind that the most vain prima donna could ask for.''         Outside the Metropolitan Opera House, there were scattered protests over her wartime career, and Miss Schwarzkopf had a chilly relationship with the Met's general manager Rudolf Bing, an Austrian-born Jew. Besides her six performances of the Marschallin that debut season, she sang only one more time at the Met, a Donna Elvira in 1966.         But she performed frequently in New York in recital and with orchestras and continued to win devoted admirers around the world. Many of her EMI recordings became immediate classics. Among them were her Mozart song album with the pianist Walter Gieseking and her Schubert song album with the pianist Edwin Fischer, both recorded in 1952; her 1957 recording of ''Rosenkavalier,'' conducted by Karajan, and, one of her finest achievements, her 1959 recording of ''Capriccio,'' conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.         As her career slowed, she began giving master classes, usually teaming with Legge, gaining a reputation as an insightful but almost impossibly exacting coach. In 1977-78, she embarked on a swan song recital tour, mostly accompanied by the pianist Geoffrey Parsons, who was her partner for her official farewell recital in Zurich on March 19, 1979. Two days later, Legge, who had become embittered that his talents were no longer sought by recording companies, died of a heart attack at 72.         Miss Schwarzkopf leaves no immediate survivors. Asked once whether she regretted having had no children, she replied, ''I have 500 children, the songs I sing.''         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A photograph with an obituary yesterday about the renowned soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who died Thursday in Austria at age 90, was published in error. The picture, supplied by the Salzburg Festival, showed Anneliese Rothenberger, not Miss Schwarzkopf, in the role of Sophie from a 1962 film adaptation of Richard Strauss's opera ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' Miss Schwarzkopf played the Marschallin in that production, which the festival had staged for the film. The Marschallin was a signature role for Miss Schwarzkopf, who performed it, above, in 1959 at Covent Garden in London.         (Photo by Evening Standard/Getty Images)         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was published in error. It showed Anneliese Rothenberger -- not Miss Schwarzkopf -- in the role of Sophie from ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' a 1962 film adaptation of the Richard Strauss opera. The Salzburg Festival mounted that production, in which Miss Schwarzkopf had the role of the Marschallin, and originally distributed the photograph with the incorrect information. A picture of Miss Schwarzkopf appears today on Page C10.         The obituary also misspelled the surname of a music critic for The New York Times who reviewed Miss Schwarzkopf's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1964. He was Raymond Ericson, not Erickson.         Correction:  August 10, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Friday of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf referred incorrectly to her birthplace in some copies. When she was born in 1915, the town was Jarotschin, Germany, not Jarocin, and it was not ''near Poland;'' Poland did not exist then as an independent nation. Since 1918 the town has been Jarocin, Poland.       
         Lydia, Duchess of Bedford, an English aristocrat who helped transform Woburn Abbey, her second husband's ancestral home in Bedfordshire, into a pioneering and satisfyingly lucrative example of blueblood tourism, died July 25 in Chertsey, Surrey, England. She was 88.         Her death came after she was injured in a fall, said Paul de Fraine, personal assistant to the present duke.         After inheriting Woburn Abbey in 1953, with its staggering estate taxes and annual heating bills of $14,000, Ian Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford, a former newspaper reporter and rent collector, decided to make the dilapidated property pay for itself by reinventing it as a tourist attraction. It was not easy; half the building had been demolished because of dry rot.         The estate, with more than 10,000 acres of land, had been in the Russell family since 1547, and when the new duke and duchess, who had been farming in South Africa, were called home to do their dynastic duty, they literally rolled up their sleeves and washed antique porcelain dinner services and dusted off the paintings by Canaletto, Landseer and Van Dyck.         Six months of cleaning later, Woburn Abbey's doors were opened to the public in 1954. The entrance fee was a half-crown, about 35 cents; it is now ¬£10.50, about $20.         Some of the couple's noble friends were horrified at additions that they considered shocking intrusions of show business: in addition to snack bars and sailboat rentals, there was a children's zoo with a skunk named Jasmine. More startling stunts were to come. The property eventually developed a safari park with lions, giraffes and Barbary apes. Marilyn Monroe was invited to sleep in one of the historic beds.         However, many members of the nobility tried to follow the example of the duke and duchess when it became clear that the newly enlivened Woburn Abbey was a moneymaker.         In the first five months of 1957, according to an article in The New York Times, 373,000 tourists visited the property, paying more than $200,000 toward the upkeep of the estate.         The estate is now managed by the duke's grandson Andrew Russell, 15th Duke of Bedford. Today, it incorporates three award-winning golf courses, an inn, a stud farm, an antiques center and a restaurant housed in a Tudor-style half-timbered building that was displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.         Born in 1917 as the Hon. Lydia Yarde-Buller, the duchess was a member of a family whose genealogical tentacles connected her to an array of notables, including Sir Walter Raleigh, Robert E. Lee, Olivia de Havilland and President Benjamin Harrison. Her father, John Yarde-Buller, the third Baron Churston, was a military officer who served in the Boer War. Her mother, Jessie Smither, was one of Edwardian London's most alluring musical comedy stars, performing under the stage name Denise Orme. Adding further exotic gloss to the Yarde-Buller clan was the duchess's sister Joan, who married the playboy Prince Aly Khan, converted to Islam and adopted the name Princess Tajuldowlah.         The duchess married her first husband, Capt. Ian Archibald de Hoghton Lyle, heir to a baronetcy, in 1938; he was killed in action four years later. She married the Duke of Bedford in 1947, about a year after the suicide of his first wife, when he was still the Marquess of Tavistock. They divorced in 1960 because of the duke's affair with the French television producer Nicole Milinaire, who became his third and last wife.         Lydia, Duchess of Bedford (who kept her title after the divorce, with the customary addition of her first name to avoid confusion with her husband's new wife) is survived by two sons, Sir Gavin Lyle, third baronet, of Murthly, Perth, Scotland, and Lord Francis Russell of London; a daughter, Lorna Alexander of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland; a stepson, Lord Rudolf Russell, also of London; and nephews and nieces who include Aga Khan IV, the 49th imam of the Shiite Imami Ismaili Muslims, who lives in Paris.       
         Annely Juda, a London art dealer whose gallery, Annely Juda Fine Art, was known for its pioneering shows of early European modernists, died on Aug. 13 in London. She was 91.         Ms. Juda died after nearly a year of declining health, said Michael Michaeledes, an artist and friend of the family, who has exhibited with Ms. Juda's gallery since 1963.         In a gallery career that spanned five decades, Ms. Juda represented numerous contemporary artists, among them Anthony Caro, David Hockney, Leon Kossoff, Alan Charlton, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and Tadashi Kawamata. But she was especially known for her annual summer exhibitions, often titled ''The Non-Objective World,'' which helped reintroduce the work of the Russian avant-garde and of de Stijl and Bauhaus artists to the London art world and beyond; they often contained works rarely seen elsewhere. The 1981 summer show, for example, featured seven sculptures by the Russian Constructivist Vladimir Tatlin reconstructed from archival photographs by Martyn Chalk, a British sculptor.         Ms. Juda was born Anneliese Brauer in Kassel, Germany, in 1914. Her mother was a designer of clothing and typefaces, and her father was an industrial chemist with a keen interest in Goethe's theory of color. Ms. Juda began studying art history, but the family, which was Jewish, moved to Palestine shortly after Hitler came to power.         Three years later, she traveled to London, working in a boarding house for German refugees in lieu of paying rent while she studied art history and clothing design at the Reimann School. In 1939, she married Paul Juda, also German, and in 1949 she returned with her husband to Germany to try to reclaim his family's confiscated property.         In 1955, the couple separated and Ms. Juda took their three children to London, where she raised them alone, often by working several jobs at once. For two years she administered the Eric Estorick Collection, which immersed her in the art of the Italian Futurists.         In 1960 Ms. Juda opened the Molton Gallery with partners; it was followed in 1963 by the Hamilton Galleries, also with partners. In 1968, she joined forces with her son, David, to form Annely Juda Fine Art, inaugurating the gallery with her first summer exhibition of non-objective art. Ms. Juda was made a Companion of the Order of the British Empire in 1998.         In addition to her son, she is survived by two daughters, Carol Spund of Glasgow and Susan Habrovitsky of Fontenay-sous-Bois, France; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Andr√©e Ruellan, a noted painter of the 1930's and 40's whose complete body of work spans almost the entire 20th century, died on July 15 in Kingston, N.Y. She was 101 and lived for many years in Shady, N.Y., near Woodstock.         Her death was confirmed by a friend, Daniel Gelfand. Ms. Ruellan leaves no immediate survivors.         A child prodigy, Ms. Ruellan first exhibited her work at 9. As a young woman, she was known for her sympathetic depictions of scenes from ordinary life, which she observed on the streets of New York and in her travels in the American South.         Reviewing an exhibition of Ms. Ruellan's work in 1940, The New York Times called it ''light, fresh and largely in the true field of American genre,'' adding, ''it is never without strength and clarity.''         Last year, in honor of Ms. Ruellan's 100th birthday, a retrospective of her work was organized by the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, Ga. It is currently on view, through Aug. 27, at the Columbus Museum in Columbus, Ga.         Ms. Ruellan's work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art and elsewhere.         Andr√©e Ruellan (pronounced roo-ELL-en) was born in Manhattan on April 6, 1905, to parents who had come from France. Her father, Andr√©, was an aviator and airplane mechanic.         Ms. Ruellan began drawing early. In 1914, when she was 9, the Ashcan School painter Robert Henri invited her to join a group show in the East Village; she contributed watercolors and drawings of urban street life. That year she also had an illustration published in The Masses, a progressive magazine.         In 1920 Ms. Ruellan's father was killed in an airfield accident, and she began selling her work to support herself and her mother, Lucette. The same year she was awarded a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York, where she studied with the noted painter Maurice Sterne.         For much of the 1920's, she and her mother lived in Paris. There she met John W. Taylor, a painter, whom she married in 1929. Soon afterward, the couple moved to Shady, where they were for decades part of Woodstock's lively artists' colony. Mr. Taylor died in 1983.         During the Depression Ms. Ruellan and her husband made several trips to the South, which resulted in some of her most memorable work. Her paintings from the period are notable for their portrayals of ordinary African-Americans at work and at play.         ''Crap Game'' (1936), perhaps Ms. Ruellan's best-known painting, depicts a group of black men in Charleston, S.C., engaged in an avid game of dice. But the muted palette and the stark emptiness of the background convey the straitened circumstances of black life in the Depression-era South.         In later years Ms. Ruellan's work was more influenced by Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. But to the end of her career -- she continued to draw until she was well into her 80's -- she remained a Realist, committed to the idea that art should represent solid, flesh-and-blood humanity.         ''People are never just spots of color,'' Ms. Ruellan told American Artist magazine in 1943. ''What moves me most is that in spite of poverty and the constant struggle for existence, so much kindness and sturdy courage remain. Naturally I want to paint well-designed pictures -- but I also wish to convey these warmer human emotions.''       
         Gay Delanghe, a modern-dance choreographer and performer whose work was staged in New York in the 1960's and 70's and who became an influential teacher, died on Aug. 1 in Ann Arbor, Mich. She was 65.         The cause was ovarian cancer, according to Peter Sparling, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Delanghe was known for her authoritative, witty dancing in performances of her own work and with choreographers including Lucas Hoving and Yvonne Rainer. A lead dancer in Hoving's troupe, she staged his pieces for companies and college dance departments for 20 years. Her dances, presented in the 1960's and 70's at New York theaters including the Cubiculo and Dance Theater Workshop, had something of the same quality.         ''There is a slightly loony streak running through Gay Delanghe's choreography that gives it special distinction,'' Don McDonagh wrote in The New York Times in 1973. ''She manages to be earnest and flighty, humorous and dead serious, strict and permissive by unexpected turns.''         Born in Detroit, Ms. Delanghe trained in dance at the University of Michigan before moving on to New York City and a dance career that included teaching at Barnard College and the American Dance Festival. She returned to the University of Michigan in 1974 as a faculty member in the newly formed dance department and became a central figure in the development of modern dance in Michigan over four decades.         Ms. Delanghe is survived by her mother, Lenore Delanghe of Clinton Township, Mich.       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         The cause was complications of esophageal cancer, a family spokeswoman, Cathy Bonner, said. Ms. Bonner said the illness was diagnosed in March.         A champion of civil rights for minorities, women and gay men and lesbians, Ms. Richards first ran for governor in 1990 calling for a ''New Texas'' that would offer more opportunity and power to those groups.         She went on to become one of the most effective in a long line of Texas progressives who vied for control of the state when it was largely a Democratic stronghold. But her defeat after one term was a strong signal that generations of Democratic dominance in Texas had ended.         If one Mr. Bush closed out her political career, another figured into her rise, as a target of her barbs. ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her saucy, plain-spoken keynote address, borrowing from the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory, was one of the year's political highlights. ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said at one point.         The speech transformed her, then the Texas treasurer, into a national figure. And it made her, a mother of four, an admired champion of feminism. ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,'' she told the national audience. ''She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         Her defeat in 1994, coming in a year of sweeping Republican success at the polls nationwide, did not dim her celebrity on the national stage. She continued to speak out on behalf of liberal causes, was a regular commentator on CNN and appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips.         She also went to work as a senior adviser for the international law firm of Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper) and later for the public relations company Public Strategies. She also served on numerous boards of directors, including those of J. C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, an only child, in Lakeview, Tex. She graduated in 1950 from Waco High School, where she showed a special facility for debate and met her future husband, David Richards. In her junior year, she attended the Girls State mock government program in Austin and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girls Nation in Washington.         Ms. Richards went on to enroll at Baylor University in Waco on a debate scholarship and married. After graduating, she and Mr. Richards moved to Austin, where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School. She reared her four children -- Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen -- in Austin, and they were with her at home when she died, Ms. Bonner said.         Ms. Richards is also survived by eight grandchildren. Cecile Richards, who became president of Planned Parenthood this year, lives in New York; the other siblings live in Austin.         As a young woman, Ann Richards volunteered in several campaigns for governor: in 1958 for Henry B. Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough. She then helped Mr. Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In the early 1960's, she and a handful of other young Democrats founded North Dallas Democratic Women in an effort to give more power to women in the party. ''The regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who looked on women as little more than machine parts,'' she said later.         In 1972, she ran her first campaign, helping elect to the Texas Legislature Sarah Weddington, who had successfully argued Roe v. Wade before the United States Supreme Court.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin. She held the job for four years. She also began drinking heavily, becoming alcoholic and putting great strain on her marriage, she said later. The marriage ended in divorce.         After entering rehabilitation, she stopped drinking in 1980 and later said that the decision to seek help had saved her life and salvaged her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer and received the most votes of any statewide candidate, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years. She was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when Gov. William P. Clements Jr., the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, decided not to run for re-election, Ms. Richards challenged a former governor, Mark White, in the Democratic primary and won. She went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, in the general election after a brutal campaign.         As governor, among other achievements, she fulfilled her campaign promise to bring more blacks, Hispanics and women into public office. She appointed the first black regent to the University of Texas and installed the first blacks and women on the state's legendary police force, the Texas Rangers. She also pushed for tougher penalties for polluters and gained control of the state's insurance board in a drive to reduce the industry's influence over state government.         Ms. Richards oversaw an expansion of the state's prison system, increasing the space for prisoners by a third, and cracked down on the number of prisoners being paroled. She also instituted a major substance abuse program for prisoners and championed creation of the Texas lottery as a source of public school financing. She bought the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         The same year, she was named chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, which nominated Bill Clinton for president for the first time.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, George W. Bush, going so far as to refer to him as ''some jerk.'' The comment drew considerable criticism. She later acknowledged that Mr. Bush had been more effective than she at ''staying on message'' and that he had made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten 53 percent to 46 percent.         Ms. Richards was a co-author of several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' (Simon & Schuster, 1989), with Peter Knobler, and ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis'' (Dutton, 2003), with Richard U. Levine, a doctor.         On her 60th birthday, she got a motorcycle license, an event that was commemorated in a cover photo in Texas Monthly showing Ms. Richards's head superimposed on the body of a woman in a fringed jacket atop a Harley-Davidson beneath the headline ''White Hot Mama.''         In recent years, Ms. Richards had worked to establish the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, a public college preparatory school in Austin. It will open next year, giving priority to economically disadvantaged students. She was also a sought-after commentator and speaker whose observations had lost little of their tart humor since her national emergence two decades ago.         As she once explained, ''I learned early on that people liked you if you made them laugh.''         Correction:  September 16, 2006, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of Ann W. Richards, the former Texas governor, misstated the year she gave the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was 1988, not 1998.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 82 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Poised as a princess, athletic and lithe, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former Ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         Patricia Kennedy's 1954 marriage to Mr. Lawford was the stuff of newsreels; some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.         The sixth of nine children born to Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald, Mrs. Lawford, like her siblings, had a well-honed understanding of politics and of the power of appearances. As early as 1946, she campaigned for her brother John during his first run for Congress, organizing highly effective women's coffees in Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods, and when he ran for President in 1960 she often substituted at events for his pregnant wife, Jacqueline Kennedy.         The Lawfords strengthened John F. Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with ''The Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was close friends with Marilyn Monroe, Tennesee Williams, and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce. It was a highly publicized break, one that required Mrs. Lawford to establish residency in Idaho in order to circumvent New York's divorce laws of the time.         Afterward, Mrs. Lawford and her four children moved to New York, where she took on a busy social schedule, befriended artists and writers and became known as a generous benefactor of the arts. She was a familiar presence at benefit dinners and her patronage would increase the cachet of any fund-raising charity event. Her name still regularly appeared in the society columns of Palm Beach, New York and the Hamptons, where she maintained a residence.         Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives. Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well-rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother. She was an accomplished athlete but unlike her ambitious siblings, she never caught the family's legendary fire for competition.         In her book 1987 book, ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote that Rose Kennedy was bothered by Patricia's lack of ambition. ''Although she had a good mind, a fine physique and a beautiful face which could easily have led her to excel in school, in sports or in appearance, Rose contended 'she would never make the effort to achieve distinction' in any of these areas.''         Much like her older sister, Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to raise their childen as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York. She and Mr. Lawford settled into a sprawling mansion in Malibu that was once owned by Louis B. Mayer. The house became a recreation center for other family members, and the President would spend time lounging at his sister's pool when he was on the West Coast.         After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, she was often seen in the company of his widow and their two children. As recently as 1986, she joined Senator Kennedy on an official visit to Chile that was marred by egg-throwing protestors angered by Mr. Kennedy's criticism of President Augusto Pinochet.         She devoted her energies to organizations that served the mentally disabled and those helping people with substance abuse problems. She had a close personal appreciation for both causes: her older sister Rosemary was born mildly retarded and was lobotomized at 23, and she, Mr. Lawford and her son Christopher had waged their own battles with drugs and alcohol.         Her brother Robert, the former attorney general and later senator from New York, was closest to her in age, just 18 months younger. After his assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lawford assembled a privately printed book of reminiscences about him, as John had done before about the oldest brother, Joe, who died in World War II.         Her book, ''That Shining Hour,'' was published in 1969. In her introduction, she wrote ''This is not a sad book. Bobby was not a sad person. His basic shyness to the outside world gave way to fun, humor and wit whenever he was with the family.''         In addition to her brother Edward and her three sisters, Jean Kennedy Smith, Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Rosemary Kennedy, Mrs. Lawford is survived by her son, Christopher, of New York, and three daughters, Sydney, of Washington, Robin, of New York, and Victoria Frances, of Washington, and 10 grandchildren.         Correction:  September 19, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about Patricia Kennedy Lawford, a sister of President John F. Kennedy, misstated the location of her death. It was at her home in Manhattan, not her home in Southampton, N.Y. The article also erroneously included a survivor; her sister Rosemary Kennedy died last year. The obituary also misstated the place of residence of Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher. He lives in California, not New York. A full obituary appears today on page B8.       
         Margaret Phipps Boegner, who opened her family's vast Long Island estate, Old Westbury Gardens, to the public, died on Saturday at her home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 99.         Her death was announced by the gardens, of which she was founder and former chairwoman.         Mrs. Boegner was the granddaughter of Henry Phipps, who in 1861 joined his friend Andrew Carnegie in the steel venture that became a core part of the United States Steel Corporation at its founding in 1901. Mrs. Boegner was the daughter of John S. Phipps and of Margarita Grace Phipps, whose family started the Grace Shipping Line.         In 1905, John and Margarita Phipps built an English Restoration-style manor house on 160 acres along Old Westbury Road in central Nassau County. The area, which had been the site of Quaker farms, was by then dotted by imposing country estates. Seventy acres of the Phipps estate were set aside for precisely sculptured and varied gardens.         Mrs. Boegner's mother died in 1957, and her father died in 1958. A year later, Mrs. Boegner -- who by then lived in a somewhat more modest white clapboard home adjacent to the estate -- established and became chairwoman of the nonprofit Old Westbury Gardens. Since then, the public has been allowed to roam the gardens and take tours of the manor house, which is furnished with 18th-century antiques.         Circular rose gardens, a rainbow of blossoms surrounding a thatched cottage and an Italianate walled garden with trees trained to grow in the shape of candelabras are found near the main house. There are grand vistas down rows of linden and beech trees. And the far reaches of the estate, with lakes and ponds, evoke 18th-century English landscapes.         Margaret Helen Phipps Boegner, who preferred to be called Peggie, was born on Nov. 17, 1906. A year later, the family moved to Old Westbury. Mrs. Boegner lived in the main house until 1930, when she married J. Gordon Douglas Jr. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. In 1951, she married Etienne Boegner, a French diplomat. Mr. Boegner died in 1985.         Mrs. Boegner is survived by a daughter, Dita Douglas Naylor-Leyland of Manhattan; a son, J. Gordon Douglas III of Pawling, N.Y.; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan.

Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Athletic, lithe and as poised as a princess, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         The marriage, in 1954, was the stuff of newsreels: some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.

The Lawfords strengthened John Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with the ''Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Mr. Sinatra threw his support behind Kennedy, and his hit song ''High Hopes,'' with lyrics by Sammy Cahn, became the Kennedy campaign song. At the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, Mr. Lawford and Ms. MacLaine helped lead the singing of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce.

Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives.         In the 1930's, while her father was ambassador to Britain, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, a boarding school for girls on the outskirts of London. When her family moved to Bronxville, N.Y., she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school in the Maplehurst section of the Bronx. (It later moved to Greenwich, Conn.) She attended Rosemont College in Pennsylvania, graduating in 1945.         Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother.

But Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher Lawford, wrote in his best-selling memoir, ''Symptoms of Withdrawal,'' published last year, that his mother had been resentful of her father for ''not being allowed fully to live up to her potential.''         In college she directed and acted in theater productions, and she pursued those interests after graduation, going to work as an assistant in the New York production department of NBC. She moved to Los Angeles to work as an assistant for Kate Smith's radio show and later for ''Family Theater,'' the radio program produced by the Rev. Patrick Peyton.         Much like her older sister Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to rear their children as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York.

In her last years, Mrs. Lawford led a relatively private life. She may have been a Kennedy, a woman with an instantly familiar name, but she did not crave attention and enjoyed walking the streets of Manhattan without being recognized.

         Beth Levine, an innovative American shoe designer whose boots, as Nancy Sinatra sang while wearing them, were made for walking, died on Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was lung cancer, said her niece, Nan Bush, the wife and producing partner of the photographer Bruce Weber.         Mrs. Levine designed shoes for 30 years under the label Herbert Levine, named for her husband, and was known as America's First Lady of Shoe Design because of her prominence in 20th-century fashion, and because her designs were worn by the American first ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy.         She made shoes for Barbra Streisand in ''Funny Girl'' and the white stiletto boots worn by Nancy Sinatra to sing ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.'' Mrs. Levine had reignited a trend for boots in the 1960's with her stretchy stocking styles and vinyl Go-Go boots, designed for dancing, (or walking all over you). When Ms. Sinatra released her anthem of women's empowerment in 1966, she was shown in film made for early video jukeboxes wearing the style from Herbert Levine. The song increased the demand for fashion boots so much that Saks Fifth Avenue opened a corner in its shoe department called Beth's Bootery.         ''She was among the most influential shoe designers of the century,'' said Elizabeth Semmelhack, the chief curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, who included Mrs. Levine in an exhibition this year called ''Icons of Elegance.''         ''In looking at 20th-century shoe design, she was in many ways a maverick mind,'' Ms. Semmelhack said. ''She saw the possibilities in all sorts of new materials and different ways of making a shoe.''         Mrs. Levine's designs were known for their poetic whimsy: She lined a sandal with an insole of Astroturf and affixed a plastic flower to its toe straps, and she designed heels made of rolled leather or silver thread that looked like a spool.         One of Mrs. Levine's most fanciful ideas, though it did not catch on, was the ''upper-less shoe,'' which was merely the sole of a high-heeled shoe with an adhesive insole that attached to the bottom of the foot. Her most outrageous designs -- driving shoes made to look like race cars, elaborately carved wooden blocks that looked like birds in flight and evening shoes that looked like Aladdin's lamp -- were included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1976, when she and her husband retired.         Beth Katz Levine was born on Dec. 31, 1914, in Patchogue, N.Y., the third of five children of Anna and Israel Katz, Lithuanian immigrants who operated a dairy farm. In the 1930's, she moved to Manhattan and found work as a shoe model (her feet were size 4B), then worked her way up from a stylist to head designer for I. Miller.         After working for the Red Cross in World War II, she applied for a job in 1944 designing shoes for another shoe manufacturer. She met Herbert Levine, who was running that company, and married him three months later.         Mr. Levine died in 1991. Mrs. Levine is survived by a daughter, Anna Thomson-Wilson, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Levine once said: ''My mother always thought a fine pair of shoes was a necessity. And my father dealt with horses and cows, so I knew about leather.''         In 1948, the couple started a business under the name Herbert Levine. Mrs. Levine wrote in a letter to the Bata Shoe Museum this year: ''We wanted to create a shoemaking niche. We were making very pretty shoes that nobody needed, but everybody wanted.''         Mrs. Levine was given the Coty Award in 1967, for design innovations that overcame traditional boundaries of footwear. In the 1950's, European designers had created a demand for mules, but they were difficult for women to walk in without crunching their toes to keep them on. Mrs. Levine's solution was a strip of elastic that caused the heel of the mule to flip upward as a woman walked, maintaining the tension between the ball of the foot and the heel. She called her invention the Spring-O-Later.         ''Clothes designers have gravity on their side,'' Mrs. Levine said. ''But shoe designers work upside down. Ideas are easy to come by. Getting them realized is something else.''         Although she worked closely with fashion designers to create shoes that would match their clothes, including a regular collaboration with James Galanos, Mrs. Levine was often a vocal critic of their work. Even after her retirement, she would call the designer Helmut Lang after his show to tell him what she liked and what she did not.         Ms. Bush once recalled introducing her aunt to Gianni Versace at a restaurant. ''The first thing she said was: 'You should be ashamed of yourself. Some of those clothes you make are really degrading to women,' '' Ms. Bush said. ''But by the end of the night, they were friends.''       
         H√©l√®ne Deschamps Adams, who as a teenager in France defied death by spying for groups resisting Nazi occupiers and their collaborators, and later for the United States, died on Sept. 16 in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Karyn Anick Monget, who noted that her mother had a variety of maladies, including pneumonia.         H√©l√®ne Deschamps came from a military family, was a tomboy and hated the thought of the Nazis' taking over her country. This combination propelled her to volunteer to fight with the French Resistance. Her youthful looks, insouciance and an accent German soldiers found delightful helped provide cover.         She reported on airfield locations, German mines and antiaircraft and camouflaged emplacements along the shores of the Mediterranean. She saved American parachutists from capture at drop zones and helped Jewish families escape to Spain.         ''H√©l√®ne was a very gutsy young woman,'' Henry Hyde, the chief of American intelligence in France during World War II, said in an interview in ''Women in the Resistance'' by Margaret L. Rossiter (Praeger, 1985). ''She went through the lines for us, observing German defense installations and order of battle,'' he said. ''She took many risks and was a genuinely good operator.''         She was captured by resistance fighters from another resistance group while carrying fake German papers and was almost executed. A close friend she regarded as a sister, whom she had recruited to spy with her, was killed by a sniper while she was in the back seat of a car driven by Ms. Deschamps, who then quickly had to dig the grave.         She hid in a closet full of apples while drunken Germans tormented her French protectors. She watched in silent terror as Nazi soldiers brutalized a pregnant woman at a roadside.         In an interview with CNN in 1996, Mrs. Deschamps Adams said her years of espionage had ''no glamour, no romance, no dinner at the embassy in a designer gown.''         There was only a necessary job, she said. ''You have to forget your own feelings.''         Gratitude was never plentiful. Mrs. Deschamps Adams's daughter said her mother never got the pension that she said had been promised by someone in the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime spy agency that was the C.I.A.'s precursor. She got no awards from governments until 2000, when the United States gave her the Distinguished Service Medal and France recognized her heroism in a joint ceremony.         She did find love on the battlefield. After a whirlwind weekend with an American first lieutenant, Forest E. Adams, whom she met while he was on furlough, she accepted his marriage proposal and came to the United States with him in 1946. Their daughter said neither knew much of the other's language, but shared what her mother called ''the language of love.''         Mr. Adams died of a heart attack in 1951, and Mrs. Deschamps Adams never remarried. Karyn, a baby at the time of her father's death, said her mother told her she never met a man as good as the one she lost.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Deschamps Adams is survived by a brother, Henri Deschamps of Maraussan, France.         H√©l√®ne Marguerite Deschamps was born on Jan. 30, 1921, in the French concession of what was then called Tientsin, China, and was raised in Senegal, Madagascar and R√©union, an island department of France in the Indian Ocean. Her father, a general in the French colonial army, retired to Aix-en-Provence, in the south of France, in the late 1930's.         She was studying in a convent when Hitler invaded France in 1940. The advice of her mentor, a French colonel who had been a friend of her father's, was to ''join the Red Cross or something,'' not the underground.         She had no special training when she and the friend she recruited began riding their bicycles to spy on German troops -- some of whom gallantly helped with bike repairs.         She was given the code name Anick and posed as a secretary at the headquarters of the Milice, the special police force known as the French Gestapo. She stole the records of people marked for execution, including Jews and resistance fighters, and stuffed them in her brassiere, her daughter said, then flushed them down the toilet.         She suffered a permanent back injury when she was beaten by a French interrogator, and was partly deaf because she walked into a building where she knew a bomb had been planted, and it went off just as she was leaving.         When she became disillusioned with the resistance because so many anti-Nazi groups were competing against one another, a resistance leader arranged for her to meet an O.S.S. agent, who accepted her on the strength of the leader's word.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Deschamps Adams worked on a Lockheed assembly line and then taught French in many places, including Iran, Hawaii, Germany and Bermuda. She wrote two memoirs, ''The Secret War'' (W. H. Allen, 1980) and ''Spyglass: An Autobiography'' (Henry Holt, 1995).         In the introduction to ''Spyglass,'' she asked a question: ''If you had to renounce family, friends, any kind of a normal lifestyle to fight a fierce enemy, would you?''       
         Astrid Varnay, the charismatic dramatic soprano whose distinguished 55-year career began at 23 with a last-minute debut at the Metropolitan Opera, singing the role of Sieglinde in Wagner's ''Walk√ºre'' for an indisposed Lotte Lehmann, died in Munich on Monday. She was 88.         The cause was a pericardial infection after a long illness, said the writer Donald Arthur, who collaborated with Ms. Varnay on her autobiography, ''Fifty-Five Years in Five Acts: My Life in Opera'' (2000, Northeastern University Press).         As a Wagnerian soprano, Ms. Varnay never achieved the widespread public recognition of her beloved mentor Kirsten Flagstad or her good friend Birgit Nilsson, who like Ms. Varnay was born in Sweden in 1918. But to opera buffs and insiders, Ms. Varnay was a comparably excellent artist.         Her voice had a remarkable range of colorings, from steely luster in climactic outbursts to dusky mellowness in lyrical phrases. She was an alluring woman and a natural actress who conveyed both tragic dignity and impetuosity. Text and music were one in Ms. Varnay's subtle interpretations.         Her work recently came to public attention again when the Testament label released the first two installments of a complete account of Wagner's ''Ring,'' recorded live at the 1955 Bayreuth Festival in Germany. Ms. Varnay, portraying Br√ºnnhilde in ''Die Walk√ºre'' and ''Siegfried,'' sings with shimmering intensity and keen dramatic insight.         In a phone interview yesterday, James Levine called Ms. Varnay ''one of the truly unique singers'' and recalled working with her in 1979 when, at 61, she sang the role of the hard-bitten Widow Begbick in John Dexter's gritty production of the Weill-Brecht opera ''The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.''         ''I can't think of anyone else who had a grip on the whole thing the way she did,'' Mr. Levine said. ''She sang from the inside out.'' He added: ''The whole score, everything was in her realization, and the presence and the drama were always in balance with the music.''         Though opera was the family business, Ms. Varnay was a latecomer to singing. Ibolyka Astrid Maria Varnay was born in Stockholm on April 25, 1918, to Hungarian parents. At the time, her mother, Maria Javor, a noted coloratura soprano, and her father, Alexander Varnay, a tenor who became a stage director and producer, were working at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm.         In a story she loved to tell in later life, Ms. Varnay said her mother used the bottom drawer of a dressing table backstage as a makeshift crib for her infant daughter during a performance of Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera.'' The table belonged to the company's prima donna, Flagstad, who watched over the baby.         When Astrid was 4, the Varnay family, in search of opportunities, moved to Buenos Aires and then to New York. Her father, who was working as a director at the Manhattan Opera House, died suddenly in 1924. Her mother married an Italian tenor, and the family settled in Jersey City, where Ms. Varnay was brought up.         She set her sights on becoming a pianist. But her vocal talent was overwhelming and she began serious training at 20, working privately with Hermann Weigert, a coach and assistant conductor at the Met. When she sang an audition for Edward Johnson, then the general manager of the Met, he could not believe that Ms. Varnay, a 22-year-old, had learned 13 daunting soprano roles.         When he needed a Sieglinde at the last minute for a Saturday matinee broadcast performance of ''Die Walk√ºre'' on Dec. 6, 1941, he turned to Ms. Varnay, who had not even had a stage rehearsal. Cultural news that weekend was pushed aside by the events of the following day: the attack on Pearl Harbor. Still, the opera world took notice.         The New York Times review reported that the ''exceedingly comely Swedish-American soprano acted with a skill and grace only possible to those with an inborn talent for the theater.''         Six days later, Helen Traubel, scheduled to sing Br√ºnnhilde in ''Die Walk√ºre,'' took ill and Ms. Varnay, in another last-minute substitution, sang the role, wowing New York audiences and critics.         In 1944 she married her coach, Mr. Weigert, who died in 1955. (Ms. Varnay has no immediate survivors.) Though in the late 1940's she branched into the Italian repertory, at the Met she was known for her Wagner interpretations. She sang around 200 performances with the company.         Still, disagreements with Rudolf Bing, who became the Met's general manager in 1950, led her to concentrate her career in Europe. She became a mainstay of companies in Berlin, Munich and Vienna. She was a particular favorite of Wieland Wagner, Richard Wagner's grandson, who ran the Bayreuth Festival and directed Ms. Varnay in several of his radically abstract and spare productions.         In the late 1960's she gave up her weighty dramatic soprano repertory, which included a chilling portrayal of Strauss's Elektra, and began a ''second career,'' as she called it, singing mezzo-soprano roles and character parts. Mr. Levine said when he asked Ms. Varnay late in her career why she still undertook small roles like Mamma Lucia in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' she told him, '' 'I just love being on stage, seeing up close the work of my younger colleagues.' ''       
         Iva Toguri D'Aquino, the Japanese-American convicted of treason in 1949 for broadcasting propaganda from Japan to United States servicemen in World War II as the seductive but sinister Tokyo Rose, died Tuesday in Chicago.         Mrs. D'Aquino, who served more than six years in prison but steadfastly denied disloyalty and received a presidential pardon in 1977, was 90. Her death, at a Chicago hospital, was confirmed by a nephew, William Toguri, The Associated Press reported.         Tokyo Rose was a mythical figure. The persona, its origin murky, had been bestowed by American servicemen collectively on a dozen or so women who broadcast for Radio Tokyo, telling soldiers, sailors and marines in the Pacific that their cause was lost and that their sweethearts back home were betraying them.         The broadcasts did nothing to dim American morale. The servicemen enjoyed the recordings of American popular music, and the United States Navy bestowed a satirical citation on Tokyo Rose at war's end for her entertainment value.         But the identity of Tokyo Rose became attached to Mrs. D'Aquino, a native of Southern California and the only woman broadcasting for Radio Tokyo known to be an American citizen. She emerged as an infamous figure in a rare treason trial.         Convicted in 1949 by a federal jury in San Francisco on one of eight vaguely worded counts, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. She served six years and two months, then lived quietly in Chicago, running a family gift shop. On Jan. 19, 1977, she was pardoned, without comment, by President Gerald R. Ford on his last full day in office, and her citizenship was restored.         ''A mere wartime myth, Tokyo Rose was to become a disgrace to American justice,'' Edwin O. Reischauer, the American ambassador to Japan from 1961 to 1966 and a scholar at Harvard specializing in East Asian affairs, wrote in his introduction to ''Tokyo Rose: Orphan of the Pacific,'' by Masayo Duus.         The treason charges, Mr. Reischauer wrote, were ''egged on by a public still much under the influence of traditional racial prejudices and far from free of the anti-Japanese hatreds of the recent war.''         Iva Ikuko Toguri was born in Los Angeles on the Fourth of July, 1916, a daughter of Japanese immigrants who owned a grocery store. She graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1940 with a degree in zoology, hoping to become a physician.         In the summer of 1941, she visited an ailing aunt in Tokyo at the request of her mother. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, she was stranded in Tokyo, knowing virtually no Japanese, deprived of a food ration card by the authorities after refusing to become a Japanese citizen and hard pressed to find work.         In 1942, she obtained a job with Japan's Domei news agency, monitoring American military broadcasts, and late in 1943 she became an announcer and disc jockey for Radio Tokyo's propaganda broadcasts, playing American musical recordings on the ''Zero Hour'' program beamed to American servicemen. She called herself Ann or Orphan Ann, short for announcer and a play on the Orphan Annie character.         While continuing to work for Radio Tokyo in 1945, she married Felipe D'Aquino, a Domei news agency employee with Portuguese citizenship and Japanese ancestry.         When the war ended, several American reporters learned of Mrs. D'Aquino's broadcasts and interviewed her in Japan. She said she was Tokyo Rose, evidently presuming no great notoriety would be attached to that and perhaps hoping to embellish an intriguing story for American readers, having been paid for her account in a magazine article.         She subsequently denied ever having called herself Tokyo Rose in her broadcasts, and no evidence was produced to the contrary.         As an outgrowth of the publicity, Mrs. D'Aquino was arrested and questioned by American military occupation authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. United Press quoted her at the time as saying, ''I didn't think I was doing anything disloyal to America.''         In the fall of 1946, Mrs. D'Aquino was released from custody in Japan after the Army and the Justice Department concluded that there were no grounds for prosecuting her. But the Justice Department reopened the case in 1948. Loyalty issues were becoming a national political flash point, although mainly in the context of the cold war, and the American Legion and the powerful columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell had spoken out against Mrs. D'Aquino.         Mrs. D'Aquino, who had unsuccessfully sought permission from the American authorities to return to California, was arrested on charges of treason, transported to San Francisco, held in a county jail for a year, then put on trial in 1949.         Treason, the only crime outlined in detail in the Constitution, is defined as ''levying war'' against the United States or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. A defendant may be convicted only ''on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.''         Up to the end of World War II, there had been only about 30 treason cases in United States history. When Mrs. D'Aquino went on trial, five Americans had been convicted of treason for actions in the war, four having broadcast for Nazi Germany, most notably Mildred Gillars, known as Axis Sally.         Tom DeWolfe, a special assistant attorney general, told the jury that Mrs. D'Aquino had engaged in ''nefarious propagandistic broadcasts'' without being under duress. Former supervisors for Radio Tokyo testified that she had made propaganda broadcasts willingly, and a few broadcast tapes were played for the jury, though none were identified as containing Mrs. D'Aquino's voice.         Testifying at the 12-week trial, Mrs. D'Aquino denied that she had ever made any disloyal statements on Radio Tokyo. She was supported in testimony from former Allied prisoners of war who had worked in the Japanese broadcasting operation. In a statement that she had given to the F.B.I. in Japan and that was entered in the court record, she said that she had sought to reduce the programs' effectiveness as propaganda by inserting double meanings in some of her broadcasts.         Mrs. D'Aquino was convicted on a single count of treason, relating to a broadcast she was alleged to have made to American servicemen in October 1944, referring to the loss of their ships. According to prosecution testimony, she said: ''Orphans of the Pacific, you really are orphans now. How will you get home now that all your ships are lost?''         After serving her sentence at the federal penitentiary for women in Alderson, W.Va., Mrs. D'Aquino fought government efforts to deport her. She ran an Asian grocery store and gift shop on Chicago's North Side that family members had opened after their release from a wartime internment camp in Arizona. Her husband returned to Japan after her trial, and she never saw him again.         President Ford pardoned Mrs. D'Aquino after she appealed to him in writing. The decision was supported by a unanimous vote of the California State Legislature, the national Japanese-American Citizens League, and S. I. Hayakawa, a United States senator-elect from California.         ''It is hard to believe,'' Mrs. D'Aquino said on receiving word of President Ford's action. ''But I have always maintained my innocence -- this pardon is a measure of vindication.''       
         Ernestine Bayer, who founded a pioneering women's rowing club in 1938 on the Schuylkill in Philadelphia, rowed competitively into her 90's and became known as the mother of women's rowing, died Sept. 10 in Exeter, N.H. She was 97.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said her daughter, Tina Bayer, a former world-class rower.         Persevering when competitive female rowers were regarded as curiosities, Bayer reveled in teaching women to row. She championed inclusion of women's rowing in the Olympics, a goal attained in 1976 at the Montreal Games, when she served on the United States Olympic Committee's women's rowing unit.         In 1984, she became the first woman elected to the National Rowing Hall of Fame. In 1992, USRowing -- rowing's national governing body -- presented her with its highest honor, and it annually presents a medal in her name for outstanding contributions to women's rowing.         A native of Philadelphia and, as she recalled, a onetime tomboy, to the consternation of her ladylike mother, Bayer endured a decade of frustrated ambitions before embarking on her rowing career.         She had met Ernest Bayer while he was training on the Schuylkill for the rowing competition at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, and they married in January 1928. Ernest Bayer was a member of the coxless-four crew that went on to win an Olympic silver medal, and he continued to train on the Schuylkill during the 1930's, with Ernestine watching from the shore or accompanying him in his boat.         One day, she saw a woman take her boyfriend's boat onto the river and asked her husband why she could not row as well. He told her that women simply did not row.         Her husband eventually let her take out a small boat. ''Three-quarters of the men, I'm sorry to say, wouldn't speak to him,'' she told The Syracuse Herald American in 1996. ''When they did talk, they'd tell him girls had no right to be out on the river rowing.''         But in 1938, she led a group of young women who formed the Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club on the Schuylkill's Boathouse Row. ''In the past, women had rowed for exercise,'' Tina Bayer said in a telephone interview yesterday, but the Philadelphia club, she said, was the first competitive women's rowing organization in the United States. Ernestine Bayer became the club's president, the members receiving instruction from her husband.         Bayer soon won the first women's race on the Schuylkill, a doubles competition among club members. She had limited opportunities to compete after that since so few women were rowing. But in 1967, she persuaded American rowing officials to select her club as the first American crew to take part in the European women's rowing championship. The club's eight-oared boat, which included Tina Bayer in the crew, finished sixth and last at the competition in Vichy, France. But that appearance by the United States on the world rowing scene provided impetus for the inclusion of women's rowing in the Olympics.         In the early 1970's, the Bayer family moved to Stratham, N.H., living along the Squamscott River, and Ernestine Bayer founded the Alden Ocean Shell Association, whose members used an all-purpose boat called the Alden. That association became a major recreational group. The Bayer family also forged women's rowing into a varsity sport at the University of New Hampshire.         Ernestine Bayer captured many medals in master's races, and at 92 she won two golds and a silver, competing in doubles and eight-oared events, in the 60-and-over category at the masters world championships in Montreal.         Tina Bayer is her only survivor. Ernest Bayer died in 1997 at 92.         In 1984, the United States women's eight won a gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. Later that year, after Bayer and the crew were inducted into the Rowing Hall of Fame, the crew members invited Bayer to row with them as a tribute to her pioneering.         That ceremonial row symbolized the realization of her dreams for women's rowing.         Reliving the moment, she told The Boston Globe in 1996 how ''we came in and I sat on the dock and I cried.''       
         Martha Holmes, a photographer for Life magazine for 40 years, who was known for her intimate portraits but also for covering sports at a time when that was male turf, died on Sept. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The death was confirmed by her son-in-law, John Koshel.         Hired by Life in 1944 when she was 20, Ms. Holmes was one of five women who were photographers at the magazine during its glory decades as the nation's most popular publisher of photography.         She worked in Hollywood, Washington and New York -- for five years on staff and for 35 years as a freelancer -- capturing images of movie stars like Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Van Johnson, Joan Crawford and John Garfield, and of public figures like the union leader John L. Lewis, caught in a scowl, and Eleanor Roosevelt sipping tomato juice.         ''She had a talent for extracting the best from people,'' said Bobbi Burrows, the director of photography for Life Books and an editor at the magazine for 40 years. ''She brought intimacy out of her subjects; people felt they were in good hands.''         Perhaps Ms. Holmes's most famous image is of the abstract painter Jackson Pollock, taken at his home studio in East Hampton, N.Y., for the issue of Aug. 8, 1949. It shows Pollock crouching over a canvas with paint cupped in his right hand, demonstrating his technique for applying an unbroken stream of black enamel, a cigarette dangling from his mouth.         In 1999 the photograph was the model for a 33-cent postage stamp. The Postal Service hired an artist, Howard Koslow, to copy it -- telling him to leave out the dangling cigarette, in the interest of public health.         Another well-known photo by Ms. Holmes, taken in 1947 during the Hollywood blacklist era, shows Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Danny Kaye in the audience at a hearing of the House Un-American Activities Committee, looks of concern on their faces.         Ms. Holmes's son-in-law, Mr. Koshel, said he once showed her the picture and suggested that it was an indication of her political point of view.         ''Martha remarked, 'No, I just saw Bogey was upset,' '' he said.         Martha Louise Holmes was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 7, 1923. Her father, George Holmes, worked in public relations; her mother, Emma Auer Holmes, was a voice coach. Ms. Holmes is survived by two daughters, Anne Waxman of Manhattan and Terry Koshel of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and two grandchildren. Her husband of 46 years, Arthur Waxman, died in 1998.         Ms. Holmes became interested in photography as teenager. She attended the University of Louisville for a year, but then was hired as a photo lab assistant at The Louisville Courier-Journal. Soon after, she was given a three-month trial as a cub photographer.         Two years later a Life photographer noticed her work and recommended that the magazine hire her. One of her first assignments was to cover the Kentucky Derby, where a male photographer shoved her aside. She later said she just elbowed him in the chest.         Ms. Burrows said Ms. Holmes's favorite photo, taken in 1949, is of the jazz singer Billy Eckstine surrounded by grinning female fans, one with her head on his chest.         ''It was groundbreaking back then in that it was a black man hugging a white woman,'' Ms. Burrrows said. ''There was a discussion about whether we should run it or not.'' An editor took the print to Henry R. Luce, Life's publisher, Ms. Burrows said. ''And Mr. Luce said, 'Run it.' ''         In 1953 Ms. Holmes was the subject of a sports-page article in The Louisville Times. Headlined ''Gal Sent to Cover Marciano Camp,'' it tells how she was assigned to shoot the heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano at his training camp at Grossinger's resort in the Catskills. In the article Ms. Holmes tells how an assignment editor at Life looked around, pointed and said, ''You.''         ''Who, me?'' Ms. Holmes recalled saying.         ''Yes, you're a photographer, aren't you?'' the editor said.       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         Ms. Richard died, surrounded by her four children, of complications from the esophageal cancer, the Associated Press reported.         Ms. Richards was the most recent and one of the most effective in a long-line of Lone Star State progressives who vied for control of Texas in the days when it was largely a one-party Democratic enclave, a champion of civil rights, gay rights and feminism. Her defeat by the future president was one of the chief markers of the end of generations of Democratic dominance in Texas.         So cemented was her celebrity on the national stage, however, that she appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips, and was a lawyer and lobbyist for Public strategies and Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand.         ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the Democratic convention in 1988, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her acidic, plain-spoken keynote address was one of the year's political highlights and catapulted the one-term Texas governor into a national figure.         ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said, bringing the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory to the national political stage in a way that transformed the mother of four into an revered icon of feminist activism.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, in Lakeview, and graduated in 1950 from Waco High school where she showed a special facility for debate. She attended the Girl's Mock State government in Austin in her junior year and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girl's Nation in Washington.         She attended Baylor University in Waco -- on a debate scholarship -- where she met her future husband, David Richards. After college, the couple moved to Austin where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School.         She raised her four children in Austin.         She volunteered in several gubernatorial campaigns, in 1958 for Henry Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough and then again for Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin, and held that job for four years, though she later said her political commitment put a strain on her marriage, which ended in divorce.         She also began to drink heavily, eventually going into rehabilitation, a move that she later credited with salvaging her life and her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer, received the most votes of any statewide candidate, became the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years and was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when the incumbent governor, William P. Clements Jr., decided not to run for re-election, she ran against a former Democratic governor, Mark White, and won the primary, then later fought a particularly brutal campaign against Republican candidate Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, and won.         Among her achievements were institutional changes in the state penal system, invigorating the state's economy and instituting the first Texas lottery, going so far as to buy the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         It was her speech to the Democratic convention in Atlanta, though, that made her a national figure.         A champion of women's rights, she told the television audience: ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         In 1992, she was chairwoman of the convention that first nominated Bill Clinton.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, going so far as to refer to George W. Bush as ''some jerk,'' a commend that drew considerable criticism. Later, she acknowledged that the younger candidate has been much more effective at ''staying on message'' and made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten, 53 percent to 46 percent.         Her celebrity, however, carried her onto the boards of several national corporations, including J.C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         She also co-wrote several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' in 1989 with Peter Knobler and ''I'm Not Slowing Down'' in 2004, with Richard M. Levine.         On her 60th birthday, she got her first motorcycle license.         ''I've always said that in politics, your enemies can't hurt you, but your friends can kill you,'' Ms. Richard once said.         Survivors, according to The AP, include her children, Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen Richards, and eight grandchildren.         Correction:  September 15, 2006, Friday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about former Gov. Ann Richards of Texas referred incorrectly to her later positions with the public relations company Public Strategies and the international law firm Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper). She was an adviser to both, not a lobbyist and lawyer. She did not have a law degree. The obituary also misstated the middle initial of the co-author of her book ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis.'' He is Richard U. Levine, not Richard M. A full obituary appears today on Page A23.       
         Princess Irene Galitzine, a descendant of Russian nobility who founded a glamorous fashion house in Italy and popularized ornate pants as evening wear in the 1960's, died Friday at her home in Rome. She was believed to be 90.         Her death was announced by Angela Savarese, her assistant, who said she died in her sleep. She left no immediate survivors.         Princess Galitzine's couture collections, shown in a Roman villa, were once praised as the social highlight of the fashion season, and her salon on the Via Veneto was where du Ponts competed with Fords to have first crack at her designs, which often featured a spiral cut. Greta Garbo, whom the princess befriended aboard the yacht of Aristotle Onassis, once appeared at a Galitzine presentation, ''although she disliked the crowd,'' the princess said.         Her most famous design was the evening pants she introduced in Florence about a decade after starting her company, with styles either slim and embroidered or flowing in gauzy fabrics. Diana Vreeland, in Vogue, called them ''palazzo pajamas,'' after the setting of the shows in the Palazzo Pitti. (The princess showed her ready-to-wear line in Florence and her couture designs in Rome, when women who bought those clothes routinely went there to find less expensive designs than those shown in Paris.)         Some American designers, notably Arnold Scaasi, Jane Derby and Norman Norell, had already experimented with the idea of fancy dinner pants for women, but it was Princess Galitzine's appearances in the designs at great society parties that inspired other women to buy them. She said in 1960 that she was deluged with orders even before she showed the look at a fashion show.         ''I was one of Emilio Pucci's best customers, but I got tired of seeing the same clothes I was wearing on other people, so I began making my own things,'' she once said. ''I put them in my first collection, and everybody went wild.''         The most famous palazzo pajamas of all were the ones worn by Claudia Cardinale in the original version of ''The Pink Panther'' (1963). They have frequently been exhibited in Italian fashion retrospectives, including one at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York in 1985 and one in Rome this year.         Princess Irene Galitzine was born in 1916 in Tiflis, Russia (now called Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia). Her father, Prince Boris Galitzine, was an official of the imperial guard, and her mother was Princess Nina Lazareff. When she was 10 months old, her family went into exile during the Bolshevik Revolution, moving to Rome, where they bought a house overlooking the Spanish Steps.         The young princess received a lavish education, learning English at Cambridge and French at the Sorbonne. She worked briefly translating English-language film dialogues, but after studying art and design in Rome, she became an assistant, in 1943, to the Fontana sisters, who operated the most successful Italian couture house of the time.         The princess then started a business importing and reproducing French designs, favoring the collections of Balenciaga and Dior. She married Silvio M√©dici de Menezes, a Portuguese aristocrat, in 1949.         The princess began casually designing evening wear for herself and her prominent friends, including Jacqueline Kennedy and the actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn, and eventually decided to work as a designer. Her first show was in 1959, which was an immediate success. She was not as skilled at running a business, however. The company declared bankruptcy in 1968 and then was resurrected several times by manufacturing companies that produced her designs less expensively and in larger quantities.         In the 1990's, the princess returned to Russia several times and opened a store in Moscow in 1996. Fashion and home designs are still manufactured under her name under several licenses in Europe.         Her experience was chronicled in a biography, ''From Russia to Russia,'' published in 1996.       
         Jane Wyatt, who reigned as America's ideal suburban mom during the 1950's when she starred with Robert Young in the television sitcom ''Father Knows Best'' and who nearly lured Ronald Colman away from diplomacy and into a lamasery in Frank Capra's 1937 film ''Lost Horizon,'' died on Friday at her home in Bel Air, Calif. She was 95.         Her death was confirmed by her publicist Meg McDonald, The Associated Press reported.         A petite, attractive brunette, Ms. Wyatt found it hard to avoid being typecast and wound up playing quite a few of what she described as ''good wives of good men,'' though she confessed she would have been happier ''playing the murderer or the heavy.'' She did get to play a few offbeat roles on stage and screen. In Philip Barry's wryly titled play ''The Joyous Season'' (1934), she was a moody member of a family seething with petty feuds. As the wife of an attorney (Dana Andrews) in the 1947 film ''Boomerang,'' she became embroiled in the corruption surrounding a notorious murder. And in Lillian Hellman's ''Autumn Garden,'' on Broadway in 1951, she was married to an indolent drifter (Fredric March) for whom she felt nothing but contempt.         For the most part, however, as she shuttled between Hollywood and Broadway, she was called upon to be loyal, loving and courageous. In ''None but the Lonely Heart,'' a 1944 film starring Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore, she was an adoring musician who pined for an indifferent Grant. She was cast as a courageous nurse in ''Canadian Pacific'' (1949); as the faithful, supportive wife of a naval airman (Gary Cooper) in ''Task Force'' (1949); and as a happily married (to David Wayne) mother of five in ''My Blue Heaven'' (1950).         Her Broadway credits included ''Night Music'' (1940), by Clifford Odets, a Group Theater production directed by Harold Clurman, in which she played a young woman who finds the love of her life in New York; and ''Hope for the Best'' (1945), by William McCleery, with Ms. Wyatt as a factory worker who helps a popular columnist (Franchot Tone) see the light of liberalism.         Jane Waddington Wyatt was born on Aug. 12, 1911, in Campgaw, N.J., into a family of distinguished lineage and grew up in New York City. Her father was an investment banker, her mother a writer for Commonweal and other publications. She attended the Chapin School and studied at Barnard College for two years before joining the apprentice school at the Berkshire Playhouse in Stockbridge, Mass. Back in New York she found work as an understudy in a Broadway show, and her name was removed from the New York Social Register. Clearly, the wicked stage was no place for proper young ladies.         Not daunted, she continued to audition and soon made her Broadway debut in 1931 in A. A. Milne's ''Give Me Yesterday,'' as the daughter of an ambitious British politician (Louis Calhern). She achieved a breakthrough of sorts in 1933 when she succeeded Margaret Sullavan in ''Dinner at Eight,'' the hit comedy by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, and then toured in the show, leading to a contract offer from Universal and her Hollywood debut in ''One More River'' (1934), based on John Galsworthy's last novel.         Ms. Wyatt said at one point that her favorite film role had been in ''Task Force,'' opposite Gary Cooper, but she is probably best remembered for her work in ''Lost Horizon,'' based on the novel by James Hilton and directed by Frank Capra. Most of the film's action takes place in Tibet in a fabled region called Shangri-La, ruled by an ancient High Lama. A plane crash brings a small group of Westerners led by a British diplomat Bob Conway (Ronald Colman) to the lamasery. There, Colman meets and is entranced by Sondra (Ms. Wyatt), an attractive young woman who has grown up in Shangri-La. The High Lama is looking for a successor, Sondra is looking for love, and the Colman character must choose whether to stay or return to the war-torn world beyond the mountains. Critics agreed that Ms. Wyatt was luminous in the role.         Ms. Wyatt had already made a number of appearances in television dramas before she joined the cast of ''Father Knows Best'' in 1954. The show followed the lives of the Anderson family in the Midwestern town of Springfield, with Robert Young as Jim Anderson, Ms. Wyatt as his wife, Margaret, and their three children, two of them teenagers. Family crises arose -- a son's first dance, a daughter's first crush -- and were firmly but lovingly resolved. When CBS dropped the show in 1955 there were so many protests from viewers that NBC was persuaded to pick it up. ''Father Knows Best'' returned to CBS for the 1959-1960 season, its final run of new episodes. The show brought Ms. Wyatt three Emmy Awards. In 1977 she returned to the role, this time as a grandmother, in two made-for-television movies, ''The Father Knows Best Reunion'' and ''Father Knows Best: Home for Christmas.''         Ms. Wyatt married Edgar Bethune Ward in 1935. He died in 2000. She is survived by their two sons, Christopher Ward of Piedmont, Calif., and Michael Ward of Los Angeles; three grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         One of her more offbeat television parts was that of Amanda, the human mother of Mr. Spock, the pointy-eared Vulcan member of the ''Star Trek'' crew of space voyagers in the late 1960's. She reprised the role in the 1986 film, ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.''         Correction:  October 24, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary and headline yesterday about the actress Jane Wyatt misstated her age. She was 96, not 95. (The error was repeated in a front-page contents entry and in the News Summary.)       
         Petra Cabot, whose first and deepest love was painting but whose most famous work was an insulated pail covered with plaid, the ubiquitous Skotch Kooler of the 1950s, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 99.         Her friend Nancy Kline announced the death. Ms. Cabot also had a home in Manhattan.         The Skotch Kooler, copyrighted in 1952, was made by the Hamilton Metal Products Company of Hamilton, Ohio. It could keep ice cream firm for two to three hours without ice and was handy for a fishing trip: it kept groceries cold on the way to the lake and fish cold on the way back.         The container held four gallons and had three layers of insulation: one of fiberglass, one of inert air and a heat-reflecting outer surface. It was airtight and waterproof and, long before the practice was common, it carried the signature of its designer. (Knockoff versions, without the signature, were made as far away as Thailand.) The coolers are now popular collectibles.         ''I decided to make the best-looking bucket anybody ever saw,'' Ms. Cabot said, according to an interview several years ago with Ms. Kline's mother, Polly Kline.         Emma Mearns, who later changed her name to Petra (pronounced PEE-tra), was an only child born in Philadelphia on Feb. 21, 1907. She was educated in crafts and fine arts and started winning design prizes in her teens.         She designed costumes and sets for stage productions, then spent a year painting in Europe. In the Depression years, she participated in two federally sponsored arts projects and became involved in the lively art scene in and around Woodstock. She also taught at the City and Country School in Manhattan.         In 1945, she designed a mural depicting the history of the National Maritime Union. It occupied 840 square feet of wall space in the union's Manhattan offices, now a hotel, and was a montage of newspaper clippings and photographs.         From 1938 until 1950, she worked for the designer Russel Wright, who brought modernism to the American home with his inexpensive, mass-produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances and textiles. One of Ms. Cabot's first assignments for Wright was the food pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939, which received favorable mention from critics.         Ms. Cabot married Laurence Jordan, a poet, when she was 19; the marriage ended in divorce in 1931. In 1937, she married Blake Cabot, a medical writer and publisher, who died in 1974. She left no immediate survivors.       
         Rosamond Carr, a Manhattan fashion illustrator whose love affair with Africa long survived her divorce from the dashing big-game hunter she followed there and culminated when she, as an octogenarian, opened an orphanage in war-ravaged Rwanda, died on Sept. 29. She was 94.         She died of pneumonia at her home near Gisenyi in the mountains of northwest Rwanda, said Ann Howard Halsey, her niece.         Mrs. Carr owned a flower plantation in a volcanic paradise, was stalked by leopards, pestered by elephants and cuddled by monkeys and became a close friend of Dian Fossey, the mountain gorilla researcher, who was mysteriously killed in 1985.         Mrs. Carr became a successful businesswoman at a time when they were rare in Africa. She endured political turmoil most Westerners fled. But her world was upended when Rwanda's Hutu massacred another of the country's ethnic groups, the Tutsi, and killings were committed on her property, eight of them in her flower garden.         When the spear-wielding mob demanded to know the whereabouts of yet another potential victim, Mrs. Carr exploded.         ''You don't mind killing old women,'' she said, as recorded in her 1999 autobiography, ''Land of a Thousand Hills: My Life in Rwanda.'' ''If you want to kill someone, here I am. Kill me!''         Mrs. Carr was forced to flee on five minutes' notice. Once in the United States, as televised images made the magnitude of the tragedy apparent -- perhaps 800,000 dead, two million exiled, two million more in refuge camps in Rwanda -- she made a decision.         It involved a capacious building she had used to dry flowers. It somehow seemed like the perfect place for an orphanage. With arduous work, it became one.         ''One of the few regrets in my life is that I never had children of my own,'' she wrote, three years after the arrival of the first orphan, a boy named Gahungu, whose mother had dropped dead in front of him. ''Today at the age of 85, I am blessed with 72,'' she said.         Mrs. Carr's life does not merely sound cinematic. The actress Julie Harris played her in ''Gorillas in the Mist,'' the movie about Ms. Fossey. A British company is making a documentary about Mrs. Carr, and producers have bought rights to her book, which Ms. Halsey helped write.         Rosamond Halsey was born in 1912 in South Orange, N.J. Her father was a bond trader ruined by the Depression, and college was not an option. She became an illustrator for department stores.         She happened to see some films about Africa presented by Kenneth Carr, who had lived there for 28 years, hunting big game and working as a tattoo artist, coffee planter and miner. An Englishman, he was a charming conversationalist and gave her a lion's claw covered with gold. They married, struggled financially and soon had trouble getting along. They decided that moving to Africa might help.         ''Most people would go to a marriage counselor, but they went to Africa,'' Ms. Halsey said.         Mrs. Carr, then 37, bought four cotton dresses, a pith helmet ''and a lifetime supply of cold cream'' and the two sailed away on a tramp steamer. They chugged 1,280 miles up the Congo River in a wood-burning paddle-wheel steamer, then drove a second-hand Ford pickup to the Congo-Rwanda border, where they eventually managed a farm.         It was beautiful and exotic: there was a 50-foot waterfall on their property, wildlife prowled, and Mrs. Carr became fascinated by local culture. She dispensed medicine to the people.         The marriage foundered, and in the mid-1950's, Mrs. Carr bought a 270-acre flower plantation in the foothills of the Virunga volcanoes. She lived in an ivy-covered stone cottage and planted a formal English garden. She grew fields of lilies and other flowers to sell.         After Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960, most Europeans (with whom Americans were lumped) left. After Rwanda became independent 1962, the dominant Hutu took control, and persecuted the minority Tutsi, who had historically ruled. Year by year, tensions mounted.         Mrs. Carr stayed. She befriended Ms. Fossey, who had moved to Rwanda because of violence in Congo. Theirs was a close but stormy relationship, beginning with an argument about where Rwandan gorillas were and were not. Mrs. Carr was right.         Rwanda's genocide started in 1994 after President Juv√©nal Habyarimana was assassinated. The Hutu government and Hutu gangs mercilessly attacked Tutsi. Waves of retaliations by Tutsi and counterretaliations by Hutu followed.         Violence prevented Mrs. Carr and her 120 orphans from returning to their original home until November 2006. The orphanage, now on a larger, more modern campus, is run by her longtime associates.         Mrs. Carr is survived by her brother, William G. Halsey, of Basking Ridge, N.J., and her sister, Dorothy K. Halsey, of Chatham, Mass.         In her book, Mrs. Carr rhapsodized about relaxing at day's end in front of a crackling fire in a cozy cottage that never had electricity or modern plumbing.         ''My day is done,'' she wrote, ''and I wonder with a flutter of anticipation what new adventures and surprises tomorrow will bring.''         Correction:  October 10, 2006, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Sunday about Rosamond Carr, a former fashion illustrator who opened an orphanage in Rwanda and was driven from it by violence, misstated the date of the orphans' return to the facility. It was November 2005, not November 2006.       
         Wang Guangmei, the widow of President Liu Shaoqi and a powerful figure in China before she was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, died Friday in Beijing. She was 85.         Her death was confirmed by a family member.         Ms. Wang was once widely known in China as its beautiful, articulate, sophisticated first lady.         Liu Shaoqi was president from 1959 to 1967, when he became one of the first high-level officials to be denounced as a ''capitalist roader'' and purged by Mao during the Cultural Revolution.         Mr. Liu died in prison in 1969, after being beaten and tortured. Ms. Wang was also arrested and accused of being an American spy.         In some of the uglier scenes of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, she was publicly humiliated at mass rallies by a group of Red Guards who forced her to wear a necklace of Ping-Pong balls.         After Mao's death in 1976, Mr. Liu was rehabilitated by the Communist Party, and the notorious Gang of Four, who were accused of conspiring on Mao's behalf, were imprisoned and put on trial.         Ms. Wang spent about 12 years in prison, and her four children were also harshly treated. She was released in 1979, just before Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, a leader of the Gang of Four, was put on trial and accused of leading the effort to destroy President Liu and his wife.         Wang Guangmei was born in 1921 and grew up in a distinguished and prominent Chinese family. Her father was a government minister and a diplomat; her mother was an educator.         Ms. Wang studied French, Russian and English, and earned a degree in physics from Furen Catholic University in Beijing. She also studied at an American missionary university.         In the mid-1940's, however, she traveled to the Communist Party headquarters in Yanan and served as an interpreter during efforts by the American statesman George C. Marshall to negotiate a truce between the Nationalist government and the Communist rebels.         There, at the age of 24, she met Liu Shaoqi, who was nearly twice her age and had married five times before.         For years she served as his secretary, and he was named a key deputy to Mao after the Communists took power in 1949. In 1959 Mr. Liu was named president, making him the second most powerful man in the country.         In the early 1960's, the couple traveled abroad on state visits to Afghanistan, Burma, Pakistan and Indonesia.         But in 1966, Ms. Wang was part of a group that purged the party leadership of Tsinghua University, and the effort backfired when she came under attack by a militant opponent who accused her of being a counterrevolutionary. This came at a time when her husband was also under fire by Mao and his deputies as being the leading ''capitalist roader.''         Jiang Qing, Mao's fifth wife, was said to be jealous and angry with Ms. Wang and to have complained about the way she dressed, noting that she even wore a pearl necklace on a trip abroad.         The disgraced Mr. Liu died in prison. Ms. Wang was put under house arrest, then imprisoned. Her four children were also punished.         After she was released from prison in 1979, however, she was appointed a member of the National People's Congress standing committee, and she devoted herself to social causes. She even donated some of her family's valuable antiques, a few dating back to the Qing and Song dynasties, to charity.         She is survived by four children, some of whom have risen to prominent positions.         Her eldest son, Lt. Gen. Liu Yuan, was appointed a political commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences, a rank equivalent to a cabinet minister, according to Reuters.         Her daughter, Ting Liu, graduated from Boston University and Harvard Business School and is chairman and president of the Asia Link Group, consultants in corporate finance.       
         Betty Comden, who with her longtime collaborator Adolph Green wrote the lyrics and often the librettos for some of the most celebrated musicals of stage and screen, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said Ronald Konecky, her lawyer and the executor of her estate.         During a professional partnership that lasted for more than 60 years, and which finally ended with Mr. Green's death in 2002, the Comden-Green blend of sophisticated wit and musical know-how lit up stage shows like ''On the Town,'' ''Wonderful Town,'' ''Peter Pan'' and ''Bells Are Ringing.'' Their Hollywood credits included the screenplays for two landmark film musicals, ''Singin' in the Rain'' and ''The Band Wagon.''         Through the years they worked with composers like Leonard Bernstein, Cy Coleman, Jule Styne and Andr√© Previn, creating songs like ''New York, New York,'' ''The Party's Over,'' ''It's Love'' and ''Some Other Time.'' They were adept at making their lyrics fit the mood, whether it was rueful (''Lonely Town''), raucous (''100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man'') or romantic (''Just in Time'').         The title of one of their own songs, from ''Bells Are Ringing,'' summed up their joint career: it was truly a ''Perfect Relationship'' in which they met daily, most often in Ms. Comden's living room, either to work on a show, to trade ideas or even just talk about the weather.         ''We stare at each other,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''We meet, whether or not we have a project, just to keep up a continuity of working. There are long periods when nothing happens, and it's just boring and disheartening. But we have a theory that nothing's wasted, even those long days of staring at one another. You sort of have to believe that, don't you? That you had to go through all that to get to the day when something did happen.''         Ms. Comden, slim, dark-haired and composed, was the ideal counterbalance to the often rumpled, wild-haired and restless Mr. Green. Sometimes, during discussions, Ms. Comden would finish one of his sentences, or vice versa. Songs and shows grew that way too, although the story was always the starting point.         ''The book comes first,'' Ms. Comden said in the 1977 interview , recalling how the song ''Just in Time'' took shape. ''At some point when we were working on 'Bells Are Ringing,' '' she said, ''Jule Styne wrote that tune. Dee da dum, da dee da dee da dum. We all agreed it had to be in the show somewhere, but for months we couldn't find a place for it, or even a title, but Jule was playing it all over town at parties, calling it 'Dee Da Dum.' And that became the official title until the point where, rewriting part of the book one day, the situation was there, and we finally wrote the words to fit 'Dee Da Dum.' ''         The starting point for their partnership was Greenwich Village where, in the late 1930s, they joined up with another aspiring entertainer named Judy Holliday and two other friends to form a cabaret act. They called themselves the Revuers and persuaded Max Gordon, the owner of a club called the Village Vanguard, that their act would be good for business. It was.         The Revuers opened at the Vanguard in 1939, performing material that included freewheeling sketches like ''The Banshi Sisters'' and ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' a zany operetta, and frequently accompanied at the piano by one of Mr. Green's friends, a talented young musician named Leonard Bernstein, who dropped in often enough to be taken for part of their act.         The act's success earned them a movie offer, and the Revuers traveled west in hopes of finding instant fame in ''Greenwich Village,'' a 1944 movie starring Carmen Miranda and Don Ameche, in which the newcomers turned out to be virtually invisible. Ms. Comden and Mr. Green came back to New York, where they resumed working at the Vanguard and other clubs.         It wasn't long before they heard from Mr. Bernstein, their erstwhile accompanist, who said he'd been working on a ballet with Jerome Robbins and that the two of them had decided that the ballet, called ''Fancy Free,'' had the makings of a Broadway show. They were looking for someone to write the book and lyrics.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green jumped at the chance and jumped into the limelight with their work on the show. The result, ''On the Town,'' the story of three sailors on shore leave in New York, opened late in 1944 and was a smash. Both Ms. Comden and Mr. Green appeared in the show, he as one of the sailors and she as Claire de Loone, an amorous anthropologist. New Yorkers inside and outside the theater were soon humming the town's geography √† la Comden and Green:         The Bronx is up and the Battery's down,         The people ride in a hole in the ground,         New York, New York,         It's a helluva town.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were definitely on their way up, not to the Bronx but to big-time success.         Betty Comden was born Elizabeth Cohen on May 3, 1917, in Brooklyn. Her father, Leo, was a lawyer, her mother, Rebecca, a teacher. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and studied drama at New York University, graduating in 1938.         By that time she had changed her surname to Comden, had had nose surgery to make her look more stageworthy, had acted with the Washington Square Players and had met and become friends with Mr. Green, another aspiring actor. Their circle soon included three other would-be entertainers, Ms. Holliday, Alvin Hammer and John Frank. Then came their decision to form the Revuers, and all else followed.         Ms. Comden married Steven Kyle, a designer and businessman, in 1942. He died in 1979, and she never remarried. They had two children, a daughter, Susanna, and a son, Alan. Their son, a drug addict, contracted AIDS and died of complications of his addiction in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Susanna Kyle, of Manhattan.         Ms. Comden reminisced about her Brooklyn childhood, her student years and her long marriage in a 1995 memoir, ''Off Stage,'' in which she also told of the difficult circumstances of her son's struggle with drugs. The book included tributes to some of her friends and colleagues, among them Mr. Bernstein and Lauren Bacall, but hardly dealt at all with her professional life.         After the success of ''On the Town,'' Ms. Comden and Mr. Green tried their hands at writing the book for another Broadway musical. ''Billion Dollar Baby,'' which opened in 1945, had a score by Morton Gould, choreography by Mr. Robbins and was directed by George Abbott, but it was not as well received.         Hollywood called again, and this time, for the most part, they had better luck. ''Good News'' (1947), with June Allyson and Peter Lawford as singing, dancing campus sweethearts, was their first screenplay. They wrote ''The Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949), which marked the film reunion of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, and adapted ''On the Town'' (1949) for the screen, with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin as the freewheeling sailors navigating the streets of New York.         They contributed heavily to the success of ''The Band Wagon'' (1953), the Vincente Minnelli musical for which they wrote the witty screenplay. The film had a score by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and starred Mr. Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray. The Comden-Green screenplay received an Academy Award nomination.         They were still wedded to Broadway, however, and their stage work during the next few years included the Jule Styne musical ''Two on the Aisle'' (1951), a revue with Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray; ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), an adaptation of the 1939 comedy hit ''My Sister Eileen,'' with music by Mr. Bernstein and starring Rosalind Russell and Edie Adams as two sisters from Ohio trying to make it in the Big Town; and, most notably, ''Bells Are Ringing.''         That 1956 musical reunited them with Ms. Holliday, who headed the cast as an operator at an answering service who falls in love with one of the service's male clients (Sydney Chaplin) after listening to his voice over her telephone line. The score included the comic lament ''I'm Going Back (To the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company)'' as well as some songs that became part of the standard pop repertory, like ''Just in Time,'' ''Long Before I Knew You'' and ''The Party's Over,'' which ended with the melancholy verse:         Now you must wake up         All dreams must end         Take off your makeup         The party's over         It's all over, my friend.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green also wrote the screenplay for the 1960 film version, which starred Ms. Holliday.         Even their less successful shows yielded musical nuggets, one example being the 1960 ''Do Re Mi,'' which had a book by Garson Kanin and music by Mr. Styne for which they wrote the lyrics. It featured Phil Silvers and Nancy Walker. That largely unmemorable score included one gem, ''Make Someone Happy.''         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green went on to write ''Subways Are for Sleeping'' (1961), with Carol Lawrence and Mr. Chaplin, and ''Fade Out-Fade In'' (1964), with Carol Burnett and Jack Cassidy, both shows with music by Mr. Styne, and the lyrics for ''Hallelujah, Baby'' (1968), which had music by Mr. Styne and a book by Arthur Laurents and which starred Leslie Uggams and Robert Hooks. They wrote the book for ''Applause'' (1970), adapted from the film ''All About Eve,'' with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Lee Adams. The show starred Ms. Bacall as the take-no-prisoners movie queen Margo Channing played by Bette Davis in the film.         In the years that followed Ms. Comden and Mr. Green teamed up with the composer Cy Coleman for ''On the Twentieth Century'' (1978), based on the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play about a flamboyant movie producer (John Cullum) and his leading lady (Madeline Kahn), traveling from Hollywood to Broadway on the Twentieth-Century Limited in the 1930s. The show was a hit and brought them Tony Awards for their book and score.         In 1982 they wrote the book and lyrics -- Larry Grossman wrote the music -- for what was meant to be a kind of musical sequel to Ibsen's ''A Doll's House,'' but the result, ''A Doll's Life'' (1982), was a four-performance disaster.         Their last major Broadway show was ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' a 1991 Ziegfeld-style extravaganza with music by Mr. Coleman, book by Peter Stone and direction and choreography by Tommy Tune. Keith Carradine starred as the folksy humorist-philosopher. Despite mixed reviews the show won six Tony Awards, including one for the music and lyrics, and enjoyed a run of two and a half years.         By the time ''Will Rogers'' came along, Ms. Comden and Mr. Green had worked together for more than a half-century. On Broadway, starting with ''On the Town'' in 1944, they had won a shelf full of Tony Awards. They were among the recipients of the 1991 Kennedy Center honors for their contributions to American musical theater.         Their early Hollywood credits included ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' (1949), with Gene Kelly, Mr. Sinatra and Esther Williams, and ''It's Always Fair Weather'' (1955), with Mr. Kelly, Dan Dailey, Michael Kidd and Ms. Charisse, for which their screenplay received an Academy Award nomination. A bittersweet sequel of sorts to ''On the Town,'' the plot of ''It's Always Fair Weather'' revolved around the reunion a decade after World War II of three former G.I. companions who find that time has altered their friendship for the worse.         ''I don't think there's ever been a musical quite like it,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1999 interview with The Times. ''The corrosive effect that time has on friendships -- that's a very unusual subject for a musical.'' She and Mr. Green said it was one of their favorites.         After their stage debut in ''On the Town'' they didn't perform on Broadway again until 1958, when they appeared in ''A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green,'' a revue that included some of their early favorites like ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' which they described as a tribute to the Shubert brothers (''J. J., O. O., and Uh-Uh.''). The revue was well received, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in 1977.         Ms. Comden also performed in films from time to time. She acted in Sidney Lumet's ''Garbo Talks'' (1984), in which Mr. Green also made a fleeting appearance, and James Ivory's ''Slaves of New York'' (1989). She appeared onstage in 1983 in a rare dramatic role in Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic,'' playing the mother of a footloose girl waiting for Mr. Right to come along.         In 1999 Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were saluted by their peers in a two-night program at Carnegie Hall. Elaine Stritch and Brian Stokes Mitchell were among the performers who sang numbers from the Comden-Green repertoire.         Recent Broadway revivals of their work included a 2001 production of ''Bells Are Ringing'' starring Faith Prince, which closed after a brief run, and the 2003 revival of ''Wonderful Town'' with Donna Murphy, which settled in for a long stay at the Al Hirschfeld Theater.         After Mr. Green's death in October 2002, Broadway turned out in force two months later for a memorial program at the Shubert Theater. Kevin Kline, Joel Grey, Ms. Bacall and others paid affectionate tribute to Mr. Green in song and story. At one point during her own reminiscence about him, Ms. Comden paused and said to the audience, ''It's lonely up here.'' After six decades the perfect relationship was over.         Correction:  February 26, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 24 about the Broadway lyricist Betty Comden misstated her given name at birth. Although the name Elizabeth is widely reported in reference works, she was named Basya Cohen and was never called Elizabeth, according to her memoir, ''Off Stage.'' (She chose the name Betty because Basya is pronounced Bahssie and she wanted to avoid the nickname for a cow, Bossy.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Tuesday, and this correction was further delayed for research.       
         Muriel Castanis, a sculptor whose fluidly draped figures are displayed in public places and galleries around the United States, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was lung failure, her husband, George Castanis, said.         A self-taught artist, Ms. Castanis was known in particular for her method of laying an epoxy-soaked cloth over a mannequin built of plastic foam. She would then remove the foam, leaving empty, faceless figures that were reminiscent of Greek sculpture.         In a 1990 review of her work in a joint show by nine sculptors, Vivien Raynor of The New York Times wrote, ''Just as the Invisible Man was defined by his bandages, Muriel Castanis's figures are the sum of their classical draperies.''         In 1984 Ms. Castanis made three caryatids to adorn the top of 580 California Street in San Francisco, a skyscraper and architectural landmark of the city designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee.         The youngest of six children, Ms. Castanis, born Muriel Brunner, grew up in Greenwich Village and discovered her love for art at Greenwich House, the settlement house where she would go to escape her family's hectic, crowded cold-water apartment. She attended New York's High School of Music and Art but did not start working as an artist until 1964, after 10 years as a full-time wife and mother of four.         She began by painting over subtle designs on fabric. She would smear Elmer's glue on a board with a washcloth and paste the fabric onto it. But eventually she became more intrigued by the shapes formed by the dried washcloths, and turned to sculpture.         Her sculpturing career took off after a sold-out show in 1980 at OK Harris Works of Art in Manhattan, which represented her from then on.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Castanis is survived by her four children: Thaddeus, of New York; Claudius and Augustus, of Los Angeles; and Phoebe Coombs, of Schwenksville, Pa.; and two grandchildren.         Ms. Castanis's works are featured in the Detroit Institute of Arts, Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla.; the library at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.; and the I.B.M. Corporation Atrium in Atlanta. One of her notable public artworks in New York is ''Flatbush Floogies,'' cast-bronze reliefs embedded in the walls of the Flatbush Avenue-Brooklyn College subway station.       
         Phyllis Cerf Wagner, who led a whirlwind life as the socially dynamic wife of two of New York's most prominent men but who was always proudest of collaborating with a former advertising colleague, Dr. Seuss, on a series of landmark children's books, died on Friday. She was 90.         Mrs. Wagner died at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital of complications from a fall in the bedroom of the home on East 62nd Street where she had lived since 1941, said her older son, Christopher Cerf.         A newspaper and magazine columnist, movie actress, publisher, writer of radio soap operas, advertising executive and civic fund-raiser, she lived at the center of Manhattan social life, entertaining successive generations of the city's artistic and political elite, first as the wife of the Random House co-founder Bennett Cerf, then as the wife of former Mayor Robert F. Wagner.         As a hostess and occasional confidante, she hobnobbed with the most famous people of the day, including Frank Sinatra, William Faulkner and Truman Capote.         ''In my dad's day, it was theater people mixing with book people,'' said Jonathan Cerf, her younger son. ''In Bob Wagner's day, it was political people mixing with powerful people from the private sector.''         While she was a teenager in Oklahoma City, Ginger Rogers, her cousin, invited her to move to Hollywood to try acting. Family legend has it that Ginger Rogers got her stage name because as a child, Phyllis had trouble pronouncing her real one, Virginia.         With Ginger Rogers's help, Phyllis Fraser landed small roles in several films beginning in 1932, including 1934's ''Little Men'' and 1938's ''Vivacious Lady,'' though her biggest part was opposite John Wayne in ''Winds of the Wasteland'' in 1936.         By 1939, she realized acting was not her future, so she moved to New York, joined the advertising agency of McCann Erickson and began writing radio plays. She shared a desk at the agency with an illustrator named Theodor Seuss Geisel.         Years later, after he became Dr. Seuss and, in 1957, published his breakthrough book, ''The Cat in the Hat,'' Mrs. Wagner suggested to him and his wife, Helen, that they collaborate on a series of learning-to-read books. Their new imprint, Beginner Books, eventually included classic titles like ''The Cat in the Hat Comes Back'' and ''Green Eggs and Ham.''         They worked together for more than a decade and often fought, eventually parting professionally. ''They had some disagreements which were memorable,'' Christopher Cerf said. ''They were both perfectionists and would argue about every comma that went on the page.''         Shortly after she arrived in New York in 1939, Ginger Rogers introduced Phyllis Fraser to Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker, who decided that she would make a nice match for Bennett Cerf. He introduced them at a party and they were married in 1940. Mr. Cerf died in 1971.         He encouraged her to remain professionally active, so she wrote a column for Newsday, often chronicling her encounters with celebrities. She also often took pictures for the book jackets of some of Random House's most renowned authors. Later, she wrote a household hints column for Good Housekeeping.         In the 1950s Mr. Cerf was a regular panelist on the television program ''What's My Line?'' His wife sometimes filled in as a guest panelist, and she was also a regular on the panel of an early '50s quiz program called ''Down You Go.''         A few years after her husband's death, she was introduced to former Mayor Wagner. They married in 1975. The couple lived in the same town house that the Cerfs had purchased in 1941 but made regular forays to Rome in the late '70s when Mr. Wagner was President Jimmy Carter's envoy to the Vatican.         In 1980, Mrs. Wagner co-founded the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy and worked tirelessly to raise money to revive Central Park. After Mr. Wagner's death in 1991, she returned to work, joining the advertising firm of Wells Rich Greene. Part of her job was to organize elaborate parties to attract clients.         ''My mother was an incredibly gifted hostess, wonderful at putting people together,'' Jonathan Cerf said. ''She did it with enthusiasm. But the thing that always made her proudest was those books that helped so many children learn to read.''

         Bebe Moore Campbell, a best-selling novelist known for her empathetic treatment of the difficult, intertwined and occasionally surprising relationship between the races, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 56.         The cause was complications of brain cancer, said Linda Wharton-Boyd, a longtime friend.         Along with writers like Terry McMillan, Ms. Campbell was part of the first wave of black novelists who made the lives of upwardly mobile black people a routine subject for popular fiction. Straddling the divide between literary and mass-market novels, Ms. Campbell's work explored not only the turbulent dance between blacks and whites but also the equally fraught relationship between men and women.         Throughout her work, Ms. Campbell sought to counter prevailing stereotypes of black people as socially and economically marginal. Though critics occasionally faulted her characters as two-dimensional, her novels were known for their crossover appeal, read by blacks and whites alike.         Often called on by the news media to discuss race relations, Ms. Campbell was for years a familiar presence on television and radio. With the publication of her most recent novel, ''72 Hour Hold'' (Knopf, 2005), she also became a visible spokeswoman on mental-health issues. The novel, about bipolar disorder, was inspired by the experience of a family member, Ms. Campbell said.         Originally a schoolteacher and later a journalist, Ms. Campbell made her mark as a writer of fiction with her first novel, ''Your Blues Ain't Like Mine'' (Putnam), published in 1992. Rooted in the story of Emmett Till, the book tells of a black Chicago youth killed by a white man in Mississippi in 1955. After the murderer is acquitted at trial, the narrative follows his increasing dissolution.         ''I wanted to give racism a face,'' Ms. Campbell said in an interview with The New York Times Book Review in 1992. ''African-Americans know about racism, but I don't think we really know the causes. I decided it's first of all a family problem.''         Reviewing the novel in The Book Review, Clyde Edgerton wrote: ''By showing lives lived, and not explaining ideas, Ms. Campbell does what good storytellers do -- she puts in by leaving out.''         Ms. Campbell's other novels, all published by G. P. Putnam's Sons, are ''Brothers and Sisters'' (1994), written in the wake of the Los Angeles riots of 1992; ''Singing in the Comeback Choir'' (1998), about a black television producer feeling cut off from her roots; and ''What You Owe Me'' (2001), about the friendship between two women, one African-American, the other a Jewish Holocaust survivor, in the 1940's.         Elizabeth Bebe Moore was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 18, 1950, to parents who divorced when she was very young. Bebe spent each school year in Philadelphia with her mother, grandmother and aunt -- strong, upright women she collectively called ''the Bosoms'' -- who set her on a course of study, discipline and staunch middle-class respectability.         She spent summers in North Carolina with her father, who had been paralyzed in an automobile accident. There, she was enveloped in a heady world of beer, laughter and cigar smoke. She documented her contrasting lives in her memoir, ''Sweet Summer: Growing Up With and Without My Dad'' (Putnam, 1989).         After earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of Pittsburgh in 1971, Ms. Campbell taught school in Atlanta for several years before embarking on a career as a freelance journalist. Her first book was a work of nonfiction, ''Successful Women, Angry Men: Backlash in the Two-Career Marriage'' (Random House, 1986).         She also wrote two picture books for children, ''Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry'' (Putnam, 2003; illustrated by E. B. Lewis); and ''Stompin' at the Savoy'' (Philomel, 2006; illustrated by Richard Yarde).         Ms. Campbell's first marriage, to Tiko Campbell, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Ellis Gordon Jr., whom she married in 1984; her mother, Doris Moore of Los Angeles; a daughter from her first marriage, Maia Campbell of Los Angeles; a stepson, Ellis Gordon III of Mitchellville, Md.; and two grandchildren.         Despite the subject matter of her books, Ms. Campbell expressed hope about the future of American race relations. In an interview with The New York Times in 1995, she described her motivation for writing ''Brothers and Sisters,'' the story of the friendship between a black banker and her white colleague.         ''It was my attempt to bridge a racial gap,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''That's the story that never gets told: how many of us really like each other, respect each other.''       
         Jane Hodgson, a prominent abortion rights advocate who in a highly publicized test case in 1970 became the only doctor in the United States to be convicted of illegally performing an abortion in a hospital, died on Oct. 23 at her home in Rochester, Minn. She was 91.         Dr. Hodgson's death was confirmed by her family.         Until January 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, abortion was illegal in most states. Among them was Minnesota, where Dr. Hodgson had a busy practice as an obstetrician and gynecologist.         In April 1970, Dr. Hodgson agreed to perform an abortion in order to challenge Minnesota law. At the time, abortion was permitted in the state only to save the woman's life.         The patient, a married mother of three, had contracted German measles early in her fourth pregnancy. Though the woman's life was not in danger, the disease carried a high risk for birth defects. Dr. Hodgson performed the abortion and was arrested shortly afterward. Convicted in November 1970, she was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a year's probation.         Dr. Hodgson's sentence was suspended pending appeal; after the Roe decision, her conviction was overturned. She served no jail time.         In later years, Dr. Hodgson remained a public champion of abortion rights, speaking widely on the subject and founding several reproductive health care clinics. She also lent her name to several abortion-related lawsuits, notably Hodgson v. Minnesota, which challenged a state law requiring both parents to be notified before a minor could have an abortion.         Ruling in the case in 1990, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Minnesota law with a 5-to-4 vote, finding it constitutional because of its provision allowing patients to seek permission from a judge instead of from their parents.         There was little in Dr. Hodgson's background that would mark her as a crusader. For the first decades of her career, she refused to perform abortions, though a steady stream of patients begged her to in whispers. But, as she said later in interviews, she grew increasingly troubled by watching women come to her with complications from botched abortions obtained elsewhere.         Jane Elizabeth Hodgson was born on Jan. 23, 1915, in Crookston, Minn. Her father was a country doctor, and she often accompanied him on rounds. She earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Carleton College in 1934 and an M.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1939. After advanced training at the Mayo Clinic, she established her practice in St. Paul.         In 1940, Dr. Hodgson married Frank Quattlebaum, a vascular surgeon; he died in 2004. She is survived by their two daughters, Gretchen Banks of Edina, Minn., and Nancy Burke of Golden Valley, Minn.; and three grandchildren.         When she was well into her 70's, Dr. Hodgson continued to make the 150-mile weekly trip from St. Paul to Duluth, Minn., to perform abortions at a clinic she had helped establish there.         ''I think in many ways I've been lucky to have been part of this,'' Dr. Hodgson said in the book ''Doctors of Conscience'' (Beacon Press, 1995) by Carole Joffe. ''If I hadn't gotten involved, I would have gone through life probably being perfectly satisfied to go to the medical society parties and it would have been very, very dull. I would have been bored silly.''       
         Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, who, with a younger brother, wrote ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' the account of their growing up in a family of 12 children that led to several movies of the same name, died on Saturday in Fresno, Calif. She was 98 and lived in Reedley, Calif.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Charles E. Carey.         ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' which became a best seller when it was published in 1948, beguiled readers with the autobiographical details of the Gilbreths, a family in the 1920's dominated by Dad but discreetly monitored by Mother. The book, replicated in numerous editions since its publication, is a testament to the intelligence, energy and eccentricity of the Gilbreth parents, who ran the family's management consulting firm.         The business focused on the science of motion study and industrial efficiencies. Frank Bunker Gilbreth believed that the factory management principles he espoused to his clients could also be applied to his family of six girls and six boys, produced in 17 years; Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who had a Ph.D. from Brown University (earned around 1915, while she had several children at home), was an industrial psychologist and an engineering expert. Mr. Gilbreth died of a heart attack in 1924 at 55, the day after Mrs. Carey graduated from high school; his wife died in 1972 at 93.         Mrs. Carey's brother Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. received first billing as a co-author, and the book's narrative voice is decidedly unified, never betraying who wrote what. Nevertheless, Mrs. Carey wrote other books (as did her brother, who died in 2001), including ''Jumping Jupiter,'' ''Rings Around Us'' and ''Giddy Moment.''         The charming havoc of ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' found a wide audience just after World War II. Mrs. Carey and her brother mined a rich vein of humorous and quirky material from the Gilbreth clan. Mrs. Carey, the third child, and Frank, the fifth, plumbed what appeared to be the best of living in a brood that size.         An outing in their Pierce-Arrow, with Dad at the wheel and babies tucked in the front seat near Mother in the days before seat belts, felt ''like a back somersault off the high diving board.'' The household was described as ''organized confusion,'' resembling a ''newspaper on election night.'' In their house in Montclair, N.J., servants took care of cooking and gardening, although every child was assigned to look after a younger sibling and performed other tasks.         Given their father's penchant for order, ''nothing was considered more of a sin in our house than wasted time and motions,'' the authors wrote. Dad, though a benevolent soul, ran a household that was above all else driven to learn. Language records were played in the bathrooms while the children washed; they absorbed French and German that was later recited at the dinner table. Mealtime could be as intense as a board meeting, since ''no one could talk unless the subject was of general interest.'' Practical jokes, centered around Dad, defused the tension.         Toward the book's end, Ern, as Mrs. Carey was called, briefly enjoyed some of the spotlight when she and her older sister, Anne (who died in 1987), began dating in high school. With her wide face and compelling gaze, she attracted many suitors. But Dad had a little trouble with this, referring to one fellow as a ''simpleton with pimples in his voice.'' That didn't stop another boy from climbing a cherry tree near Ern's bedroom to spy on her, inciting her to label him a ''sneaking Peeping Tom.''         Hollywood wasted little time, spiriting ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' into a movie by 1950, starring Myrna Loy as Mother and Clifton Webb as Dad. It was remade and modernized in 2003 with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents, with ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2'' appearing in 2005. The Gilbreth brother-and-sister team also wrote ''Belles on Their Toes,'' a 1950 sequel that was turned into a movie in 1952. In July of this year Mrs. Carey finished writing a memoir but did not want to talk about it prematurely for fear of ''bad luck.''         Mrs. Carey graduated from Smith College in 1929, with a degree in English. She worked as a department-store buyer and in management in New York City for 14 years, marrying Charles E. Carey, who died in 1986, and having two children. Her own mother eventually lived with Mrs. Carey, after a long career of mothering, teaching, writing and consulting. Mrs. Carey also gathered her mother's extensive papers and photographs to donate them to Smith College.         Mrs. Carey is survived by two brothers, Frederick Gilbreth of Larchmont, N.Y., and Robert Gilbreth, of Franklin, N.H.; her children Charles E. Carey of Livermore, Calif., and Lillian Barley of Riverdale, Calif.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Rose Mattus, who with her husband, Reuben, turned a family-owned ice cream business in the Bronx into a national brand with the invented name H√§agen-Dazs, died Tuesday in Westwood, N.J. She was 90 and lived in Cresskill, N.J.         The death was confirmed by Brian McNamara of Gutterman & Musicant Funeral Directors in Hackensack, N.J.         Around 1960, while sitting on their couch in the Bronx, Mr. and Mrs. Mattus fabricated the foreign-sounding name. It was Mr. Mattus's idea to include a map of Denmark on the carton and to put an umlaut over the first ''a'' in H√§agen, even though no umlaut is used in Danish.         In the company's early years, Mrs. Mattus, the company's controller, built the business by going to bodegas and grocery stores to offer free samples. By 1983, when H√§agen-Dazs was acquired by Pillsbury for $70 million, the company had a strong presence in supermarkets, a coast-to-coast string of franchise ice cream shops and sales of about $115 million a year. It is now owned by Nestl√©.         ''Rose was a true partner of her husband in operating the business, making decisions,'' said Roy Sloane, the company's advertising manager until 1987. ''Reuben was a true dairy expert, a bug about quality. Rose basically ran the business, holding the company together and making it possible for a dreamer like Reuben to be successful.''         Mr. Mattus died in 1994.         Rose Vesel Mattus was born in Poland on Nov. 23, 1916. She arrived in the United States in 1921; her future husband emigrated from Poland later the same year. They met while teenagers on the streets of Brownsville, Brooklyn.         Mrs. Mattus is survived by 2 daughters, Doris Hurley and Natalie Salamore; 2 brothers, Edward and Robert Vesel; 5 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.         By the mid-1920's, Mr. Mattus and his widowed mother were making ice cream on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx; he delivered it to neighborhood stores by horse-drawn wagon.         Mr. and Mrs. Mattus were married in 1936, and soon after she began working for the family business. The company was profitable for decades, but burst onto the national scene only after the new name was concocted.         At the time, most supermarket ice cream was made with artificial flavoring and nonfat dry milk, while H√§agen-Dazs used egg yolks and real cream, as well as ingredients like Belgian chocolate, vanilla beans from Madagascar and coffee from Colombia.         ''Eventually, we were buying entire valleys of strawberries in Oregon,'' Mr. Sloane said.         Correction:  January 29, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Dec. 1 about Rose Mattus, who with her husband created H√§agen-Dazs Ice Cream, misidentified the company that owns the brand. It is General Mills, not Nestl√©. (General Mills has licensed Nestl√© to sell some of its brands in the United States and Canada.)       
         Anne Rogers Clark, a commanding figure in the world of show dogs who won renown at the Westminster Dog Show as a handler, a judge and a breeder, died Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., at the home of a friend. She was 77 and a longtime resident of Greenwood, Del.         The cause was kidney failure associated with colon cancer, said Thomas H. Bradley III, the chairman of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.         At 6 feet 2 inches, Mrs. Clark was an imposing and instantly recognizable presence in the show ring. For six decades, she was a fixture at Westminster, and she holds many of its records. Among them, she was the first woman to win best in show as a professional handler, and she ranked second among all handlers with three best in shows.         She also shared the record for most judging appearances at Westminster, with 22. She would have broken that record in February, when she was scheduled to be judge of the terrier group at Madison Square Garden.         A walking encyclopedia on the standards of more than 400 breeds worldwide, she was one of only two dozen people licensed to judge all 165 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.         She had more than a deep knowledge of dogs, though; she had a way with them.         ''Dogs responded to her,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''As a judge, she was authoritative and friendly. Some dogs who were shown to her many times would even recognize her. They would wag their tails when they saw her.''         Born in 1929 in Flushing, Queens, Anne Rogers was the great-granddaughter of a 19th-century mayor of New York, Philip Hone, and a second-generation dog person. Her mother, who ran a kennel in Pound Ridge, N.Y., started a successful dog department at Abercrombie & Fitch, then opened a grooming service in Manhattan called Dogs Inc.         Turning down a scholarship to the veterinary school at Cornell, Anne Rogers joined her mother's business after high school, then took to the show ring as a handler. She won her first best in show at Westminster in 1956, handling a toy poodle, Ch. Wilbur White Swan, the first dog from the toy group to win top honors there.         She turned to judging in 1967, two years after retiring as a handler. Although she said she was possibly the slowest judge in American Kennel Club history during her first few years, by 1973 she had worked her way to Westminster to judge the toy group. She judged the best in show in 1978.         Mrs. Clark was also a winner at Westminster as a breeder. She and her husband, James, captured non-sporting-group honors with their standard poodle Ch. Rimskittle Ruffian in 1980. In 2002, her miniature poodle Ch. Surrey Spice Girl, which she bred with Barbara Furbush and her prot√©g√© Kaz Hosaka, won best in show.         Mrs. Clark's activities extended beyond Westminster. Until recently, she spent most weekends traveling around the country judging at specialty shows. She was a president of the Poodle Club of America and the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America, co-wrote ''The International Encyclopedia of Dogs'' and published a compilation of her monthly columns for Dogs in Review magazine called ''Annie on Dogs!''         Mrs. Clark, whose husband died in 1991, had no children and leaves no survivors. She did hope to leave a legacy in the world of registered purebreds.         ''I have to get through to you that I adore to judge,'' she was quoted as saying in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. ''I look forward to walking in the ring. I feel when a class comes in, it's like a blank canvas, and if I'm lucky, I can paint on this canvas what the breed should be.''       
         Rosie Lee Tompkins, a renowned African-American quiltmaker whose use of dazzling color and vivid geometric forms made her work internationally acclaimed despite her vehement efforts to remain completely unknown, was found dead on Friday at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 70.         The cause of death had not been determined, Eli Leon, a quilt scholar and longtime friend, said yesterday.         In everyday life, Ms. Tompkins was Effie Mae Howard, a fiercely private woman who lived quietly in Richmond and worked as a practical nurse. As Rosie Lee Tompkins, the pseudonym under which her quilts were shown, she was exhibited, much to her chagrin, in prestigious museums and galleries in the United States and Japan.         Lavishly praised by critics, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Oakland Museum in California. Her work was included in the Whitney Biennial in 2002.         Writing in The New York Times the same year, Roberta Smith reviewed an exhibition of Ms. Tompkins's work at the Peter Blum Gallery in Manhattan: ''Unerring and intuitive in their sense of color, shape and scale, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are formidably joyful visual events that ignore the usual boundaries between cultures, histories and mediums.''         Born and raised in Arkansas, Ms. Tompkins was heir to the long tradition of black Southern quilting, a form of folk art whose best-known practitioners include the women of Gee's Bend, Ala. Their work, vibrant geometric quilts made from whatever scraps came to hand, became famous after it was shown at the Whitney in 2002 and 2003.         Ms. Tompkins's quilts are even more radical. Made of massed, vivid patches, they exude a barely controlled geometric anarchy. Stripes can be thrillingly off kilter. Patterns shift and fracture. The result, riotous mosaics in cloth, has been likened by critics to Modernist painting.         In traditional quilts, the fabric of choice is cotton. Ms. Tompkins's quilts can also include cut-up feed sacks, rayon, velvet, polyester, fake fur, wool and silk. Each material reflects light differently; in combination, they make her work look like something viewed through a prism.         Ms. Tompkins was born Effie Mae Martin on Sept. 6, 1936, in rural southeast Arkansas. (Effie Mae Howard was her married name.) One of 15 children, she picked cotton and helped her mother make quilts for the family. She left school before starting high school, and in 1958 settled in California.         There, she took classes in practical nursing and went to work in nursing homes. Around 1980, Ms. Tompkins started to quilt in earnest, producing hundreds of patchwork items of various sizes, showing them to almost no one outside her family.         She arrived at many of her designs -- abstract, improvisational and filled with deep personal significance -- after private prayer. Ms. Tompkins believed herself to be merely an instrument, Mr. Leon said. It was God, she felt, who designed the quilts and guided her hand.         She also believed that her phone was tapped. Sometimes she heard voices. She covered one wall of her bedroom with hangings, thick with appliqu√©d crosses, which she hoped would still them. They did not.         Even as her quilts gained renown, Ms. Tompkins revealed her true identity to only a handful of trusted associates, among them Mr. Leon, the quilt scholar. She never attended her out-of-town exhibitions. If a friend managed to drag her to a local exhibition of her work, she quietly slipped into the gallery anonymously.         ''Something she told me once was that despite the fact that nobody knew who she was, she felt like she had no privacy,'' Mr. Leon said by telephone yesterday. ''She felt like she lived in a glass house and people were watching her.''         Ms. Tompkins, who for deeply held reasons of her own refused to sign documents, rarely sold her work. Those quilts she did sell went for tens of thousands of dollars apiece, Mr. Leon said.         She was also fiercely circumspect about disclosing the names and whereabouts of family members. Mr. Leon was equally circumspect yesterday. It is known that Ms. Tompkins was married and divorced twice; survivors include her mother; several children and stepchildren; and many siblings, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.         A one-woman show of Ms. Tompkins's work is scheduled for next year at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vt., from May 20 to Oct. 31.         Correction:  December 8, 2006, Friday  An obituary on Wednesday about Rosie Lee Tompkins, a reclusive maker of improvisational quilts, misstated her response to having her work exhibited in museums and galleries in the United States and abroad. Although Ms. Tompkins always worked under a pseudonym to preserve her anonymity, rarely attended her own exhibitions and agreed to sell few of her quilts, she was nonetheless pleased -- not chagrined -- to have her work shown, Eli Leon, a quilt scholar and longtime friend, told The Times on Wednesday.         Correction:  December 13, 2006, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary last Wednesday about Rosie Lee Tompkins, a renowned quiltmaker, misstated the name of the museum that has her work in its permanent collection. It is the Oakland Museum of California, not the Oakland Museum.
