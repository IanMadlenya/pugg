         Katharine Homer Fryer, an artist, teacher and writer who devoted much of her later life to the mentally disturbed, died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 89 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         At her death, she was president of the Schizophrenia Foundation of New York, which provides information on alternative treatments for the illness. She headed the foundation since 1969, shortly after its creation.         She also was director emeritus of the Fryer Research Center, an outpatient clinic in the former Murray Hill Hospital on East 40th Street in Manhattan. It offers a biochemical-nutritional approach to emotional and mental conditions, like schizophrenia and depression, as well as physical disorders.         She founded the nonprofit center in 1971 to help people who could not otherwise afford such treatment, and remained its director until a few months ago. Her daughter and successor, Dr. Kathy Fryer, estimated yesterday that the center had served more than 10,000 people and their families.         Mrs. Fryer's dedication stemmed in large part from living with mental illness in her immediate family. One of her five daughters, Barbara, committed suicide in 1968 at age 31, after spending 10 years in a succession of treatments for schizophrenia.         In a new book, ''The Story of Barbara,'' Mrs. Fryer wrote of her daughter's condition, which might have had a different outcome with the alternative treatments for schizophrenia emerging then. The book is to be published by Rivercross Publishing later this year.         An earlier book was ''Kathy: A Mother's True Story of a Young Girl's Fight to Regain Health'' (Dutton, 1956). It told of her daughter Kathy's successful emergence from a mysterious ailment that befell her at 13 and a mother's years of searching for the right diagnosis and cure.         Mrs. Fryer wrote of the ''unexpected, miraculous'' deliverance when Kathy's condition was recognized and swiftly overcome. It proved to be a complex case of severe thyroid deficiency aggravated by psychological problems.         Mrs. Fryer published a second book in 1994, ''Till Death Do Us Part,'' on life with her husband, Dr. Douglas Fryer, a pioneer in industrial psychology and a prolific author, whom she married in 1934. A former head of the Department of Psychology at New York University, he died in 1960.         Katharine Homer was born in New York City to two well-known parents, Sidney Homer, a composer of chamber music and songs, and Louise Homer, a Metropolitan Opera contralto. In the 1920's, she studied piano, singing and painting under distinguished teachers at the Curtis Institute of Music, Mannes College of Music and the Arts League in New York, and at l'Ecole Julienne in Paris.         For several years, she traveled as her mother's accompanist before touring on her own as a solo pianist and with chamber music groups. She exhibited her paintings in New York and Paris.         In 1932, she organized a 50-member girls' choir in Scarsdale, N.Y., and directed it until 1951. She also organized and directed an adult choir in Rye, N.Y., in the 1960's.         All along, until her work at the foundation and center became a primary occupation, she privately taught piano, singing and painting. She also served stints as a piano teacher at the Manhattan School of Music in the 1930's, and more recently at the Brearley School.         Besides Dr. Fryer, a Manhattan resident, she is survived by three other daughters, Dr. Judith Shedden, Anne Eddis and Dr. Sarah Leibowitz, all of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Laura Nyro, the New York-born singer and songwriter whose impassioned, iconoclastic music exploded pop song conventions in a feverish search for emotional truth, died on Tuesday at her home in Danbury, Conn. She was 49.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Elizabeth Rush, her business representative.         Along with Joni Mitchell, Ms. Nyro (pronounced Nero) was a pioneer in the confessional, free-form school of songwriting that grew out of 1960's folk music, especially the work of Bob Dylan. A trained pianist, she had a kaleidoscopic musical sensibility that fused elements of folk, soul, gospel and Broadway tradition into intensely introspective songs that transcended easy stylistic categorization.         With her uninhibited, note-bending vocal wail, she also helped introduce the rhythm-and-blues-influenced style known as ''blue-eyed soul,'' so named because it was popularized by white singers imitating black role models. And her live concerts were fervent affairs in which the dark-haired, dark-eyed singer, exotically gowned and surrounded by roses, performed with a transported intensity.         As a recording artist, Ms. Nyro never had a gold album or a hit single, but many of her songs were hits for others. And her albums, especially her 1968 song suite ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession'' (Columbia), a sometimes impenetrable mosaic of fragments, reflections and fantasies with a Southern gospel feel,  was one of the most influential pop recordings of the late 1960's. Among the many artists inspired by Ms. Nyro's eclecticism and poetic sensibility were Rickie Lee Jones, Kate Bush, Wendy Waldman, Jane Siberry, Teena Marie, Suzanne Vega,  Toni Childs, Tori Amos and Paula Cole.         Among Ms. Nyro's biggest hits for others were the songs ''And When I Die'' (recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary and Blood, Sweat and Tears),  ''Wedding Bell Blues'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Sweet Blindness'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Stoned Soul Picnic'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Eli's Coming'' (Three Dog Night) and ''Stoney End'' (Barbra Streisand).         Ms. Nyro was born Laura Nigro in the Bronx on Oct. 18, 1947. Her father was a jazz trumpeter who practiced for hours at home. An undisciplined child prodigy, Ms. Nyro began writing songs at age 8 and later attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. As a teen-ager she experimented with psychedelic drugs, absorbed musical influences as far-ranging as Bob Dylan, John Coltrane and Debussy, and at 18 made her  first extended club appearance at the Hungry i coffeehouse in San Francisco.         In 1966, Verve/Folkways released her debut album, ''More Than a New Discovery,'' a remarkably sophisticated collection of original songs that Columbia later purchased and reissued in 1973 as ''The First Songs.'' Widely admired, it led to an invitation to perform at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, where her introspective music proved so out of place amid the high-powered rock of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin that she was shouted off the stage.         Within the year, however, several of Ms. Nyro's songs had become hits for others, and she was signed by Columbia. In March 1968, the label released ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession,'' her autobiographical album about a young woman's spiritual journey from childhood to maturity. With its abrupt changes of tempo and style and its fiercely emotional singing, the record was unlike anything that had been heard in pop music, and it laid the groundwork for a female-dominated genre of quirky, reflective songwriting that continues to this day.         On her next two albums, ''New York Tendaberry'' (1969) and ''Christmas and the Beads of Sweat'' (1970), Ms. Nyro retreated somewhat from the boundary-breaking experimentalism of ''Eli'' and settled into her characteristic style, which remained eclectic but had its strongest roots in the Philadelphia pop-soul sound of songwriters like Thom Bell, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, and Todd Rundgren. Her 1971 album, ''Gonna Take a Miracle,'' a collaboration with the rhythm-and-blues group LaBelle, was a tribute to New York street music of an earlier era that featured  jubilant remakes of old doo-wop and Motown favorites.         Never comfortable in the limelight, Ms. Nyro married and retreated from the music business to lead a secluded life for the next three years in a fishing village in Massachusetts. After the marriage ended in divorce, she returned to recording, putting out ''Smile'' (1976), her first album in four years. Here, and in her later  Columbia albums, ''Nested'' (1978), ''Mother's Spiritual'' (1984) and ''Walk the Dog and Light the Light'' (1993), her songs gave increasingly direct expression to the pantheism that had always lurked in her writing. But if her later songs exalted pacifism, feminism, motherhood and animal rights, the emotional turmoil of old was never far from the surface.         Ms. Nyro personally selected all 34 of the songs on a recently released two-disk retrospective of her work, ''The Best of Laura Nyro: Stoned Soul Picnic'' (Columbia/Legacy).         She is survived by a son, Gil Bianchini, and her companion, Maria Desiderio.       
         Eugenie M. Anderson, who in 1949 became the first woman appointed a United States Ambassador, died on Monday at her home in Red Wing, Minn. She was 87.         Mrs. Anderson had been active in the Democratic Party on the state and national levels when she was appointed Ambassador to Denmark  by President Truman.         Her interest in international affairs had been stirred by a trip to Europe in 1937, where in Germany she first saw a ''totalitarian state in action,'' as she recalled.         On her return she spoke frequently on foreign affairs on behalf of the League of Women Voters at a time when much of the Middle West was strongly committed to isolationist policies.         She joined the Democratic Party in part to oppose Republican isolationists in her election district and worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in the successful effort to eliminate a Communist faction within the Minnesota party. That effort culminated in the Democratic-Farmer Labor Party fusion in 1944.         She took part in the establishment of Americans for Democratic Action, formed by the party's anti-Communist liberal wing in 1947. She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948, a National Committeewoman, and a campaigner for the re-election of President Truman.         ''She was a prime force in moving along a good Democratic Party,'' said Orville Freeman, the former Minnesota Governor.         After her service in Denmark, President Kennedy appointed her in 1962 to head the American legation in Bulgaria, which was then a Communist ally of the Soviet Union.         The Government of Prime Minister Todor Zhivkov repeatedly made life uncomfortable for her mission, to the point of organizing a rock-throwing demonstration against the legation.         When the Bulgarian police tried to prevent her aides from passing out literature at the American display in the annual Plovdiv fair, Mrs. Anderson grabbed a handful of leaflets and distributed them herself.         She retired from the post as Ambassador in 1964.         President Johnson appointed Mrs. Anderson to represent the United States on the United Nations Trusteeship Council and a year later she served on the United Nations Committee for Decolonization.         Helen Eugenie Moore was born on May 26, 1909, in Adair, Iowa, one of five children of Rev. Ezekial A. Moore, a Methodist minister, and his wife, FloraBelle.         She concentrated in music as a student, and attended the Julliard School in New York; her original hope was to become a concert pianist.         She is survived by her husband of 67 years, John Pierce Anderson, an artist; a son, Dr. Hans P. Anderson of LaCrosse, Wis.; a daughter, Johanna A. Ghei of Madison, Wis.; six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
