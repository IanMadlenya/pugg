        Elizabeth Knowlton, a mountain climber who in 1932 became the first woman to climb as high as 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, died of heart disease Sunday at the Ocean Manor Nursing Home in Scituate, Mass., where she lived for the last four years. She was 93 years old and a longtime resident of Cambridge,         Elizabeth Knowlton, a mountain climber who in 1932 became the first woman to climb as high as 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, died of heart disease Sunday at the Ocean Manor Nursing Home in Scituate, Mass., where she lived for the last four years. She was 93 years old and a longtime resident of Cambridge, Mass.         Miss Knowlton attained world fame when she was the only woman in a German-American expedition that attempted to climb the 27,660-foot-high Nanga Parbat in Kashmir, the seventh-highest peak in the world. The men in charge of the climb would not let her continue beyond the 20,000-foot level.         Miss Knowlton, who was 37 years old at the time, wrote periodic dispatches to The New York Times on the four-month-long assault, which ended in failure because of heavy snowstorms. She later wrote an account of the expedition in her book ''The Naked Mountain,'' published by Putnam in 1933. Frustration and Futility         After recounting the two years of planning for the ascent, the work that went into preparation in Munich, the long journey by ship, rail, truck, pack horses and afoot, and the two and a half months of the actual climb, she summed up the futile effort in these words:         ''And the mountain, scornful of our puny efforts, had carelessly every day or two scattered a few snowflakes on us, and then finally thrown a whole handful. And we could do nothing against it. Everything was ended. The effort was over. Defeat - frustration - futility.''         Miss Knowlton, a native of Springfield, Mass., was a gradaute of Vassar and received a master's degree in English from Radcliffe. She began climbing in the White Mountains of New Hampshire when she was 7 years old. Fluent in German, French, Italian and Spanish, she was at home among explorers in the many expeditions in which she took part in the Alps and in Mexico and Canada.         After World War II she took part in the first two ascents of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. She was in her 60's when she made her last climbs in the Nepalese foothills.         Miss Knowlton was a member of the Explorers Club, the Appalachian Mountain Club and the American Alpine Club.         She is survived by a nephew, Marcus P. Knowlton of Princeton, N.J.         Correction:  February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late City Final Edition         An obituary on Friday about Elizabeth Knowlton, a mountain climber, misstated an accomplishment in her career. Miss Knowlton climbed peaks in the Himalayas more than 20,000 feet high in 1932, but she was not the first woman to do so; Fanny Bullock Workman of Worcester, Mass., achieved the feat before World War I.

Arvia MacKaye Ege, a poet and a founder of the Rudolph Steiner Educational and Farming Association, died Wednesday at her home in Hillsdale, N.Y. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Ege, daughter of the playwright Percy MacKaye, wrote ''The Secret Iron of the Heart,'' published in 1982, and ''The Battle for the Sunlight: A Modern Legend,'' which was reissued in 1983, both by the Admonis Press. Another book, ''The Power of the Impossible,'' is scheduled for release this year.         In 1972, Mrs. Ege founded the Rudolph Steiner Association in Ghent, N.Y. It is the umbrella organization for the Hawthorne Valley Farm, a dairy farm; the Hawthorne Valley School; the Hawthorne Valley Visiting Students Program, an environmental center, and the Hawthorne Valley Artists and Artisans. All are in the Hudson Valley near Hillsdale.         Surviving are a brother, Robert MacKaye of Spring Valley, N.Y., and a sister, Christy Barnes of Hillsdale.       
        Emily Kimbrough, an author, lecturer and former radio commentator, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had suffered from lung cancer, said a longtime friend, Sophia Yarnall Jacobs.         Emily Kimbrough, an author, lecturer and former radio commentator, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had suffered from lung cancer, said a longtime friend, Sophia Yarnall Jacobs.         Miss Kimbrough was the co-author, with Cornelia Otis Skinner, of ''Our Hearts Were Young and Gay,'' a reminiscence of her travels in Europe during the early 1920's. The book, published in 1942, was popular despite a review from Orville Prescott, then the critic for The New York Times, who wrote: ''There is a noticeable trace of mild humor to 'Our Hearts Were Young and Gay,' but it is very mild indeed, about as tasty as junket or cornstarch pudding. Why it should be a co-selection for December by the Book-of-the-Month Club is a dark mystery.''         It was made into a movie starring Diana Lynn and Gail Russell. Miss Kimbrough wrote a sequel, ''We Followed Our Hearts to Hollywood,'' published in 1943.         A native of Muncie, Ind., Miss Kimbrough graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1921. Her first job was as a copywriter at Marshall Field & Company in Chicago, where she became editor of a publication, ''Fashions of the Hour.'' She joined The Ladies Home Journal as fashion editor, and was managing editor before she resigned to work as a freelance writer and lecturer. Joined WCBS Radio         Her articles appeared in The New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly. Her subsequent books, including ''Forty Plus and Fancy Free,'' ''How Dear to My Heart'' and ''Water Water Everywhere.''         In 1952, she joined WCBS Radio, where she wrote her own 25-minute daily program.         Miss Kimbrough was also active in civil rights with the National Urban League during the 1960's.         She was married in 1927 to John Wrench, and was divorced several years later.         She is survived by her daughters, Margaret Wrench Kuhn of Westport, Conn., and Alis Wrench McCurdy, of Cam Cape Sebastian, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Helene Eliat van de Velde, a psychologist and writer who elucidated Freudian insights into the literary portrayal of human behavior, died of cardio-respiratory failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old.         Helene Eliat van de Velde, a psychologist and writer who elucidated Freudian insights into the literary portrayal of human behavior, died of cardio-respiratory failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old.         Born in Berlin, Mrs. van de Velde moved in cultural circles in Berlin and in Paris, where she settled in the 1930's. She wrote several short stories and a novel, ''Sheba Visits Solomon,'' published in America by Viking Press in 1932.         The book, which dealt with the legendary visit of Balkis, the Queen of Sheba, to King Solomon, was assessed in The New York Times Book Review as ''a gay, amusing, witty, sophisticated and exceptionally shrewd novel'' casting an unorthodox light on the meeting between the virgin Queen and the imposing monarch.         Mrs. van de Velde trained in psychoanalysis under two prominent pupils of Sigmund Freud, Karl Abrams and Hans Sachs, before coming to the United States during World War II. Later she returned to attend the Institute of Applied Psychology in Zurich under Rudolf Brun. In 1954 she began her practice in New York under the supervision of Theodore Reik, founder of the Psychological Association for Psychoanalyasis.         She is survived by her daughter, France-Helene Weindling of Manhattan, and a grandchild.       
        Marie Syrkin, an author, editor and teacher who was active in the Zionist cause for many decades, died of cancer Wednesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89 years old and lived in Santa Monica.         Marie Syrkin, an author, editor and teacher who was active in the Zionist cause for many decades, died of cancer Wednesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89 years old and lived in Santa Monica.         Miss Syrkin was born in Bern, Switzerland, the daughter of Dr. Nachman Syrkin, a prominent Socialist Zionist theoretician. She came with her family to the United States in 1908 and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Cornell University, then taught high school in New York City. Her first book, ''Your School, Your Children,'' published in 1944, was an impassioned plea for schools to propagandize democratic values instead of remaining neutral in the war of ideas.         In 1950 Miss Syrkin was named associate professor of English at Brandeis University, where she taught until her retirement in 1966 as professor of the humanities.         Her involvement with Zionism dated to the early 1930's, when she was a translator of Yiddish poetry and a commentator on Jewish life in the United States. She was a founder of the Labor Zionist journal Jewish Frontier in 1934 and for a quarter century beginning in 1948 was its editor in chief. Her most recent article for the magazine appears in its current issue. Golda Meir Biography         In the 1940's Miss Syrkin made the first of many trips to Palestine - later Israel - to interview survivors of the Holocaust and to gather material for her 1947 book, ''Blessed Is the Match: The Story of Jewish Resistance,'' which chronicled the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto and other revolts against the Nazis.         A longtime friend and associate of Golda Meir, who was also a schoolteacher, Miss Syrkin published ''Golda Meir: Woman With a Cause'' - a three-volume biography of the Israeli Prime Minister - in 1964. She was a prolific writer for such periodicals as Midstream, Commentary, The Saturday Review, The New York Times Magazine and The New Republic. Her final volume was a collection of essays from those and other magazines entitled ''The State of the Jews,'' published in 1980.         From 1965 to 1969 Miss Syrkin was on the executive body of the World Zionist Movement and during that period was honorary president of the Labor Zionist Movement in the United States.         Miss Syrkin was married to the poet Charles Reznikoff, who died in 1976.         She is survived by a son, David Bodansky of Seattle; a sister, Zivia Wurtele of Santa Monica; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         It was Mrs. Tuchman's fourth book, ''The Guns of August,'' a study of the background and beginning of World War I, that made her a celebrity after it came out in 1962, winning reviewers' salutes, a durable niche on best-seller lists and her first Pulitzer Prize.         The second Pulitzer came for ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45.'' The 1971 biography of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, a hard-driving American officer who played a major role in China during World War II, was combined with a history of modern China. Her other books included ''The Zimmermann Telegram,'' ''The Proud Tower'' and ''A Distant Mirror.'' Latest Book a Best Seller         Her most recent book, ''The First Salute,'' sets the American Revolution in international perspective. It has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 17 weeks, and last week was No. 9.         Born into a New York family that had long been eminent in finance and public service, Mrs. Tuchman could have had an easy, conventional life as the wife of a prominent physician. But as her three daughters grew older, she took up the historian's profession.         She had neither an academic title nor even a graduate degree. ''It's what saved me,'' she later said. ''If I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any writing capacity.'' Her Primary Obstacle         But to be a writer was difficult, she found, simply because she was a woman. ''If a man is a writer,'' she once said, ''everybody tiptoes around past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not professional.' ''         In fact, Mrs. Tuchman had a firm, even contentious, sense of her vocation. In history and biography, she told an audience at the National Portrait Gallery in 1978, ''the writer's object is - or should be - to hold the reader's attention.''         ''I want the reader to turn the page and keep on turning to the end,'' she added. ''This is accomplished only when the narrative moves steadily ahead, not when it comes to a weary standstill, overloaded with every item uncovered in the research.'' An Impression of Authority         In her person as well as in her choice of words, Mrs. Tuchman gave an impression of authority. She had strong features, a high forehead, wise hazel eyes and a somewhat serious manner that gave way, now and then, to a dazzling smile.         Summing up her view of the historical process, she wrote in 1981, in the preface to ''Practicing History,'' a selection of her short writings, that she had arrived at ''a sense of history as accidental and perhaps cyclical, of human conduct as a steady stream running through endless fields of changing circumstances, of good and bad always coexisting and inextricably mixed in periods as in people, of cross-currents and counter-currents usually present to contradict too-easy generalizations.''         Lofty though her views might be, Mrs. Tuchman was down to earth in her research. Before she wrote ''The Guns of August,'' she rented a Renault sedan and toured the appropriate battlefields. When she took notes, it was always on index cards measuring 4 by 6 inches - a convenient size, she said, for storing in shoeboxes and carrying in her purse.         That sort of prosaic concern was far from her exalted birthright. Barbara Wertheim was born on Jan. 30, 1912, in New York, the daughter of Maurice Wertheim, an investment banker, art collector and philanthropist, and Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, a sister of Henry Morgenthau Jr., who was Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Miss Wertheim attended the Walden School before entering Radcliffe College, where she concentrated on history and literature and received her bachelor's degree in 1933. Worked in Japan         Since, as she put it, ''paying jobs did not hang from the trees'' in that Depression year, she took an unpaid position with the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         The following year, she went to Tokyo to help work up an economic handbook of the Pacific area. While there, she wrote for two journals, Far Eastern Survey and Pacific Affairs.         An early contribution was a review of a French historian's book about Japan. Not long after it was printed, she later recalled: ''I was thrilled to receive from the author a letter addressed 'Chere consoeur' (the feminine of confrere, or as we would say, 'colleague'). I felt admitted into an international circle of professionals.''         In 1936, Miss Wertheim went to work for The Nation, which her father had bought to keep it from going bankrupt. Her first job was clipping newspaper articles, but soon she was writing herself, and in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, she went to Valencia and Madrid as The Nation's correspondent. 'Heroes, Hopes, and Illusions'         From Spain she traveled elsewhere in Europe, savoring what she later called ''a somber, exciting, believing, betraying time, with heroes, hopes, and illusions.''         In London, she put together a short book, ''The Lost British Policy,'' about British policy toward Spain and the Western Mediterranean. Her later appraisal of the work, which came out in 1938, was that it was only ''a respectable piece of research,'' and she sometimes omitted it in listing her books.         By 1939, she was back in New York, writing largely on Spain, and the next year she married Dr. Lester Reginald Tuchman, a New York internist.         Mrs. Tuchman was soon showing her strength of will. With Nazi Germany looming, she later wrote, her husband ''not unreasonably felt at that time that the world was too unpromising to bring children into.         ''Sensible for once, I argued that if we waited for the outlook to improve, we might wait forever, and that if we wanted a child at all we should have it now, regardless of Hitler.''         ''The tyranny of men not being quite as total as today's feminists would have us believe,'' she added, writing in 1981, ''our first daughter was born nine months later.'' Separated by Wartime         After Pearl Harbor, Dr. Tuchman went overseas to a United States military hospital, and Mrs. Tuchman got a job in New York with the Office of War Information, preparing material on the Far East for use in broadcasts to Europe.         ''After the war, when my husband came home, we had two more children, and domesticity for a while prevailed,'' she wrote later, ''combined with beginning the work I had always wanted to do, which was writing a book.''         ''When the children were very small,'' she once recalled in an interview, ''I worked in the morning only and then gradually, as they spent full days at school, I could spend full days at work. I could never have done any of this work if I hadn't been able to afford domestic help.''         The fruit of those labors, ''Bible and Sword,'' about relations between Britain and Palestine, came out in 1956. It attracted relatively little notice, though what there was of it was favorable.         Two years later ''The Zimmermann Telegram'' appeared, about a message sent from Berlin to a German diplomat in Mexico in January 1917, raising the possibility of ''an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona,'' and about the message's repercussions after it was intercepted and made public by the British.         Writing in The New York Times, Samuel Flagg Bemis, the Yale diplomatic historian, said the value and importance of the book lay in Mrs. Tuchman's ''brilliant use of well known materials, her sureness of insight and her competent grasp of a complicated chapter of diplomatic history.'' 'The Guns of August'         Attempting something that might have seemed a bit beyond her reach, Mrs. Tuchman took up a far broader and more important topic in her next book, which was ''The Guns of August.'' World War I, as she saw it, was no less than ''the chasm between our world and a world that died forever.''         Though the book was largely about arms and men, it was also about aspirations and ideals. ''Men,'' she concluded, in one widely quoted passage, ''could not sustain a war of such magnitude and pain without hope - the hope that its very enormity would insure that it could never happen again.''         Clifton Fadiman, writing in the Book-of-the-Month-Club News, said: ''Its virtues are almost Thucydidean: intelligence, concision, weight, detachment.''         Writing in The New York Times, Cyril Falls, a British officer turned military historian, said Mrs. Tuchman ''writes so brilliantly and inspiringly.'' The book, he said, was ''lucid, fair, critical and witty.''         But he contended that her performance was uneven, and ''the errors and omissions amount to a formidable total.'' For his part, Bruce Bliven, writing in The New Yorker, complained that ''Mrs. Tuchman leans toward seeing issues as black and white.'' Emphasized Human Qualities         The book's emphasis on the human qualities of the leaders of the time helped make it popular with the public, and it served as the basis for a 1964 documentary film, produced by Nathan Kroll, with the same title.         The quarter-century preceding World War I was the subject of Mrs. Tuchman's next book, ''The Proud Tower,'' which came out in 1966. In a review in The New York Times, Martin Duberman, a Princeton history professor, praised her skill at narrating events, making historical personages come alive, and writing clearly and powerfully about complex matters.         But he said the book did ''not come up to the high level of 'The Guns of August.' '' It was not a portrait of the period, he contended, but merely ''random brush strokes, leaving a canvas unoccupied by any ruling vision.''         When ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45,'' came out, it was hailed as ''brilliant'' in a review in The New Republic by the dean of American China scholars, John K. Fairbank, the director of Harvard University's East Asian Research Center. 'A Distant Mirror'         Another book about Asia, ''Notes From China,'' a slim volume about a six-week trip Mrs. Tuchman had taken, appeared in 1972. But six years went by before the appearance of her next work, ''A Distant Mirror,'' a study of the 14th century, an era that was racked by plague and war.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Eric Cochrane, a professor of history at the University of Chicago, said, ''This book abounds in the same elements that have made her previous books masterpieces of popular scholarship: vivid battle scenes, scenes from daily life, brilliant portraits.'' But he also argued that she was guilty of grave omissions and misinterpretations.         In ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,'' a 1984 book, Mrs. Tuchman scrutinized the Trojans' decision to admit the Greek horse into their city, the refusal of six Renaissance Popes to arrest church corruption in advance of the Protestant Reformation, British misrule under King George III and America's mishandling of the Vietnam conflict.         Mrs. Tuchman had an occasional fondness for twitting figures of authority. She once began a speech to the Army War College by noting that her subject, generalship, had been suggested by the college's commandant.         ''No doubt,'' she observed, ''he could safely assume that the subject in itself would automatically interest this audience in the same way that motherhood would interest an audience of pregnant ladies.''         Mrs. Tuchman is survived by her husband, who is an emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine; a sister, Anne W. Werner of Manhattan; three daughters, Lucy T. Eisenberg of Los Angeles, Jessica Tuchman Mathews of Washington, and Alma Tuchman of Cos Cob and Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is be held at 2 P.M. Sunday in the Celeste Bartos Forum at the main branch of the New York Public Library.

        Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Miss Enters became internationally known during the 1920's for an individual style of dance-mime that Stark Young described as ''free of influences foreign to her nature.'' She specialized in character vignettes, frequently described as wordless monologues, developing nearly 300 separate characters for her touring Theater of Angna Enters from 1928 to 1960.         Her range of subjects was wide, from sharply specific satires on politics and the arts to portraits of ordinary young women. ''To my way of thinking, the greatest quality about Angna Enters is her unfetteredness,'' the dance critic Walter Terry wrote in 1946. In her 1926 ''Moyen Age,'' one of her best-known pieces, Miss Enters seemed to have stepped out of a medieval painting as she enacted a woman's reactions to stories of events in the life of Christ, in a series of fluid poses to music by Frescobaldi. Also an Artist and Sculptor         Miss Enters was also a well-known artist and sculptor who held her first New York exhibition in 1933. She designed and executed all the costumes and props for her performances, and illustrated several of the books she wrote on her life and her work. She also composed scores for some of her pieces.         Miss Enters was born in New York City of an Austrian father and French mother, and spent her childhood in Milwaukee and traveling through Europe. She returned to New York in 1922 to enroll at the Art Students' League, where she studied with John Sloan while doing lettering in an advertising agency during the daytime.         Miss Enters had studied ballet in Milwaukee as she had studied piano, she once said, ''to become 'accomplished.' '' Her adult interest in dance began with a concern for the visual representation of movement. First Dance Work in 1923         She enrolled in dance classes taught by Michio Ito in 1922, and performed as his partner in a series of recitals in 1923. That year she created her first piece, ''Ecclesiastique,'' an evocation of a statue of a Gothic Virgin, which she performed in a Broadway revue organized by Ito. The piece later became ''Moyen Age.'' She presented her first solo program in 1924 at the Greenwich Village Theater with a borrowed $25 as her operating budget.         Her reputation grew rapidly over the next two years, and Miss Enters made her London debut in 1928, performing for the first time in Paris the following year.         Miss Enters wrote three volumes of autobiography - ''First Person Plural,'' ''Silly Girl'' and ''Artist's Life'' - a novel, ''Among the Daughters'' (1956), and a book about her work, ''On Mime,'' published in 1966. Her plays, ''Love Possessed Juana: A Play of the Inquisition in Spain'' and ''The Unknown Lover,'' were presented by the Houston Little Theater in 1946 and 1947. A University Lecturer         A noted master teacher, Miss Enters lectured at universities throughout the country. In the early 1960's, she was an artist in residence at the Dallas Theater Center and Baylor University and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.         Miss Enters retired from performing in 1960, and had been in nursing homes since 1976. There are no survivors.       
        Beatrice Swancutt Wright Fuerst, former assistant director of women's activities for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, died of natural causes Wednesday at Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 83 years old and lived in Rhinebeck.         Beatrice Swancutt Wright Fuerst, former assistant director of women's activities for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, died of natural causes Wednesday at Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 83 years old and lived in Rhinebeck.         Mrs. Fuerst joined the foundation in 1946. In 1949 she contracted polio, from which she later recovered. R. K. Merton's 1968 book, ''On the Shoulders of Giants: the Bea Wright Story,'' published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, was based on her case. She retired in 1971.         She is survived by her husband, Myron M. Fuerst; three sons from an earlier marriage, Harris Haertel of Seattle, Richard Haertel of Plymouth, Mich., and Thomas Haertel of Kamloops, Canada; two brothers, Woodrow Swancutt of San Antonio, Tex., and Vernon Swancutt of La Crosse, Wis., eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.         Correction:  March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Late City Final Edition         An obituary on Saturday about Beatrice S. W. Fuerst misidentified a book about her battle against polio.         Published in 1960 by the Chilton Company, it was titled ''On the Shoulders of Giants: the Bea Wright Story'' and was written by Eleanor Chappell. A 1965 book entitled ''On the Shoulders of Giants: A Shandean Postscript,'' written by Robert K. Merton and published by Harcourt Brace, is an unrelated scholarly work.

Viola Ilma, a writer, died Tuesday at the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., after a stroke. She was 78 years old and lived in Saratoga Springs.         She wrote ''And Now, Youth!'', a book published in 1934 about American young people, and a memoir, ''A Political Virgin,'' published in 1938.         In 1936, she organized the first American Youth Congress, a meeting in New York City of youth groups from across the nation.

Esther Morgenstern Gilman, a painter, illustrator and set designer, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         Mrs. Gilman's exhibitions here and abroad included a recent retrospective in her native Cleveland. Her prizes include the Robert Boardman award of the Painters and Sculptors Society of New Jersey, the American Institute of Graphic Arts Exhibition award and the Outstanding Children's Book Illustration award for ''Little Girl and Her Mother'' by Beatrice Schenk de Regnier.         Mrs. Gilman was an editorial board member of the Femninist Press and a consultant for the Open Theater. She created sets for productions at Cafe Cino, Writer's Stage, Van Dam Playhouse, Judson Memorial Church, Theater Genesis and La Mama.         Mrs. Gilman's marriage to Richard Gilman, a drama critic, ended in divorce. She is survived by her son, Nicholas Alexander Gilman.         A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. today at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.       
        Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920 and, over the years, turned it into an international literary haven. It is still thriving at 41 West 47th Street in Manhattan, an anachronism in a time of failing independent bookstores.         Soon after the store opened, it attracted authors, dramatists, poets and artists. Among those who came to chat, to browse and to see if their books and plays were on the shelves were Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, H. L. Mencken and Eugene O'Neill. Her customers included George and Ira Gershwin, Ina Claire and Charlie Chaplin, and, more recently, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, John Guare and Garson Kanin.         She championed the experimental and challenged the censors. Her courage in purchasing shipments of the banned ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' directly from D. H. Lawrence in Italy in the late 1920's and in ordering smuggled copies of ''Tropic of Cancer'' from Henry Miller in Paris during the 1930's led to lawsuits and landmark decisions on censorship.         Although Miss Steloff sold the Gotham in 1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, she continued to live in an apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working consultant. She ignored her age and her semiretirement, descending every afternoon to sit at a desk in her own corner, occasionally jumping up to press books on browsers, and then to direct them to the cash register. Browsers Welcome         Essentially a person of no literary pretensions, Miss Steloff made her bookstore a place cherished as the habitat for the new and the avant-garde in literature, where small magazines and forgotten books of poetry, out-of-print books on belles-lettres and works on film and the theater could be found in an atmosphere congenial to browsers.         Under her guidance the Gotham became a meeting place for the literati and a bibliophile's paradise. The number of well-known writers, dancers, artists and theater people who were her customers, clients and friends made up an encyclopedia of 20th-century culture. At her 100th birthday celebration, on Dec. 31, 1987, greetings arrived from all over the world.         Miss Steloff was one of the founders of the James Joyce Society, which still meets at the Gotham, although she never met the author. ''Sylvia Beach took care of his book wants at Shakespeare & Company in Paris,'' she said. ''But sometimes Joyce ordered books from the Gotham directly by mail - including during the last year of his life.''         After working in several bookstores, she opened her own on West 45th Street in 1920. The store moved twice to larger quarters. ''It was a struggle at the beginning,'' she recalled. ''There were some days during the Depression when we didn't sell a single book.'' An Interest in the Mystical         ''I am not the great brilliant person to decide about how good a book is,'' she said once. ''I judge books by my customers who buy them and spark others to read them.'' She was greatly interested in Oriental teachings, mystical experiences and philosophers not connected with established Western churches. Books in these fields were represented in her corner of the store.         Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully operated book business. As the owner and the person who paid the salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much concentration into the store as she did.         Miss Steloff recalled some of the clerks who had worked for the Gotham over the years. ''There was Allen Ginsberg and LeRoi Jones and many poets in their youth,'' she said. ''Tennessee Williams lasted less than a day - he couldn't get here on time in the morning and, also, he wasn't very good at wrapping packages.'' Sold Flowers in Hotels         Ida Frances Steloff was born Dec. 31, 1887, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a town full of gaiety in the summer and a bleak, wintry place for the rest of the year, especially for the poor. The Steloffs, who lived year round in Saratoga Springs, were among the very poor. When Miss Stefloff was little, she sold flowers on the verandas of the big hotels. The early death of her mother increased her misery, especially when her stepmother expressed her frustrations with poverty in the harshness she showed the children.         At 12, Miss Steloff was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. But she soon found herself a menial in the household and was forced to drop out of the seventh grade - her last formal schooling. Once in desperation she ran away to New York City. It was not until she was 19 that she made a final move to New York. She landed a job at Loeser's, a Brooklyn department store, working in ''corsets.'' But during the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the books department.         It was like giving a copy of Euclid to Isaac Newton: She had found herself and a way of life.         For the next 12 years she worked in various bookstores: Schulte, Brentano and McDevitt-Wilson, where she developed what one friend called ''an instinctive taste for the best in modern literature,'' a taste that she was willing to gamble on when she had her own shop. She never referred to Gotham as a store; it was always a ''shop.''         Her stature concealed her stamina. She ran the place, but she also opened the correspondence, wrapped and mailed packages, climbed up and down ladders and argued with publishers. Bookstore people were continually helping her down from ladders in her 80's. ''She feels,'' Mr. Brown said, ''as if she still has to stock the store.'' A Doctorate From Skidmore         Miss Steloff was awarded a prize by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for distinguished service to the arts, was listed in Who's Who in the Theater and received an honorary doctorate from Skidmore College - an award that stood in sharp contrast to one of her remarks:         ''I used to feel bitter and cheated about not having a formal education. But why should I? How could I, no matter what my education, ever have had the wonderful chance to have Thornton Wilder and other people talk to me personally, and right here in my shop! As if they were in their classrooms! I couldn't ask for anything more.''         A battle to save the bookstore ended last February, when Mr. Brown bought the building that houses the store from the American Friends of the Hebrew University Foundation. With the $1 million proceeds, the foundation has established a scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the name of Miss Steloff's parents.         It was quiet yesterday at the cozy bookstore, with a sprinkling of students and literary buffs brousing through the volumes. In the hall on the second floor hung oversized photographs of Miss Steloff - with Dylan Thomas in 1952, Anais Nin in 1966, Jean Cocteau in 1948, Salvador Dali in 1963, Marianne Moore in 1967. Memorial Service Is Planned         Although funeral arrangements were not yet complete, Mr. Brown said yesterday that Miss Steloff would be buried Monday in the family plot in the Jewish Cemetery at Saratoga Springs.         The Gotham will be closed on that day in her memory. Mr. Brown said he would post a sign and pictures of Miss Steloff in the bookstore window. A memorial service is to be held in three or four weeks, he said.         On May 11, Miss Steloff was to have been presented Brandeis University's Notable Achievement Award.         Miss Steloff was married to David Moss in 1923. They were divorced in 1930 and had no children.         Surviving are a half sister, Belle Sidoroff, of Wilmington, Del., and a half brother, Al Steloff, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.       
        Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, the retired head librarian of the New York Botanical Garden, died of heart failure Wednesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 91 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, the retired head librarian of the New York Botanical Garden, died of heart failure Wednesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 91 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Hall used to say that she was just no good at retiring. She tried it once, at 70. But she promptly went to work for the Horticultural Society of New York as its librarian emeritus. She returned to the New York Botanical Garden in 1982, in its plant-information service, dispensing advice on dubious mushrooms and sympathy to people with terminal plants.         Once, when a caller asked how she might kill a tree without her husband's knowledge, Miss Hall replied, ''Well, you could kill your husband first.''         She worked at the plant-information service five days a week until January.         Officially, Miss Hall was the Botanical Garden's head librarian for 23 years, from 1937 to 1960. She worked as a research librarian for an additional three years, then became curator of education before attempting retirement in 1967. 'The Gentle Side'         Vigorous and energetic, Miss Hall made three trips to China while in her 80's and continued reading at least one book a week. ''I go to bed around midnight and get up at 7 A.M.,'' she explained, ''and I don't use up energy with makeup, hairdos or manicures.''         She inspired and nurtured America's leading garden writers and horticulturists. ''Helping people to learn about, care for and enjoy plants has given me a joyous life,'' she said on her 90th birthday. ''Plants bring out the gentle side of people.''         For her 90th birthday, the New York Botanical Garden, plus the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Horticultural Society of New York, the New York branch of the Herb Society of America and Wave Hill, paid tribute to her at a birthday party, attesting to the fact that Miss Hall had become an indispensible reference work herself.         Born in Meriden, Conn., she graduated from Radcliffe College and earned a certificate from the Ambler School of Horticulture, now part of Temple University, and a master's degree from Columbia University.         Before joining the Botanical Garden, Miss Hall had been the librarian at the Horticultural Society of New York. She had previously worked as a children's librarian for the New York Public Library.         She aided generations of horticulturists, who admired her wisdom and were amused by her quirks. ''Hers has been an enthusiastic force amongst her worldwide colleagues,'' wrote Charles D. Webster, former president of the Horticultural Society.         Miss Hall loved horse racing. She kept a well-organized card catalogue of promising 2-year-olds, which she called ''my sleepers,'' and she went to the track with relish. ''Here I was, supposed to be a perfectly old-maid, New England librarian,'' said Miss Hall, in no danger of becoming a stereotype. She delighted in telling of once having won the daily double.         She left no survivors.       
        Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Kornfeld was the author of ''Profile of America,'' published in 1954 by Thomas Y. Crowell Company. The book, an illustrated history of the United States, was a compilation of writing by Americans like Thoreau and Jefferson. It was critically acclaimed and a best seller.         But Congress refused to appropriate money for the United States Information Agency to purchase the book for its libraries abroad after a House appropriations subcommittee objected to the work on the basis of pictures that showed a rural schoolhouse and a plain-looking schoolteacher.         The action created a furor in newspapers and magazines. ''What kind of puerility is this?'' asked an editorial in The New York Times. ''Is Congress to pass on every book, to censor every publication?''         The foreword to the book was written by Charles A. Lindbergh, and the introduction was by Louis Bromfield. Mrs. Kornfeld, who wrote the book before she was married, waived her royalties.         Mrs. Kornfeld was a granddaughter of a founder of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. She was born in Tuxedo Park, graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared on the stage on Broadway and at the Old Vic in London.         She was predeceased by her husband, Joseph S. Kornfeld. In 1978, she established a foundation in the name of her husband and herself, which awards grants in medical research and related fields. Mrs. Kornfeld was the founder of the Tuxedo Historical Society.         She had no survivors.       
        Margery A. Ryerson, a painter and lithographer, died March 30 at the King Street Nursing Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 102 years old.         Margery A. Ryerson, a painter and lithographer, died March 30 at the King Street Nursing Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 102 years old.         Miss Ryerson was known for her portraits of children, and many of her prints are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Brooklyn Museum and other American museums. For many years she exhibited her works with Grand Central Art Galleries, and she received awards from the Hudson Valley Art Association and the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park in New York, where she lived for more than 30 years.         Miss Ryerson studied art with Robert Henri and Charles Hawthorne, and edited Mr. Henri's ''Art Spirit,'' a book on the philosophy of art. She was also a co-editor of ''Hawthorne on Painting'' and frequently wrote about art for magazines, newspapers and art journals.         Miss Ryerson was a descendant of one of the first Dutch families to settle in the United States and her ancestral home in New Jersey, Ringwood Manor, is now a state park.         There are no survivors.       
        Alice-Leone Moats, a journalist who was the author of nine books, died Sunday at Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia, after a long illness. She was 81 years old and lived in Philadelphia.         Alice-Leone Moats, a journalist who was the author of nine books, died Sunday at Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia, after a long illness. She was 81 years old and lived in Philadelphia.         Miss Moats was a foreign correspondent for Collier's magazine in Japan, China and the Soviet Union, among other countries, before becoming a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer.         Born in Mexico of wealthy and socially prominent American parents, she was educated at convent schools in Mexico City, Rome and Paris, at the Brearley School in Manhattan and the Fermata School for Girls in Aiken, N.C.         In 1933 she wrote ''No Nice Girl Swears'' (St. Martin's Press), a sassy book of etiquette that immediately became a best seller. It took years of foreign correspondence and the publishing in 1943 of her favorite book, ''Blind Date with Mars,'' (Doubleday Doran) about a journey through the Far East, before the furor cooled off.         In a 1984 interview, Miss Moats, who never married although she said she had been engaged eight times, noted that society had changed. Instead of pretty debutantes, she said, society had become what she called ''the Face Lift Brigade.''         ''I'm glad I had money when I was young and pretty,'' she said.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Dorothy Ruth Pirone, whose father was Babe Ruth but who did not learn the identity of her natural mother until she was 59 years old, died yesterday at her home in Durham, Conn. She was 68 years old.         Dorothy Ruth Pirone, whose father was Babe Ruth but who did not learn the identity of her natural mother until she was 59 years old, died yesterday at her home in Durham, Conn. She was 68 years old.         For most of her life, Mrs. Pirone was led to believe that her mother was the baseball star's first wife, Helen. Over the years, Mr. Ruth and his first wife gave conflicting birth dates and details. It was not until 1980 that Mrs. Pirone learned her real mother was Juanita Jennings, a woman she had grown up knowing and loving as a close family friend.         Last year, Mrs. Pirone wrote a book about her father, ''My Dad, the Babe,'' which was co-authored by Chris Martens and published on the 40th anniversary of her father's death, Aug. 16, 1988.         Mrs. Pirone, who raised Arabian horses in Durham for more than a dozen years, is survived by four daughters, a son and 12 grandchildren.       
        Gilda Radner, the Emmy Award-winning comedian who created the nasal-voiced broadcaster Roseanne Roseannadanna, the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Loopner and the bumbling complainer Emily Litella for the television show ''Saturday Night Live,'' died of cancer early yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 42 years old.         Gilda Radner, the Emmy Award-winning comedian who created the nasal-voiced broadcaster Roseanne Roseannadanna, the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Loopner and the bumbling complainer Emily Litella for the television show ''Saturday Night Live,'' died of cancer early yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 42 years old.         ''There's a preciseness to her parody,'' the critic Molly Haskell once said of Miss Radner. ''Like Dickens, she's added people to the world who bear her stamp. And even when she's tasteless you don't wince. There's something very gentle and sweet in Gilda that comes through.''         As a guest editorialist on ''Saturday Night Live's'' parody of the weekend news, Miss Radner, in the character of Miss Litella, would rail against broadcasters for paying too much attention to ''endangered feces.'' And only when it was made clear to her that the subject was ''endangered species'' would she back off, mewling, ''Never mind.'' Other topics that enraged her included conservation of national race horses, preoccupation with violins on television and concern for Soviet jewelry.         Besides her standard ''Never mind,'' Miss Radner coined the catch phrase for the scatterbrained Roseanne Roseannadanna, ''It's always something,'' which became the title of a book she wrote detailing her fight with ovarian cancer. By Her Side         Miss Radner, whose illness was diagnosed two and a half years ago, died in her sleep about 6:20 A.M. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said. Her husband of five years, the actor and filmmaker Gene Wilder, was at her side.         ''I loved her like a sister; my thoughts are with Gene and her family,'' said Dan Aykroyd, a fellow ''Saturday Night'' star. Mr. Aykroyd's comments were relayed by a spokeswoman, Susan Patricola.         Miss Radner, who won the Emmy as the outstanding actress in a variety series, was reared in a quasi-theatrical family in Detroit. ''My father had a hotel,'' she once told an interviewer, ''and people in show business used to stay there. He loved peformers and entertainment, and I grew up knowing that. Some of his spunk must have come out in me, because he used to love to perform, too. He was funny, he could tell a good story, he could do magic tricks.''         When Gilda was 12, her father became terminally ill. Two years later, he died and left her a large estate. Majored in Drama         She majored in drama at the University of Michigan, dropped out and followed a boyfriend to Canada, where she landed a role in the Toronto production of ''Godspell'' and later with the comedy revue ''Second City.'' In 1974 she came to New York to do ''The National Lampoon Radio Hour'' and ''The National Lampoon Show.''         Soon after, Lorne Michaels, the creator of ''Saturday Night Live,'' began putting together the show. He had seen some of Miss Radner's work. ''I felt there was a remarkable quality to her, a goodness which came through whatever she was doing,'' he said. When, in 1975, he was ready to sign on cast members, he chose Miss Radner first.         In 1979, Miss Radner took her television characters - including Baba Wawa, a spoof of Barbara Walters - to Broadway, where she appeared at the Winter Garden in a revue ''Gilda Live.'' The production was then filmed and released as a movie. In Several Films         After ''Saturday Night Live'' she appeared in several films, including ''First Family'' and ''The Woman in Red,'' a 1984 hit written and directed by her co-star and future husband, Mr. Wilder. She also appeared in ''Haunted Honeymoon,'' ''Hanky Panky'' and ''It Came From Hollywood.''         Miss Radner also starred in a dramatic role on Broadway in the play ''Lunch Hour'' with Sam Waterston, in 1980. ''Wanna know my biggest fear?'' she asked just before a performance of the Jean Kerr play. ''It's that I'll come out and someone in the audience will yell, 'Hey, Gilda! Do Roseanne Roseannadanna!' ''         Funeral services will be private.       
        Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Ms. Zemach was the illustrator or author of more than 40 children's books, including ''Duffy and the Devil,'' ''The Judge,'' ''A Penny a Look,'' ''Salt'' ''Mommy, Buy Me a China Doll,'' ''It Could Always Be Worse'' and ''To Hilda for Helping.''         ''Margot not only revivified the American picture book, but was one of the very few who helped elevate it to an art form,'' said Maurice Sendak, the children's book author and illustrator. ''She was one of the most accomplished picture-book artists on the international scene - a superlative draftsman, a shrewd psychologist and most important, a passionate, tragicomic original.'' Won the Caldecott Medal         ''I consider her the consummate illustrator for children's literature,'' said William Steig, the childrens' book author and illustrator, and a magazine artist for The New Yorker. ''There's no doubt her work will endure.''         In 1974, for ''Duffy and the Devil,'' Ms. Zemach won the Caldecott Medal, the most prestigious American award for children's book illustration, sponsored by the American Library Association. She was twice selected as the American nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, the most prestigious international children's book award.         Ms. Zemach was born Nov. 30, 1931 in Los Angeles, and studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute. She won a Fulbright Scholarship to study drawing in Vienna in 1955. Collaborated With Her Husband         In 1957, she and another Fulbright student, Harvey Fischtrom, were married and began a children's-book collaboration that was to last until her husband's death in 1974.         Their first book, ''Small Boy Is Listening,'' published under the double byline of Margot and Harve Zemach appeared in 1959. She did the drawings and he wrote the text.         At the time of her death Ms. Zemach was working on a picture book of ''Mother Goose'' nursery rhymes. Her principal publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, plans to issue it in 1990.         She is survived by her stepfather, Benjamin; a sister, Amielle; four daughters, Heidi, Rachel, Rebecca and Kaethe Zemach-Bersin, and two granddaughters.       
        Sally Kirkland, a chronicler of fashion for more than 30 years, died of emphysema Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Sally Kirkland, a chronicler of fashion for more than 30 years, died of emphysema Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         From 1947 to 1969 she was the fashion editor of Life magazine, making that general-interest weekly influential in international fashion. She stopped traffic in the Place de la Concorde in Paris to get a fashion picture. A cover photograph of Sybil Connally, the Irish designer, put Ireland on the fashion map.         She received the Order of the Star of Solidarity in 1954 from the Italian Government for her reports on Italian clothes. ''I was secretly pleased,'' she told a friend, ''because the medal was green and gold and looked well on an orange evening dress I had to whip up for the affair.''         Along with Grace Kelly and Vera Maxwell, the designer, she received a Neiman-Marcus award in 1955 for contributions to fashion.         After graduating from Vassar College in 1934, she worked in the college shop at Lord & Taylor, then the headquarters for the best casual American clothes. In 1939 she became an assistant editor of Vogue magazine, leaving nine years later to become the fashion editor of Life.         She was the first fashion editor to do multiple-model sittings, recalled Nancy White, the former fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar. A dozen or more models would stretch across one or two pages for a dazzling presentation that was widely copied.         After she left Life magazine, Mrs. Kirkland wrote a book about Claire McCardell, her favorite designer, and contributed articles to the RAM Report, a monthly trade journal.         She is survived by a daughter, Sally Kirkland, the actress, of Los Angeles, and a brother, Robert T. Phinney of Santa Fe, N.M. The funeral will be private.       
        Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         The San Clemente General Hospital issued a statement saying Miss Jorgensen's death followed a long bout with bladder and lung cancer.         Miss Jorgensen was born in the Westchester section of the Bronx on May 20, 1926, and was named George Jorgensen Jr. In her book, ''Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Biography,'' published in 1967, Miss Jorgensen said she had a normal, happy childhood but on growing up became frustrated by feelings that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. A Sensation in Tabloids         As George Jorgensen, she served as a clerk in the Army. After being honorably discharged, she decided to seek a sex change operation.         Her sexual conversion began with hormone injections in 1950, when she was 24 years old. It was completed in 1952 with surgery at the Danish State Hospital in Copenhagen under the care of Dr. Christian Hamburger, a Danish hormone expert whose first name she took to form her own.         On her return to the United States in 1955, her transsexualism was sensationalized in the daily tabloids, some of which she gave exclusive interviews.         One tabloid headline read, ''Bronx GI Becomes a Woman!'' and went on, ''Dear Mum and Dad, Son Wrote, I Have Now Become Your Daughter.''         The New York Times carried a five-paragraph Associated Press story headlined, ''Bronx 'Boy' Is Now A Girl.''         ''At first I was very self-conscious and very awkward,'' Miss Jorgensen said in an interview in 1970. ''But once the notoriety hit, it did not take me long to adjust.''         Miss Jorgensen was the first transsexual in the United States to publicly announce her change of sexual identity. Rather than withdraw from public attention, she turned the notoriety to her advantage with a series of lucrative tours on the lecture and nightclub circuit. Her nightclub act featured the theme song, ''I Enjoy Being a Girl.''         ''I decided if they wanted to see me, they would have to pay for it,'' she said. Chose Not to Marry         She made headlines again in 1959 when she sought, but was denied, a license to marry because her birth certificate said she was a male. She later chose not to marry. She could not have had children.         In an interview last year, she said she never regretted her decision to change sexes. She linked the public reaction to her decision, in part, to the awakening that led to the sexual revolution of the 1950's and 1960's.         But as a person who had experienced both sides of the issue, she said in an interview in 1972 that she did not understand the women's liberation movement.         Discussing the subject with a group of students at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, Miss Jorgensen said: ''I don't know very many women who arent't liberated. Men need liberation too.''         For the last 20 years, she lived in California, the last two in San Clemente.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy, and two nieces.       
        Christine Weston, a novelist and short-story writer whose work was set largely in India, died Wednesday in her apartment in Bangor, Me., her family reported. She was 85 years old.         Christine Weston, a novelist and short-story writer whose work was set largely in India, died Wednesday in her apartment in Bangor, Me., her family reported. She was 85 years old.         Praising her work, E. M. Forster wrote in 1950: ''Mrs. Weston writes seriously, carefully compassionately; she is not interested in the glamorous East or in the boosting of this or that political creed; she writes for those who are emotionally involved in the country and who love it.''         Reviewing her novel ''Indigo'' in The New York Times in 1943, Willard Thorp cited ''the richness of the setting - the fragrance and the filth of the river and its plains, the languorous days and liq=uid nights, the rank jungle growth, the tug of racial conflict.''         For her part, Mrs. Weston once wrote: ''The country of one's childhood is always predominant in one's memory: India is a beautiful, kindly land, and notwithstanding all the perils of life in the tropics, it is a fine country for any child to grow up in.''         Mrs. Weston wrote 10 novels; more than 30 short stories, most of which appeared in The New Yorker magazine; two nonfiction books - on Ceylon and Afghanistan, respectively - and a children's book.         She was born Christine Goutiere in Unao in what is now Uttar Pradesh in northern India. She was the daughter of Georges Goutiere and the former Alicia Wintle. Her father was a British barrister who was descended from French indigo planters in India. She grew up in India, assisted her father, married an American businessman, Robert Weston in 1923, and moved with him to Maine, where she resided thereafter. Some of her fiction is set in New England.         Her other books include the novels ''Be Thou the Bride'' (1940), ''The Devil's Foot'' (1942), ''The Dark Wood'' (1946), ''The World Is a Bridge'' (1950), ''The Hoopoe'' (1970) and a volume of short stories, ''There and Then'' (1947).         She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940.         After her first husband's death in the early 1950's, she married Roger Griswold in 1960. He died in 1973.         Mrs. Weston is survived by a sister, Geraldine Goutiere Acomb, of Avon, Conn., and two brothers, Vernon, of Patterson, Calif., and Peter, of Coral Springs, Fla.       
        Honor Tracy, a travel writer, columnist and novelist who satirized Irish and English society, died Tuesday in a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 75 years old.         Honor Tracy, a travel writer, columnist and novelist who satirized Irish and English society, died Tuesday in a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 75 years old.         The best novels by Miss Tracy, who was born and educated in England and lived much of her life in rural Ireland, were hailed by reviewers for wittily dissecting the nonsense in which people allow themselves to be immersed. With astringent mockery, she reveled in lampooning false pretensions, snobbery and intellectual muddles.         Reviewers and readers repeatedly praised Miss Tracy's incisive travel accounts, particularly those from Japan, Spain and the West Indies, and her newspaper columns in The Sunday Times of London, The Daily Telegraph and other papers.         Her specialty in more than a dozen novels was mocking English-Irish antagonisms. Her third novel, ''The Prospects Are Pleasing'' (1958), included this exchange between Tommy, an Irishman, and Felix, an Englishman:         ''No wonder your empire is crumbling,'' Tommy said. ''Empires do,'' replied Felix cheerfully. ''It's a little way of theirs. Be glad you never got one.'' ''Who says we didn't?'' said Tommy angrily. ''Our empire is spiritual and intellectual and extends all over the world. It existed already when you fellows were running about painted blue. Yours was a little tinpot affair of guns and Bibles and trade.'' Handing On the Best         In an interview, Miss Tracy remarked, ''If something interests, pleases or amuses me, I imagine it may do the same for other people and I try to pass it on. Also, I have an orderly mind, and writing is a sort of tidying up and clarifying of life.''         Harold H. Watts, quoted in the 1972 book ''Contemporary Novelists,'' concluded that ''her novels are designed to be read with a glass of sherry in the hand, preferably in the company of persons as basically sensible as the ideal reader of Miss Tracy's work.''         Honor Lilbush Wingfield Tracy was born on Oct. 19, 1913, in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk County, England, the daughter of a surgeon. She was educated privately and at the Grove School in London and lived in County Mayo, Ireland, in later years.         She started her career as an assistant in a London publishing house, did intelligence work in the British Women's Auxiliary Air Force from 1939 to 1941, rising to sergeant, and was a specialist on Japan in London's Ministry of Information from 1941 to 1945. She was a correspondent for The Observer, then The Sunday Times and was a longtime contributor of talks and features for the British Broadcasting Corporation.         Miss Tracy's travel works included ''Kakemono: A Sketchbook of Postwar Japan'' (1950), ''Spanish Leaves'' (1964), ''Winter in Castile'' (1973) and ''The Heart of England'' (1983). Her novels included ''The Deserters'' (1954), ''The Straight and Narrow Path'' (1956), ''A Number of Things'' (1959), ''A Season of Mists'' (1961), ''The Quiet End of Evening'' (1972) and ''The Ballad of Castle Reef'' (1979).         She was married briefly and divorced and had no children.       
        Lisa Sergio, a pioneer radio news broadcaster in Mussolini's Italy who became a dedicated anti-Fascist and a news commentator for WQXR and other American radio stations, died of a heart attack Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 84 years old.         Lisa Sergio, a pioneer radio news broadcaster in Mussolini's Italy who became a dedicated anti-Fascist and a news commentator for WQXR and other American radio stations, died of a heart attack Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 84 years old.         Miss Sergio, a slender, fiery contralto once known as ''the Golden Voice of Rome,'' also translated the dictator's blustering speeches into English and French almost simultaneously on the air until her modifications of propaganda commentaries prompted her dismissal from Rome radio.         Faced with arrest and internment in 1937, she was smuggled aboard a trans-Atlantic liner by a family friend, Guglielmo Marconi, the radio developer. She settled in New York City, where she soon became a guest observer for NBC radio and the host for broadcasts including Metropolitan Opera performances and Berkshire music festivals.         She then became one of the few female news commentators with her own program, broadcasting seven times a week on WQXR from 1939 to 1946, when the station dropped single news commentaries in favor of forum talks. 'Mental Honesty'         ''Lisa Sergio was a most attractive personality both on and off the air,'' said Elliott M. Sanger, a founder and longtime executive of the station. In his 1973 book about WQXR, ''Rebel in Radio,'' he hailed her comments on foreign news and cultural events.         Miss Sergio was a fervent advocate of democracy, free speech and feminism. Analyzing her broadcasts, she said, ''Mental honesty is essential because the microphone has a strange and impolite way of sending over the airwaves not only what the commentators say, but also what they think.''         The commentator was born Elisa Sergio in Florence to Baron Agostino Sergio, a landowner, and the former Margaret FitzGerald of Baltimore.         With no professional background, she soon became the editor of Italian Mail, an English literary weekly in Florence, worked as a freelance writer and researched and wrote on archeology. After her broadcasting career in Rome and New York, she taught propaganda analysis at Columbia University, lectured widely at American colleges and wrote several books, including ''I Am My Beloved: the Life of Anita Garibaldi'' (1965). She was also a board member or trustee of many philanthropic and cultural groups.         There are no immediate survivors.

She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She was born in Manchester, Conn., and attended Bryn Mawr College.         She married Dr. Spock in 1927 and assisted him in the research and writing of ''Dr. Spock's Baby & Child Care'' (E. P. Dutton), which was published in 1946 by Duell, Sloan & Pearce as ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care.'' The book has sold more than 34 million copies in 31 languages.         Mrs. Spock was active in Americans for Democratic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. After her divorce in 1976, she organized and ran support groups for older divorced women.         Surviving are two sons, Michael, of Chicago, and John, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.

        Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, a French Resistance hero who was once smuggled out of the country in a mailbag to escape the Nazis, died today in a Paris military hospital, friends reported. She was 79 years old.         Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, a French Resistance hero who was once smuggled out of the country in a mailbag to escape the Nazis, died today in a Paris military hospital, friends reported. She was 79 years old.         When France fell to the Germans in 1940, Mrs. Fourcade and a few friends organized a Resistance group called Alliance, which eventually numbered about 3,000. Of that number, one-third were jailed or killed by the Germans.         The Germans caught Mrs. Fourcade four times, but she was released or escaped each time.         Each of the group's agents took the name of an animal, and she was known as Hedgehog. In 1968, she published a book about her experiences entitled ''Noah's Ark.''         After the war, she helped found the party led by Charles de Gaulle.

She was 84 years old and lived at the Osborn Retirement Community in Rye, N.Y.         Ruth West, a New York writer and former advertising executive, died as the result of a stroke Thursday at United Hospital in Portchester, N.Y. She was 84 years old and lived at the Osborn Retirement Community in Rye, N.Y.         Ms. West came to Manhattan in 1929 from Michigan, where she had attended the University of Michigan and Antioch College. She worked for a number of advertising agencies, including J. Walter Thompson, and department stores, including Bamberger's in Newark. She was the advertising manager of Saks Fifth Avenue in the early 1940's and a vice president for the C. J. LaRoche agency in the 1950's. She retired in 1965 to devote herself to writing.         She published her first book ''Stop Dieting! Start Losing!'' (E. P. Dutton), a collection of ''decalorized recipes,'' in 1956. Her other books include ''The Teen-Age Diet Book'' (Julian Messner, 1957). In 1972, she assisted Dr. Robert C. Atkins in writing ''Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution'' (McKay), one of the all-time mass-market best sellers, according to Publisher's Weekly.         Ms. West is survived by a daughter, Piri Halasz of Manhattan; three stepsons, and a stepdaughter.       
        Nancy Makepeace Tanner, an anthropologist and author of ''On Becoming Human,'' which deals with food-gatherers in early human evolution, died of a heart attack June 20 at the home of her brother-in-law in Tucson, Ariz. She was 56 years old.         Nancy Makepeace Tanner, an anthropologist and author of ''On Becoming Human,'' which deals with food-gatherers in early human evolution, died of a heart attack June 20 at the home of her brother-in-law in Tucson, Ariz. She was 56 years old.         Mrs. Tanner was an associate professor of anthropology at the University of California at Santa Cruz and a fellow of the university's Merrill College. She joined the faculty in 1969 from the University of Chicago, where she had earned her bachelor's and master's degrees.         Her doctoral dissertation at the University of California at Berkeley laid the groundwork for her fieldwork and studies with matrilineal Moslems in West Sumatra, Indonesia.         Mrs. Tanner's book, ''On Becoming Human,'' published by Cambridge Press in 1981, reconstructed early social behavior from field studies of primates and of human food-gathering societies, as well as from fossil and archeological data. In the book Mrs. Tanner developed , a theory of human origins that focused on the role of female food-gatherers in evolution.         Mrs. Tanner, who lived in Santa Cruz, is survived by her husband, Jim Moore; two daughters, Elna Brunckhorst of Berkeley and Elizabeth Brunckhorst of Felton, Calif.; a stepmother, Edith Tanner of Green Bay, Wis.; a brother, Tom Tanner of Yorkville, Ill., and a grandson.

Lavinia Williams, a dancer and teacher, died of a heart attack on July 19 at the Canape Vert Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. She was 73 years old.         Miss Williams danced leading roles with the Katherine Dunham Dance Company from 1940 to 1945. She appeared with the company in the Broadway musical ''Cabin in the Sky'' and in the films ''Stormy Weather'' and ''Carnival of Rhythm.''         After leaving the Dunham company, Miss Williams toured Europe with the Noble Sissle revival of ''Shuffle Along,'' dancing the role originated by Josephine Baker. Miss Williams also appeared on Broadway in a 1946 revival of ''Showboat'' and in ''Finian's Rainbow'' and ''My Darlin' Aida.''         She was considered a leader in teaching Haitian dance. Miss Williams arrived in Haiti in 1953 to work with members of the National Folkloric Troupe. She founded the Haitian Institute of Folklore and Classic Dance in 1954, and taught in Antigua, the Bahamas, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad.         She also taught at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center School in Manhattan.         Miss Williams wrote many essays and articles on Haitian dance and also a book, ''Haiti Dance.'' Joining Von Grona Troupe         Miss Williams was born in Philadelphia, and began studying dance at the age of 3. As a scholarship student at the Art Students League in Manhattan, she was invited to sketch dancers during a rehearsal of the Eugene Von Grona American Negro Ballet, and she was invited to join the company. She remained with the company for three years, appearing with the Von Grona Swing Ballet in Lew Leslie's ''Blackbirds of 1939.''         She danced in Agnes de Mille's ''Black Ritual,'' presented by Ballet Theater in its first season, in 1940. Miss Williams's teachers included Anna Sokolow, Martha Graham, Lisan Kay and Kyra Nijinsky.         Miss Williams's marriage to Shannon Yarborough ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Sara Yarborough Smith and Sharron.

        Oriana Atkinson, a writer and the widow of Brooks Atkinson, a former drama critic of The New York Times, died of pneumonia on Monday at the Huntsville (Ala.) Hospital. She was 94 years old and had lived in Huntsville for 10 years.         Oriana Atkinson, a writer and the widow of Brooks Atkinson, a former drama critic of The New York Times, died of pneumonia on Monday at the Huntsville (Ala.) Hospital. She was 94 years old and had lived in Huntsville for 10 years.         Mrs. Atkinson was the author of eight books of fact and fiction, two of which were best sellers. ''Over at Uncle Joe's,'' published in 1947, was a personal account of her life among the Russians in wartime and postwar Moscow in the 10 months she spent there with her husband.         Her 1954 best seller, ''Manhattan and Me,'' lightly described the changes that had occurred in her native New York since the time she had grown up in Greenwich Village. In the book, she wrote that although New York was the least beloved of cities, it was the most desired. She also wrote poetry and articles for The New York Times and other publications.         The Atkinsons maintained a farm in Durham, N.Y., in the Catskills, where they lived after Mr. Atkinson's retirement. Later, for health and family reasons, they moved to Huntsville, where he died in 1984 at age 89. They had been married since 1926.         Mrs. Atkinson is survived by a son from a previous marriage, James Torrey MacIlveen of Huntsville; two grandsons, James Torrey MacIlveen of Decatur, Ala., and Dr. Robert Bruce MacIlveen of Portland, Ore., and six great-grandchildren.

        Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         In the more than 40 years that she was associated with the fashion world, she was called an oracle, the high priestess of fashion, a myth maker. She was the fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1937 to 1962, when she moved to Vogue. There, she was editor in chief until 1971.         Instead of resting on her laurels, she went on, as consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to a new career of staging annual fashion exhibitions that drew almost one million visitors a year and made the museum a center of fashion excitement for New York City and the world.         ''She was and remains the only genius fashion editor,'' Richard Avedon, the photographer, said yesterday. Their professional relationship at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue was the inspiration for the movie ''Funny Face'' starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.         Despite a predilection for aristocratic luxury that recalled the gracious days before World War I, she had an innate understanding of the extraordinary pace of change in 20th-century life. She had an eye for what was new and imaginative, and many fashion designers say she gave them a crucial boost at an early stage in their career.         Her sense of theater was evidenced in the way she moved - Cecil Beaton described her as ''an elegant crane picking her way out of a swamp'' -and the way she looked. Her cheeks and ear lobes were rouged, her lips and nails colored a clear red and her hair lacquered black until the end of her life.         She was fashionably thin, and her favorite costume when she was working or partygoing was narrow black pants with either a black turtleneck sweater or elaborate tunic, depending on the occasion. For years she wore her hair in a snood - it became a kind of trademark - and wore ankle-strap low-heel sandals.         She was born around the turn of the century in Paris - she was never very specific about her birth date - to the former Emily Key Hoffman, an American, and her husband, Frederick Y. Dalziel, who was Scottish. She had a younger sister, Alexandra.         ''We went to Venice or Deauville in the summer or wherever everybody else went,'' she said of her childhood in Europe. ''Our parents spent their days having a good time. They never contributed a bloody thing and they and all our friends lived the life of Riley.'' Ballet and Riding         In 1914, spurred by the onset of the war, the family moved to New York, where the Dalziel sisters went to ballet classes three times a week, learned to ride from Buffalo Bill Cody and occasionally attended schools such as Brearley for a few months. Diana Dalziel made her debut in 1922, and two years later, while vacationing in Saratoga, met and married T. Reed Vreeland, a banker who graduated from Yale the year she came out.         They lived in Albany for four years and had two sons, Thomas R. Vreeland Jr., who became an architect, and Frederick, who entered the diplomatic service. Then they moved to Europe, where for a brief time Diana Vreeland ran a lingerie shop in London. When they returned to the United States in 1936, she began writing a column for Harper's Bazaar called ''Why Don't You . . . .''         For a country in the midst of a Depression, it offered such heady suggestions as ''Why don't you put all your dogs in bright yellow collars and leads like all the dogs in Paris?'' or ''have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?'' It was widely satirized and widely read and the next year she was made fashion editor of the magazine. Made a Few Mistakes         During most of the 1960's, when fashion was in turmoil, she presided over Vogue magazine, where the fashion world took everything she said seriously and where she made a few apparent mistakes, such as having experimental photographs taken with a wide-angle lens that distorted the models, giving them big heads and tiny feet. Nevertheless, fashion photographers were widely influenced by those pictures and began trying to see what their lenses could do.         She breakfasted on tea and oatmeal, worked in bed in the mornings and showed up in her office around noon.         Her legend grew as her aphorisms were circulated within the fashion world. ''Pink,'' she said, ''is the navy blue of India.'' ''The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb.'' She pronounced Celanese, the American fabric company, as if it were Italian: chelahnayzay, and broke down corduroy to its original components: cord du roi.         She avoided the typewriter. ''Has anyone ever written a great love letter on a typewriter?'' she asked. ''A great suicide note?'' And she made pronouncements. Of Chanel, she said, ''her first customers were princesses and duchesses and she dressed them like secretaries and stenographers.''         During this period, she asked Giorgio di Sant'Angelo, who was working in plastics and sculpture, to make accessories and then clothes.         ''She sent me to Arizona,'' he said, ''with Veruschka, the model, four suitcases full of fabrics, wires and tape and told me to wrap and tie everything as I wanted and then she gave me eight pages in the magazine.'' Two Job Opportunities         When Oscar de la Renta came to New York from Paris with a letter of introduction, she invited him to tea. He had two job opportunities, he told her, one doing custom clothes for Elizabeth Arden, the other designing ready-to-wear for Christian Dior-New York.         ''What do you want to do with yourself?'' she asked.         ''I want to get into ready-to-wear because that's where the money is,'' he told her.         ''Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster,'' she advised. ''She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.''         ''That is exactly what happened,'' he said. ''And when I did go into ready-to-wear, she helped me. When I made all those gypsy clothes and the caftans in 1967, 1968, it was all Diana's suggestions.''         She had a sense of fantasy that enveloped both her own image and her friends.         ''Her thought process was very original,'' said Bill Blass, who became a friend of Mrs. Vreeland and her husband, who died in 1966. ''She always insisted I was British, no matter how many times I told her I was a hoosier from Indiana,'' Mr. Blass said. Last Career With Museum         Her last career, with the Metropolitan Museum, began in 1973 with a retrospective showing of Balenciaga's clothes, from his first collection in 1938 to the wedding dress he made in 1972 for the Duchess of Cadiz, General Francisco Franco's granddaughter, a month before he died.         The same year, she pulled together an exhibition called Innovative Designers in Paris, and each year there followed another eye-catcher that drew not only fashion enthusiasts but also people captivated by the color and drama of romantic Hollywood clothes, stylish American women (including Irene Castle, Isadora Duncan, Josephine Baker and Elsie de Wolfe), Russian peasants, the costumes of the Ballets Russes, fashions of the Hapsburg era, Yves Saint Laurent's designs, equestrian costumes, Chinese mandarin robes and dance clothes throughout history.         The parties that heralded the openings each fall became major New York events where figures prominent in art, social and fashion circles mingled for dinner and dancing in the museum; the evening was capped by a stroll through the exotically lighted display halls with appropriate music and the flash of photographers' lights. Mrs. Vreeland was in the center of the action at all the parties except the one for ''Dance'' in 1986, when her health was too fragile. 'Elegance Is Innate'         During the museum period, Mrs. Vreeland became the undisputed voice of the fashion world, and her presence at other parties and fashion openings was eagerly sought. She received awards from such diverse groups as the Italian fashion industry and the Rhode Island School of Design and she became a chevalier of the French National Order of Merit.         In a book of her favorite photographs and sketches edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and published by Doubleday in 1980, she continued her penchant for aphorisms. ''Elegance is innate,'' she wrote. ''It has nothing to do with being well dressed.'' She also said, ''I loathe narcissism, but I approve of vanity.''         In her memoirs, ''D. V.,'' published in 1984 by Alfred A. Knopf, she did not restrict her pronouncements to fashion. ''Chutney is marvelous,'' she wrote. ''I'm mad about it. To me, it's very imperial.'' And ''lettuce is divine, although I'm not sure it's really food.'' A Practical Slant         Sometimes her observations had a remarkably practical slant. ''Whatever the fashion,'' she wrote in The New York Times in 1977, ''the important thing is time for upkeep. We take it for granted that a girl gets the best she can for herself. But, if she doesn't keep it up, if it isn't in beautiful condition, if the shoes aren't cleaned before she wears them every day and her bag isn't cleaned and everything in it cleaned, she'll never look like anything.''         She was an early enthusiast on the subject of keeping fit, and the magazines she edited were filled with articles on exercise, skin and hair care and grooming long before these topics became major obsessions.         ''The body must stay fit,'' she once explained. ''Fit people like themselves much better.''         The woman who was sometimes described as having the profile of a cigar-store Indian told an interviewer once that ''you don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive,'' and her friends insist that she carried this maxim out in her own life.         ''Dinner alone with D. V. was one of the best ways I could think of to spend an evening,'' said Bill Blass.         She lived in a basically red apartment on Park Avenue decorated by Billy Baldwin with lots of pictures, patterns, bibelots and calculated clutter. When she was editor in chief at Vogue, she also had her office painted bright red. Link to Aristocratic Years         As fashion became more egalitarian during the later years of the 20th century, Diana Vreeland provided a link to the aristocratic years when it was the province exclusively of the very rich. At a time when most people were concerned with the practical qualities of synthetic fibers, she could speak of ''the feel of a perfect piece of silk'' as the ''greatest projection of pleasure.''         She had the theatrical knack of a Diaghilev, whom she greatly admired and whom she made the subject of one of her Metropolitan Museum exhibits along with the costumes for his Ballets Russes. For the increasingly computerized fashion industry, she was a symbol of the grandeur of the past when drama and imagination were all. She had a glimpse of that past in her early years in Europe. In recreating it in her later life, she smoothed out the bumps and made it seem more exhilarating than perhaps it ever was.         She is survived by her two sons, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is planned for the fall, with the date to be announced later.       
        Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         The Post's vice president for editorial and administration, Peter Faris, said she had died of cancer. Members of the Post staff said Mrs. Schiff had learned in May that she had cancer and had decided against being treated for it.         Mrs. Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker, used her family money to obtain the controlling stock of The Post in 1939. She sold it in 1976 to Rupert Murdoch, who sold it in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow.         Under her stewardship, the newspaper alternately made and lost money, and Mrs. Schiff constantly fretted that it would drive her into pauperdom. But she always managed to keep the newspaper afloat, seeing it outlast its competitors to become the only afternoon daily in New York City. She said in 1987 that she decided to sell the paper to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur, after The Post incurred heavy losses in the mid-1970's. Weak Competitor in '39         Mrs. Schiff bought a controlling interest in The Post in 1939 from J. David Stern at the urging of her second husband, George Backer. She had little business experience, and she later learned that she had assumed obligations for millions of dollars in severance pay if the paper closed.         Mrs. Schiff played only a peripheral role in the management of The Post in the first 10 years of her ownership. When she took active control, her new editor, James A. Wechsler, said the odds of its surviving were 1,000 to 1. Few would have challenged him. The Post was a weak third in the field of New York City afternoon dailies, behind The Journal-American and The World-Telegram, and it had been losing money for 20 years.         But the Post survived and prospered, becoming a liberal power in journalism while its powerful competitors collapsed, one by one. Even her critics agreed that most of the credit had to go to Mrs. Schiff. But they also said her success was partly attributable to personality traits for which they criticized her and to which she freely confessed: a fondness for gossip and scandal, a fear of becoming poor and a craving for power or, as she called it, influence. 'Men, Money & Magic'         Mrs. Schiff resumed her maiden name after her third divorce but decided that ''Mrs.'' was more appropriate than ''Miss'' for a grandmother. She described her private life in her diaries and other papers and in interviews. The book, ''Men, Money & Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,'' by Jeffrey Potter, was published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan in 1976.         Much of the book is devoted to her relationships with her husbands and male friends, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who persuaded her to build a home near his in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her biography suggested that their relationship had included sex and that it had been approved by Mr. Backer.         Mrs. Schiff came to regret what she called ''that awful book.'' In a statement volunteered for this obituary, she said, ''I want to make it very clear that President Roosevelt never made a suggestion that I become his girlfriend, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was just as good a friend as Mr. Roosevelt.'' Born on Fifth Avenue         Mrs. Schiff was born on March 11, 1903, in the Fifth Avenue apartment of her parents, Mortimer L. and Adele Neustadt Schiff. The apartment was a wedding gift from her grandfather, Jacob H. Schiff, a stern banker and the head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company.         As a girl, Dorothy - known to many as Dolly - was often treated coldly by her parents, each of whom had separate romantic and social interests. ''There was no joy in my growing up,'' she recalled. ''None, absolutely none.''         Later she would explain her refusal to grant bonuses or congratulations to Post staff members for good work by saying, ''They weren't given to me as a child, and any words I did receive were not ones of praise.''         She was, by her account, a bookish and sullen girl, associating solely with other young socialites at the Brearley School, Class of '20, on the Upper East Side. After her freshman year at Bryn Mawr College, where, she said, ''I flunked every single course, which is pretty hard to do,'' she set her heart on Richard B. W. Hall, a handsome socialite, though lacking in great wealth. Her parents opposed the match and, in classic fashion, sent her to Europe. But they finally yielded, in 1923. 'Rich at Last!'         Two children, Mortimer and Adele, were born in the first two years, but the marriage quickly turned cold.         After Mrs. Schiff's parents died in 1931, she said, she told her husband: ''My God, I'm rich at last! . . . And now I'm going to leave you.''         Mrs. Schiff said Mr. Hall had resented her Jewish origins as a social handicap. Shedding him, she abandoned a formal conversion to the Episcopal Church and gradually reverted to an old family concern for the fate of European Jewry.         She married Mr. Backer in 1932, because, Mrs. Schiff said, ''In those days, I thought it was important to be married, and since the substantial older ones had enough sense not to marry me, there wasn't much choice.'' Glamour and Politics         Until then, she had been, by her account, a socialite and a nominal Republican, interested chiefly in the glamour of the international set. He was a writer and a liberal Democrat, and he introduced her to the Algonquin Round Table and New Deal politics.         She joined the Roosevelt campaign in 1936 in a minor role and became active in welfare work. Three years later she gained control of The Post, ''with the understanding that I would pay the debts and the deficits,'' she said in 1987.         Mr. Backer became the nominal publisher and editor, and his wife was vice president and treasurer. She lost nearly $2 million the first two years as costs rose and circulation fell, to 190,000 from 250,000. Mrs. Schiff became terrified that the paper would bankrupt her.         She decided it needed a popular approach - a tabloid form, more comics and columns, and plenty of glamour, scandal and human-interest articles.         The features editor, Ted Thackrey, agreed. Mr. Backer did not. Marrying the Editor         Mrs. Schiff took over as publisher in 1942, separated from Mr. Backer and named Mr. Thackrey editor.         The publisher married the editor the next year, and while she was involved in buying radio and television stations, which were eventually sold, The Post under Mr. Thackrey was building circulation and cutting its losses.         The couple diverged on politics, and they publicized their disagreements in a series of columns during the 1948 Presidential campaign, he supporting the Progressive Party candidate, Henry A. Wallace, and she the Republican, Thomas E. Dewey. Both disliked Harry S. Truman, who won.         The Thackreys were divorced the next year. The Golden Age         To many readers and former Post staff writers, the era of James Wechsler's editorship, 1948 to 1961, was the newspaper's golden age. Talented reporters and columnists were hired, and although many features were about sex and celebrities, the paper also took on targets previously immune to critical coverage, like J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and Robert Moses.         From 1950 on, The Post was a money maker almost without interruption. But Mrs. Schiff never lost her sense of financial insecurity. She kept a tight rein on costs, gradually eliminating foreign and out-of-town coverage and permitting many skilled employees to leave for jobs that paid better.         She also kept a close watch on policy, conferring daily with department chiefs. Her decision in 1961 to name Paul Sann editor, making Mr. Wechsler the editorial page chief and a columnist, was generally perceived as favoring human interest over crusading.         As a publisher, she joined the strike-lockout that closed the daily newspapers in New York for 114 days beginning in December 1962. One month before the labor stoppage ended, she resumed publication because, she said, she had been snubbed in the negotiations by her male fellow publishers and because she feared that the continued stoppage might cause the death of weaker papers like The Post. Competition Dwindles         In fact, by 1966 The Daily Mirror had folded, and the morning New York Herald Tribune had merged with the big evening papers into The World Journal Tribune, familiarly dubbed The Widget.         ''I was petrified,'' Mrs. Schiff recalled. ''Here we had Jock Whitney, William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Jack Howard teaming up in the evening field.''         But an executive of the former Herald Tribune, Walter N. Thayer, reassured her, saying, ''It's an impossible three-headed thing.'' He was right. The paper closed a little more than a year later.         Mrs. Schiff then had the evening field to herself. She moved The Post from West Street to The Journal-American plant on South Street. She installed automated equipment and a spacious sixth-floor oval office for herself. The Sale to Murdoch         In December 1976, Mrs. Schiff startled the public and her staff by announcing the sale of The Post to Mr. Murdoch for $31 million. She did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed that she was pessimistic about the future of afternoon papers in the city.         ''The reason has been widely misconstrued,'' she said later in an interview. ''It was not sold for 'estate purposes.' Evening papers in urban areas have not survived. The Post had a deficit in 1975 and was a heavy loser in 1976, and I could no longer meet the deficits.''         In an interview last year, Mrs. Schiff said of her long ownership of the Post, ''It was a terrible headache.'' She said that she was then, in 1988, spending her time on needlepoint and other less stressful activities.         Mrs. Schiff married Rudolf Sonneborn, a Baltimore industrialist, in 1953. They separated in 1965 and were later divorced.         Surviving are the children of the first marriage, Mortimer W. Hall of Millbrook, N.Y., and Adele Hall Sweet, of Manhattan; a daughter from the second marriage, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, also of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
        Ann Honeycutt, an author and radio producer, was found dead on Tuesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and had been ill for some time after a stroke.         Ann Honeycutt, an author and radio producer, was found dead on Tuesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and had been ill for some time after a stroke.         Miss Honeycutt was co-author with James A. Kinney, a veterinarian, of ''How to Raise a Dog in the City, In the Suburbs,'' a highly praised book with drawings by James Thurber. It was published in 1939, and a revised edition appeared in 1969.         Miss Honeycutt, who moved to New York from Plain Dealing, La., was a producer for WOR in the radio station's infancy. She married the writer St. Clair McKelway, managing editor of The New Yorker magazine before Harold Ross.         She was recognized as an authority on Southern cooking and for a time operated her own catering service.         There are no survivors.       
        Margaret B. Parkinson, a book and magazine editor, died of pancreatic cancer Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and had homes in Manhattan and East Quogue, L.I.         Margaret B. Parkinson, a book and magazine editor, died of pancreatic cancer Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and had homes in Manhattan and East Quogue, L.I.         Miss Parkinson had been an editor at The Reader's Digest, Charm and Mademoiselle, a senior editor at Stein & Day, the managing editor of Parents Magazine, the editor in chief of Mason Charter Publishers and the executive editor of the Bobbs-Merrill Publishing Company. She was a graduate of the University of Colorado.         Survivors include a brother, Lucius, of Danville, Calif; three nieces and a nephew.       
        Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Miss Davis was en route to her home from the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain, where she had been honored for her acting career. She arrived in Paris on Tuesday and was to fly to Los Angeles, but was taken instead to the hospital, on the outskirts of Paris.         Her lawyer, Harold Schiff, said she had undergone a mastectomy in 1983.         ''The doctors had told us the cancer had spread, that it was terminal,'' he said. ''The doctors had said let her go on going about her business.'' #2 Oscars, 10 Nominations For more than a half century, Bette Davis reigned as a Hollywood star in the grandest meaning of the term. With her huge and expressive eyes, her flamboyant mannerisms and her distinctive speaking style, she left an indelible mark on her audiences in a wide variety of roles.         Nominated for 10 Oscars, Miss Davis was a perfectionist whose tempestuous battles for good scripts and the best production craftsmen for her films wreaked havoc in Hollywood executive suites.         ''I was a legendary terror,'' she once recalled. ''I was insufferably rude and ill-mannered in the cultivation of my career. I had no time for pleasantries. I said what was on my mind, and it wasn't always printable. I have been uncompromising, peppery, intractable, monomaniacal, tactless, volatile, and ofttimes disagreeable. I suppose I'm larger than life.''         She was indeed. Few in the entertainment industry could deny that Bette Davis possessed all the legendary indestructibility of the New England Yankee that she was. Starting as a stage actress, she won spectacular fame as a screen star and, as she grew old, shifted effortlessly to high-paying television roles.         Miss Davis's two Oscars for best performance by an actress were won in 1935, for ''Dangerous,'' and in 1938, for ''Jezebel.'' But perhaps she is best recalled for her tour de force as Margo Channing, the tough-talking but soft-hearted stage actress in ''All About Eve,'' for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.         She made almost 100 films. Her 10 nominations for Oscars are the most any actress has received. And she received many other honors, including the Life Achievement Award of the American Film Institute and the Cesar Award of the French film industry. In 1987 she received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievements in the performing arts.         The Kennedy Honors coincided with the release of ''The Whales of August,'' a film in which Miss Davis co-starred with Lillian Gish and for which she won wide critical praise. She appeared in that movie and in television and film roles despite having had a mastectomy and a series of strokes while hospitalized in 1983. ''It was my terror that I'd never work again,'' she said afterwards, ''for I have always very much loved to work.''         Last April 24, Miss Davis was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at its annual tribute, joining the company of such previous honorees as Sir Laurence Olivier and Charlie Chaplin. ''An honor I'm delighted to get,'' she said at the time. ''Greedy, greedy. Can't have too many awards. I've gotten just about every award there is.''  Enduring Popularity  'Acting Should Be Larger Than Life'         Although Miss Davis reached the apex of her popularity in films between the mid-1930's and the early 50's, her appeal swept across generations, due largely to her frequent appearances in made-for-television films and the repeated showings of her old, now-classic movies on television.         These classics include ''Of Human Bondage,'' ''Dark Victory,'' ''The Corn Is Green,'' ''The Letter,'' ''The Great Lie,'' ''A Stolen Life,'' ''Now, Voyager,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Petrified Forest'' and ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?''         New generations of entertainers, many of them female impersonators, have found her distinct mannerisms and clipped speech irresistible material for their acts.         ''Oh Petah, Petah, Petah,'' such an impersonator will say, rolling exaggeratedly widened eyes and puffing savagely on a cigarette. ''What a dump!'' And, inevitably, the memorable line that Margo Channing utters as she walks drunkenly up the stairs at her party: ''Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night.''         ''You know, I've learned from the imitators,'' Miss Davis said in an interview this year. ''I really have. I was never conscious I moved my elbow like that'' - she moved it from side to side - ''until I saw someone doing me.''         She was always proud of her approach to acting. ''Natural!'' she said. ''That isn't the point of acting. The public must believe us. They must also be somehow ennobled. Did I ever try to be low-key? Never, never, never! I fought that from the beginning. I think that acting should be larger than life.''  At First, Simply 'Betty'  A Broken Home And School Away         Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Mass., on April 5, 1908, Miss Davis came from a firmly rooted Yankee background. Her mother was the former Ruth Favor; her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, a Harvard Law School graduate who became a Government patent attorney.         Her father divorced her mother when Miss Davis was 7 and her sister, Barbara, was 5, leaving her mother to rear the children alone. In later years Miss Davis said many times that she saw the divorce as her father's abandonment of his family, and that it left her barren of love for him and preternaturally devoted to her doting mother.         Mrs. Davis put the girls in boarding school in Massachusetts and moved to New York. In 1917, she was joined by her daughters.         It was at about that time that ''Betty'' Davis took the more exotic-sounding name that would become world-famed. A friend of her mother's who was reading Balzac's ''La Cousine Bette'' suggested the name-spelling change, telling her that it would ''set you apart, my dear.''         In her teens, Miss Davis returned to New England, living in several towns there while her mother worked as a portrait photographer. She waited on tables at her schools, and once, to help with family expenses, posed nude for a woman making a sculpture.         Miss Davis decided in her teens that she wanted to become an actress, and her mother took her to New York in 1928, where she arranged for her to read for Eva Le Gallienne, whose Civic Repertory Theater was then one of the most popular touring companies.         ''Miss Le Gallienne thought I was not serious enough in my approach to warrant my attendance at her school,'' Miss Davis recalled years later.  Breaking Into the Business  Stage Experience, Looks and a Voice         Miss Davis's first professional acting job was with a winter stock company in Rochester, run by the director George Cukor, who dismissed her after a few months. She made her New York acting debut in 1929, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village, in Virgil Geddes's ''The Earth Between.'' Brooks Atkinson, critic for The New York Times, wrote that she was ''an entrancing creature.''         Successes and disappointments were to come in rapid order after that. The young actress, then only 21 years old, was in her first Broadway hit, ''Broken Dishes,'' quickly followed by ''Solid South,'' in which she played the beguilingly named Alabama Follensby, the first of many Southern-belle roles that were to come her way.         The movies had learned to talk only a few years earlier, and Hollywood was greedily spiriting away Broadway actors and actresses who had good speaking voices as well as looks. It was thus perhaps inevitable that a fresh young actress with some training and experience and a couple of good notices would be asked to take a screen test.         She was given a $300-a-week contract by Universal Pictures, and Miss Davis and her mother went to Los Angeles in 1930. Her first movie role was in ''Bad Sister,'' notable only for the fact that it also introduced Humphrey Bogart to films. But the movie's cinematographer, Karl Freund, passed the word to studio bosses that ''Davis has lovely eyes,'' and just as she was to be dropped, her option was picked up for another 13 weeks.         By the end of 1932, Miss Davis, discouraged after having appeared in six lackluster movies and finally without a contract, prepared to return with her mother to New York. Then she got a call from George Arliss, the highly respected English actor, who was to be her mentor until his death.         He hired Miss Davis as his leading lady in ''The Man Who Played God,'' her breakthrough movie role.         The film was a success, and its producer, Warner Brothers, signed Miss Davis to her first contract. It was the start of a love-hate relationship with the studio that was characterized by Miss Davis's frequent storming off sets, being suspended for refusing to act in what she considered inferior movies, and going to court to sever her ties with Warners.         But in her first three years at Warners Miss Davis made 14 films, including Edna Ferber's ''So Big,'' with Barbara Stanwyck starring, and ''20,000 Years in Sing Sing,'' which was, she was to say, ''my only film with the great Spencer Tracy, to my everlasting regret.''         ''He was the finest actor I ever worked with,'' she said.  Getting Parts, and Noticed  Unafraid to Play The Villainess         She was working hard, in mostly forgettable fare, but Miss Davis was also learning the movie craft and earning the respect of technicians.         From the start Miss Davis, unlike leading ladies of the day, had no qualms about playing unsympathetic roles, and so was overjoyed in 1934 when she was lent by Warners to the rival RKO studios to play the cruel and slatternly waitress Mildred in W. Somerset Maughham's ''Of Human Bondage,'' opposite Leslie Howard as the crippled hero Philip.         ''Every actor who becomes a star is usually remembered for one or two roles,'' she said, ''like Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz', Garbo in 'Camille,' Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire.' Mildred in 'Of Human Bondage' was such a role for me. She was the first leading-lady villainess ever played on a screen for real.''         ''It's odd that people remember me best for my evil roles,'' she said, ''since I played so many other kinds of characters. But villains always have the best-written parts.''         She was widely praised for her performance as Mildred and nominated for an Academy Award, but she failed to win one, mostly, she said, because Warner Brothers did not want to promote an Oscar for a film it did not produce. She came to regard the Oscar that she won the next year, for ''Dangerous,'' as ''a consolation prize.''         She was always proud of her two Oscars, though, and said this year: ''I'm not a bit modest about them. I don't use those boys for door stops.''         Warners was treating her with new respect, giving her movies like ''The Petrified Forest,'' with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, but Miss Davis harbored a festering resentment against what she called ''the contract slave system'' at the studio.         Deciding in 1936 to defy the strictures of her contract, Miss Davis agreed with an English company to go to London to make two movies. Years later she was to ruefully confess that before she left, Jack L. Warner, the studio head, offered her a chance ''to play one of the great screen roles of all time, but I didn't know it.''         '' 'Please don't leave. I just bought a wonderful book for you,' '' she quoted Mr. Warner as saying. ''And I said, 'I'll bet it's a pip!' and walked out of his office.'' She learned later that the role she turned down was Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' Mr. Warner later gave up his option on it.  The Glorious Years  Memorable Roles, One After Another         In England, Miss Davis was sued by Warner Brothers, which succeeded in preventing her from working for another producer while under contract to Warners. But once she had returned to the United States, Warners gave her a new contract calling for fewer pictures at a much higher salary.         They also gave her excellent, high-budget pictures, like ''Jezebel,'' for which she won her second Oscar in 1938. In a single year, 1939, Warners released no fewer than four blockbuster Davis movies: ''Dark Victory,'' ''Juarez,'' ''The Old Maid'' and ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex,''         ''Jezebel'' began her halcyon years, she said, and ''in 1939 I secured my career and my stardom forever; I made five pictures in 12 months, and every one of them made money.''         The memorable Davis roles continued in swift order: The murderous and unfaithful planter's wife in Maugham's ''The Letter'' in 1940, quickly followed the next year by ''The Great Lie'' and ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the scheming Regina Giddens. In 1942 she scored again in ''Now, Voyager,'' as Charlotte Vale, a frumpish spinster who blossoms into a confident beauty and finds true love with Paul Henreid. The film is remembered by movie buffs for the scenes in which Mr. Henreid lights two cigarettes at once and gives one to Miss Davis.         There were other triumphs in the 1940's - ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' ''Watch on the Rhine,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''A Stolen Life.'' But Miss Davis's luck began to run out with critical and box-office disasters like ''Winter Meeting'' and ''Deception,'' and in 1949 Warner Brothers, after 19 years, released her from her contract while she was making the ludicrous melodrama ''Beyond the Forest.'' In it a by-then plumpish Miss Davis uttered one of her most famous ''camp'' lines, so often used by her mimics, ''What a dump!''  Anguish and Acclaim  Role of a Lifetime In 'All About Eve'         With the end of the Warners era, Miss Davis's third marriage, to William Grant Sherry, an artist by whom she had a daughter, Barbara Davis Sherry, was also ending. She won custody of her daughter.         Miss Davis had previously been married to Harmon Oscar Nelson Jr., a band leader, and she said in 1982 that on his insistence she had two abortions. ''That's what he wanted,'' she said. ''Being the dutiful wife, that's what I did.'' The marriage ended in divorce.         But for decades afterward, Miss Davis publicly battled with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, insisting that she had bestowed her first husband's middle name on the Oscar. ''The Academy has fought stoically to claim that they named the Oscar,'' she said. ''But of course I did. I named it after the rear end of my husband. Why? Because that's what it looked like.''         Miss Davis's second husband, Arthur Farnsworth, a businessman, died of head injuries suffered in a fall in 1943.         Miss Davis was filming ''Payment on Demand'' in 1949 - it was not released until 1951 - when she was offered a role of a lifetime in what she was to call ''that charmed movie, 'All About Eve.' '' She was a last-minute replacement for Claudette Colbert, for whom the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, had written the role of Margo Channing, the fading Broadway star. Miss Colbert was unable to begin the film on schedule because she ''hurt her back, thank God,'' as Miss Davis liked to recall it.         ''When I finished reading 'All About Eve' I was on Cloud Nine,'' said the actress. ''That night Joe Mankiewicz told me Margo Channing was the kind of dame who would treat her mink coat like a poncho.''         She played Margo that way, and brilliantly, and with the aid of a witty, literate script, sharp direction by Mr. Mankiewicz, and a sparkling cast that included Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, George Sanders, Marilyn Monroe (in a supporting role), and Thelma Ritter, the movie became one of the all-time great Hollywood films.         During the filming of ''All About Eve,'' Miss Davis became romantically involved with her leading man, Gary Merrill, and they were married in 1950. Soon afterward they adopted two children, Margot and Michael.  The 'Darkest Decade'  A Broadway Flop, A Retreat to Maine         Miss Davis received another Oscar nomination for ''The Star,'' released in 1953, but the film was unsuccessful. She was by then 45 and younger actresses were being offered the parts that would have once been hers. She accepted an offer to return to Broadway in a revue, ''Two's Company.''         When the show opened in New York in December 1952, Miss Davis recalled years later, ''The ovation was, to say the least, heartwarming, the reviews were bloodcurdling.'' The revue closed after 90 performances.         Miss Davis and Mr. Merrill took an option to buy a home in Maine and, she said with wry amusement, ''We called our house Witch Way because we didn't know which way we were going and a witch lived there. Guess who?''         ''For three years I was solely a wife and mother and Gary fell out of love with me,'' Miss Davis was to say years later. During that period it also became apparent that the Merrills' adopted daughter, Margot, was retarded, and at the age of 3 she had to be put in a special school. Margot has since lived in homes for the retarded.         During what she was to call her ''darkest decade,'' the 1950's, while the the Merrills' marriage continued to disintegrate, Miss Davis again played Elizabeth I in ''The Virgin Queen'' and a year later, in 1956, appeared in Paddy Chayefsky's ''A Catered Affair'' as Ma Hurley, a Bronx housewife, which she sometimes said was her favorite role. The Merrills also traveled cross-country doing one-night stands in ''The World of Carl Sandburg'' until 1960, when they were divorced.  Friends and Enemies  Fonda, Crawford, Cagney and Flynn         Having settled into character acting, Miss Davis in 1961 scored a success as the gin-soaked ''bag lady'' Apple Annie in ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' That same year she was praised for her performance on Broadway in Tennessee Wiliams's ''The Night of the Iguana,'' which she left in April 1962 to film ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' a box-office winner that earned her yet another Accademy Award nomination for best actress of the year.         The horror movie, in which Miss Davis wore pasty white makeup and padded herself to appear overweight, revolved around two show-business has-been sisters living in creepy seclusion in a Hollywood mansion. The role of the loony Baby Jane Hansen, addled into thinking she was going to make a comeback in vaudeville, gave Miss Davis a chance to pull out all the acting stops, and she did so with relish. The other, wheelchair-bound, sister was played by Joan Crawford.         The casting of Miss Davis and Miss Crawford in ''Baby Jane'' resuscitated longstanding rumors that they had feuded when both were Warners stars. In 1982 Miss Davis told an interviewer, ''I never feuded with Joan Crawford. During 'Baby Jane' the whole world hoped we would fight but we did not. We were both pros.'' In any event, Miss Davis was not reticent about revealing her rancor against other performers. She accused Miriam Hopkins, with whom she co-starred in ''The Old Maid'' and ''Old Acquaintance,'' of upstaging her and scene-stealing. She also disliked Errol Flynn, her co-star in ''Elizabeth and Essex,'' calling him ''unprofessional.''         Intense as her rivalries were, her friendships were deep and long lasting, particularly for Claude Rains, Henry Fonda, James Cagney, Paul Henreid, Olivia de Havilland, Anne Baxter and Geradine Fitzgerald.         As she grew older, Miss Davis continued making movies, many of them horror thrillers or melodramas, like ''The Anniversary'' (1968), in which she wore a patch over one eye.         Unlike many of her contemporaries who held out against appearing on television when it was in its infancy in the 1950's, Miss Davis embraced it. She appeared as a guest on the Jimmy Durante comedy show, and made episodes of popular series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Perry Mason.''  Writing Her Own Epitaph  'The Sweetness Of My Joy'         Despite advancing age Miss Davis kept on working, appearing on television and in an occasional movie, some of them made for television. She said she worked into her later years because the money came in handy, and work was part of her Yankee heritage. ''It is only work that truly satisfies,'' she said. ''No one has ever understood the sweetness of my joy at the end of a good day's work. I guess I threw everything else down the drain.''         This included her personal life, she said, adding: ''All my marriages were charades, and I was equally responsible. But I always fell in love. That was the original sin.''         It was never a secret that Miss Davis was temperamental, opinionated and often difficult to get along with, but in 1985 a scandalous book about her, by her own daughter, shocked her critics as well as her fans.         In ''My Mother's Keeper,'' B. D. Hyman portrayed Miss Davis as an abusive, domineering and hateful mother and as a grotesque alcoholic who was largely responsible for her own mistreatment by certain of her husbands. Two years later Miss Davis replied to Mrs. Hyman's charges with her own bestseller, 'This 'N That,'' in which she defended herself as the victim of a lying and ungrateful child. She confessed later that her estrangement from her daughter pained her.         For some years after her last divorce Miss Davis lived in Weston, Conn., but in the late 1970's she moved into an apartment in West Hollywood.         ''Indestructible,'' she once said. ''That's the word that's often used to describe me. I suppose it means that I just overcame everything. But without things to overcome, you don't become much of a person, do you?''         ''I know what I want as my epitaph,'' she said. ''Here lies Ruth Elizabeth Davis - she did it the hard way.''         Correction:  November 11, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Oct. 8 about Bette Davis credited her incorrectly with a distinction held by another actress.         As a letter from a reader has pointed out, it is Katharine Hepburn who has received the most Academy Award nominations. The obituary also included a film incorrectly among Miss Davis's nominations. She was not nominated for the 1934 film ''Of Human Bondage.''

        Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         In her long and prolific career as a novelist, memoirist, journalist and critic, Miss McCarthy earned recognition for her cool, analytic intelligence and her exacting literary voice - a voice capable of moving from the frivolously feminine to the willfully cerebral, from girlish insouciance to bare-knuckled fury.         In 1984, she was awarded both the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to literature and the National Medal for Literature.  'A Subversive Soul'         ''If there were any real ancestor among American women for Mary McCarthy it might be Margaret Fuller,'' the critic Elizabeth Hardwick, a friend, once observed, referring to the 19th-century American editor, essayist, poet, teacher and translator. ''Both women have will power, confidence and a subversive soul sustained by exceptional energy.''         Miss McCarthy's accounts of sexual shenanigans in ''The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt'' in 1941 and ''The Group'' in 1963 created something of an uproar when they first appeared. But her notoriety in literary circles stemmed less from the scandal quotient of her fiction than from her adversarial literary and political stands. She had celebrated public skirmishes with Philip Rahv, Diana Trilling and Lillian Hellman; issued vitriolic pronouncements on Watergate and the Vietnam War, and became known for the ferocity of her book and theater reviews.  Perverse Opinions         At their worst, those reviews pointed up Miss McCarthy's weakness for catchy one-liners and her taste for willfully perverse opinions. Of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' she wrote, ''His work reeks of literary ambition as the apartment reeks of cheap perfume,'' and of Eugene O'Neill and ''The Iceman Cometh'' she declared, ''He is probably the only man in the world who is still laughing at the Iceman joke or pondering its implications.''         Yet at her best (as in ''The Stones of Florence'') Miss McCarthy was an erudite cultural historian, using her familiarity with history, politics and the arts - and the application of some plain old-fashioned common sense -to draw surprising connections and to make her readers reconsider their preconceptions.         ''A career of candor and dissent is not an easy one for a woman; the license is jarring and the dare often forbidding,'' Ms. Hardwick said. ''Such a person needs more than confidence and indignation. A great measure of personal attractiveness and a high degree of romantic singularity are necessary to step free of the mundane, the governessy, the threat of earnestness and dryness. Moderating influences are essential.''         In the case of Miss McCarthy, she said, ''the purity of style and the liniment of her wit, her gay summoning of the funny facts of everyday life, soften the scandal of the action or the courage of the opinion.''         To Robert Lowell, Miss McCarthy was ''our Diana, rash to awkwardness,'' blurting ''ice clear'' sentences above the ''mundane gossip and still more mundane virtue'' of her colleagues. To Alfred Kazin, she was the owner of ''a wholly destructive critical mind,'' a critic with an ''unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person.'' And to Norman Mailer, she was ''our First Lady of Letters'' -''our saint, our umpire, our lit arbiter, our broadsword, our Barrymore (Ethel), our Dame (dowager), our mistress (Head), our Joan of Arc.''  Heroines Were Self-Portraits         The most tireless mythologizer of her life, however, remained Miss McCarthy herself. There were her memoirs: ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' (1957), the beautifully observed portrait of her painful youth, and the later, more workmanlike ''How I Grew,'' published in 1987. In addition, the heroines in Miss McCarthy's fiction form a sort of continuing portrait of the author: Meg in ''The Company She Keeps'' (1942), the clever Vassar girl, ''a princess among the trolls''; Martha, ''the bohemian lady'' in ''A Charmed Life'' (1955), whose need to ''tell the truth'' continually gets her into trouble; Kay, the skeptical iconoclast in ''The Group'' (1963), and Rosamund, the esthetic mother figure in ''Birds of America'' (1971).         These novels also included sharp-edged portraits of many of Miss McCarthy's friends and lovers: her second husband, the critic Edmund Wilson, was portrayed as a loud, unappealing intellectual in ''A Charmed Life''; and Rahv, her roommate and mentor as editor of The Partisan Review, turned up in ''The Oasis'' (1949).         Yet if Miss McCarthy's novels often read like thinly disguised exercises in autobiography, they also attempted to provide an idiosyncratic chronicle of American life - at least within her own intellectual set - as it changed over some five decades. Sexual freedom in the 1930's, radicalism in the 40's and 50's, Vietnam and the social upheavals of the 60's, Watergate and terrorism in the 70's - these are the larger issues that flicker in the background of the novels.  Fiction Was Difficult         There is a certain didacticism to these books, a feeling of willed creation, and Miss McCarthy herself acknowledged that she found it considerably more difficult to write fiction than essays or reviews.         Each novel, she once said, had its genesis with an idea. ''Birds of America,'' which chronicled the coming of age of a teen-age ornithologist, was meant to be ''a novel about the idea of equality and its relation to nature''. ''The Groves of Academe'' (1952), a satiric portrait of a scheming scholar and his colleagues, was intended to address the question ''Where is the justice for an impossible person?'' ''The Group,'' a chatty gossip sheet about the lives of eight Vassar women, was conceived as a study of the illusory idea of social and political progress that captivated so many young people in the 1930's.         That last novel, which brought Miss McCarthy both a popular audience and a movie sale, enhanced her almost legendary reputation for enraging old friends and acquaintances who thought they saw themselves as the thinly disguised and gleefully skewered characters in her fiction.  A Painful Childhood         Throughout her career, Miss McCarthy seemed preoccupied with two themes: what she called ''the idea of justice'' and the idea of self-reliance. Both impulses originated in her painful childhood, and both, in a sense, led to her later attempts to invent an identity true to her platonic conception of herself.         Mary Therese McCarthy was born on June 21, 1912, in Seattle, the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy, a member of a prominent Roman Catholic family in Minneapolis, and the former Therese Preston, whose father, a transplanted New Englander, was one of Seattle's most successful lawyers. She had three brothers, Kevin, Preston and Sheridan.         The early years of Miss McCarthy's life seem to have been a romantic idyll; she would later portray them as a lovely succession of parties and holidays, with May baskets and valentines.         ''Both my parents were handsome, winning and romantic,'' she wrote. ''Their marriage was opposed by both families, partly for religious reasons, and partly because my father was an invalid, with an invalid's febrile vitality. He had a bad heart, and it was prophesied, from the first, that he would die young and leave his wife with a pack of children.''  'Dickensian Cruelty'         In fact, both he and his wife died in the great flu epidemic of 1918, and the 6-year-old Mary and her three brothers were sent to live with their great-aunt Margaret and her husband in Minneapolis. There, they experienced what she once called ''circumstances of almost Dickensian cruelty and squalor.'' The children were made to stand outdoors for three hours at a time in the snow, and they were regularly thrashed with a razor strop; Miss McCarthy recalled being beaten in one instance for receiving a school prize, lest she become ''stuck up.''         Miss McCarthy's bitter recollection continued: ''Two blocks away, my McCarthy grandparents, dwelling in sumptuous middle-class style, instilled in us the contrast between wealth and penury by occasional treats and vacations; it was thought beneficial that we should know we were orphans and fitted for a different destiny than our well-tended cousins.         ''Today, some of my relations allege my literary successes and my brother Kevin's career as an actor as proof that the harsh formula followed in our upbringing produced results; nevertheless, I cannot feel grateful. Nor do I believe that artistic talent flowers necessarily from a wounding of the stem on which it grows.''         When she was 11, Miss McCarthy was rescued from her misery in Minneapolis by her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, who took her to Seattle and gave her a fine education at the Forest Ridge Convent and the Annie Wright Seminary.  Puritanism vs. Romance         As ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' and ''How I Grew'' indicate, the twists and turns of Miss McCarthy's melodramatic childhood would develop two distinct sides to her personality: on one hand, the puritanical student who wants to win prizes for her scholarship and dreams of becoming a nun; on the other, the die-hard romantic who writes moody stories about suicide and prostitution and dreams of becoming an actress. In fact, before she left for college in 1929, Miss McCarthy took some acting classes at the Cornish Drama School in Seattle, where she met the actor Harold Cooper Johnsrud, whom she married a week after her graduation from Vassar. She would divorce him three years later.         By the time Miss McCarthy left Vassar in 1933, she said, she had become ''a wayward modern girl,'' determined, in the words of her colleague William Barrett, ''to hold her own with men - both intellectually and sexually.'' Her finely observed collection of interconnected stories, ''The Company She Keeps,'' would chronicle - in slightly disguised fashion - many of her adventures in these early post-college years, including the breakup of her first marriage, her desultory love affairs and her dabbling in Trotskyite politics.         Writing of that time, Mr. Barrett described the girlishly pretty writer as ''a Valkyrie maiden, riding her steed into the circle, amid thunder and lightning, and out again, bearing the body of some dead hero across her saddle.''         Two influential men of letters, Rahv and Wilson, would play important roles in the shaping of Miss McCarthy's career. Rahv, with whom she lived during the 1930's, helped her to get her first literary job - writing theater reviews for the magazine; Wilson, whom she married in 1938, persuaded her to try writing fiction. He put her in a room, she recalled, and told her to stay there until she finished a story. Their tempestuous marriage produced one son, Reuel, and ended in divorce in 1946. Later that year she married Bowden Broadwater, a writer and teacher.  Satiric Wit         With a clinical eye and an apparently total gift for recall, Miss McCarthy used her satiric wit to illuminate the pretensions and prejudices of her fellow intellectuals. Much of her writing was devoted to exposing what she regarded as the ignorance, bigotry, dishonest sentimentality and affectation that cluttered the intellectual marketplace.         She defended Hannah Arendt and William Burroughs when it was fashionable to assail them, and attacked J. D. Salinger, Kenneth Tynan and Arthur Miller when others were singing their praises.         The litigious Lillian Hellman was so incensed, in 1980, by Miss McCarthy's description of her in a television interview as a ''dishonest writer'' that she instituted a $2.25 million defamation suit.         Hellman's death in 1984 placed the lawsuit in limbo, making Miss McCarthy feel somewhat put out. ''I still feel disgusted by the amount of lying that didn't stop,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I wanted it to go to trial, so I was disappointed when she died.''  Busy Despite Health Problems         Miss McCarthy married James Raymond West, a former director of information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 1961. They divided their time between an apartment in Paris and their house in Maine.         In addition to her husband and son, Miss McCarthy is survived by two stepsons, Daniel West of Los Angeles and Jonathan West of Lodz, Poland; a stepdaughter, Alison West of Manhattan; two brothers, Kevin, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Preston, of Millsboro, Del., and two grandchildren.         In recent years, Miss McCarthy had several operations for hydrocephalus (water on the brain), but maintained a hectic schedule, working on another volume of memoirs, contemplating a study of Gothic architecture, teaching literature at Bard College and learning German. She recalled telling a friend some two decades ago that she ''never woke up in the morning without a feeling of intense repentance and a resolve to be better.''         ''I don't do that anymore - or almost never,'' she said in a recent interview. ''But I do have this idea of improvement, if not in one's powers, at least in one's vision, in one's understanding. I suppose it's all tied up with the American belief in progress. Not that I have that as an idea, but I certainly have it in my personal life. I couldn't live without feeling I know more than I did yesterday.''

        Ellen Lewis Buell Cash, former children's books editor of The New York Times Book Review, died yesterday in Chattanooga, Tenn. She was 84 years old.         Ellen Lewis Buell Cash, former children's books editor of The New York Times Book Review, died yesterday in Chattanooga, Tenn. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Cash, who was known professionally as Ellen Lewis Buell, ended her 32-year career as a member of the Sunday book review staff in July 1963, retiring to the Cash family farm in Wildwood, Ga., south of Chattanooga.         While working in the world of children's books, she saw the juvenile publishers' annual output of books soar from about 400 titles in the early 1930's to more than 2,300 in 1962.         She was a native of Marietta, Ohio, the daughter of Daniel Hand Buell and the former Ellen Lewis Nye. After graduating from Marietta College, she held a reporting job on her hometown paper in Marietta, then headed for New York City in 1931.         After being hired for The Book Review at The Times, she served as a clerk and secretary, listed new books, answered readers' queries and tried her hand at reviews.         In 1935, The Times decided to institute a regular weekly page on children's books, and Mrs. Cash was assigned to share responsibility for the page with Anne Thaxter Eaton on alternate weeks. When Miss Eaton retired in 1946, Mrs. Cash turned full time to the job of children's editor.         From 1945 to 1961, she taught a course in juvenile literature at Columbia University. She was the author of an anthology for children, ''A Treasury of Little Golden Books,'' and a poetry anthology, ''Read Me a Poem: Children's Favorite Poetry.''         During her retirement, she and her husband, the late Harold Cash, a sculptor, maintained the Cash family farm.         She is survived by several cousins. A funeral service will be held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Chattanooga at 3 P.M. on Friday.

        Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         As one of the city's earliest and most notable female lawyers, Mrs. Buttenwieser bore the admiration of younger generations modestly, with self-deprecating humor and candor. When the City Bar Association honored her last year at an annual dinner, she noted dryly, ''I'd rather be reading a book.''         As a scion of a powerful family, she followed in its tradition of advocacy, philanthropy and concern for social issues. ''Public service is an obligation,'' Mrs. Buttenwieser once declared. 'Embodied the Concept'         Two passions ruled her professional life: the law and civil liberties. They merged when she became the first chairwoman of the Legal Aid Society, an organization she served for more than 50 years.         ''She embodied the concept of public service, and that her profession recognize its responsibility to people unable to represent themselves,'' said Alexander D. Forger, the current chairman of the Legal Aid Society and chairman of the Manhattan law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. As Legal Aid's first chairwoman, she nevertheless insisted on being referred to as chairman, rather than chairperson.         ''That was her style,'' Mr. Forger said. ''She was of the old school, where matters of gender were less important than doing the job.''         Mrs. Buttenwieser, who was born in Manhattan, was the daughter of two leading figures of ''our crowd,'' the 100 or so German Jewish families who founded leading banking, securities and retailing empires. Her mother, Adele Lewisohn, was the daughter of Adolph Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. Her uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, was a New York Governor and a United States Senator from New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, was Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals. Worked in Settlement House         After two years at Connecticut College, she left and enrolled at the New York School of Social Work. Then, she worked in child guidance in a settlement house. In 1930, she was appointed to the Board of Child Welfare. She turned to the law when she aspired to a judgeship in what is now Family Court.         In 1929, she married Benjamin J. Buttenwieser, a partner in the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. In a typical ''our crowd'' twist, one of her husband's partners wed her sister, and the firm later merged with Lehman Brothers, the family firm.         She graduated from New York University Law School and became the first woman to work at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. She left after a year because of the impending birth of a child.         Mrs. Buttenwieser then set out to fashion a life that would enable her to fuse work, family and community service. She founded her own office and practiced law in Manhattan for 50 years, until she retired in 1986. ''I decided when you get to be 80, you retire,'' she said. A Busy Volunteer         Her volunteer activities continued throughout her life and included many firsts. In 1939, she was the first chairwoman of a standing committee of the New York County Bar Association. Ten years later, she was elected trustee of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company, the first female director of a prominent banking concern.         She was chairwoman of the New York City Committee on Adoptions and often served as a pro bono lawyer for children's aid organizations. Mrs. Buttenwieser and her husband frequently opened their home to foster children.         When asked how she had been able to accomplish so much, she often credited ''a good husband.'' The two were a familiar sight at their regular table at Le Perigord, where they dined every Saturday at 8 P.M. precisely and where they recently celebrated their 60th anniversary.         Mr. Buttenwieser, a prominent philanthropist and civic leader, nurtured his wife's career and shared her causes. Mrs. Buttenwieser, as a tireless defender of Alger Hiss, the former State Department official who was convicted of perjury in 1950 after trials that mesmerized the nation, was the host for Sunday brunches at her home, where the defendant and his advisers and friends would gather. 'Fundamental Values'         ''She was a woman of great spirit and fundamental values - human rights, decency and the quality of individuals,'' said Oscar M. Ruebhausen, a longtime neighbor and retired partner of Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm that defended Mr. Hiss.         Mrs. Buttenwieser put her money where her beliefs were. She was an investor in The Nation, the liberal magazine. She formed a coalition of small family foundations, Joint Foundation Support, to serve philanthropists by providing information on the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.         She was also a former trustee of the New York Civil Liberties Union, a former board member of the Citizens Committee for Children, a former chairwoman of Madison House, a former president of the New York Federation of Jewish Charities, a former board member of the Legal Defense Fund and a former member of the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary.         She was a donor of Adele Lehman Hall at Barnard College, named for her mother, and was a former trustee of Connecticut College and a former board member of the Columbia University School of Social Work and the Dalton School.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Frances L. Loeb of Manhattan; three sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, Peter, of Philadelphia, and Paul, of Boston; nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.       
        Dr. Pearl Ma, who was chief of microbiology at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Manhattan, died of cancer Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to word received at the hospital here. Dr. Ma was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan until she returned recently to her native Hong Kong.         Dr. Pearl Ma, who was chief of microbiology at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Manhattan, died of cancer Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to word received at the hospital here. Dr. Ma was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan until she returned recently to her native Hong Kong.         Dr. Ma was an internationally known research specialist in microbiology and parasitology.         In recent years, she devoted much of her time to investigating the origins of cryptosporidiosis, a disease common among AIDS victims and one that can cause potentially fatal diarrhea.         Dr. Ma was co-editor with Dr. David Armstrong of the book, ''Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and Infections of Homosexual Men,'' published by Yorke Medical Books in 1984. A prolific author of scientific articles, she presented her findings at many professional gatherings, including the international conference on AIDS held in Montreal earlier this year. Served on AIDS Panel         Dr. Ma, who held a Ph.D. in microbiology from Jefferson University, was assistant professor of clinical pathology at the New York University School of Medicine at the time of her death. She was also a member of the New York City Health Department's task force on AIDS and was chairwoman of the advisory committee on parasitology for the city's Bureau of Laboratories.         She came to the United States after World War II and received a bachelor's degree from Rosemont College in Pennsylvania and a master's in microbiology from the University of Pennsylvania.         Before joining St. Vincent's in 1970 as head of its microbiology department, she was chief of microbiology and cytogenetics and director of clinical pathology at Akron (Ohio) City Hospital.         She is survived by her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Chiu Ki Ma of Kong Kong, and eight brothers and sisters.       
        May Garelick McClintock, an author and editor of children's books, died of cancer Wednesday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         May Garelick McClintock, an author and editor of children's books, died of cancer Wednesday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. McClintock, who wrote under the name May Garelick, was born in Russia and brought to the United States when she was nine months old. She was educated in the New York City public schools and in the early 1950's joined the children's book publishers William R. Scott.         She had a long career in positions ranging from clerical worker to production manager and editor. As an editor, she identified and developed new talent and helped publish the early work of Maurice Sendak, Miriam Schlein, Leonard Kessler and Barbara Brenner.         She wrote more than a dozen children's books, mostly in answer to questions posed to her by a child. ''Where Does the Butterfly Go When It Rains?'', published in 1961 by W. R. Scott, was one of her most popular. Other titles included ''What's Inside?,'' ''What Makes a Bird a Bird?,'' ''Manhattan Island,'' ''Double Trouble,'' ''About Owls,'' ''Two Orphan Cubs'' and ''Down to the Beach.'' Her latest book, ''Just My Size,'' is scheduled to be published in 1990 by Harper & Row.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Esther McCoy, an architectural historian and critic, died of emphysema on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 85 years old.         Esther McCoy, an architectural historian and critic, died of emphysema on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 85 years old.         A specialist in West Coast architecture, Ms. McCoy was the author of many books and hundreds of articles in leading architectural publications.         ''It was she, almost single-handedly, who awakened serious scholars to the extraordinary richness of California architecture,'' wrote Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for The New York Times, when a new edition of Ms. McCoy's 1960 work, ''Five California Architects,'' appeared in 1975. Her book, he added, was largely responsible for rescuing the five almost-forgotten architects - Bernard Maybeck, Irving Gill, R. M. Schindler and Charles and Henry Greene - from obscurity.         Calling Ms. McCoy ''the pre-eminent writer of California architecture,'' Cesar Pelli, a former dean of the Yale School of Architecture, told The Times in an interview five years ago, ''Our knowledge of Southern California architecture has been primarily formed by her research, her first-hand knowledge and her writing, which is so precise and passionate.''         She was born in Coffeyville, Kan., and was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. She began her career in New York writing architecture reviews for a number of publishers.         She worked as a draftsman in the Hollywood office of R. M. Schindler from 1944 to 1947 and began writing about the architects she had come to know. In 1985, she was given the American Institute of Architects' national honor award for excellence.         She is survived by a sister, Ruth Hahn of Denver, Colo., and a nephew, John McCoy of Shanghai.       
        May Swenson, a poet known for her cerebral, playful verse, and a recipient two years ago of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died yesterday in Ocean View, Del. She was 76 years old and had been suffering from chronic asthma.         May Swenson, a poet known for her cerebral, playful verse, and a recipient two years ago of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died yesterday in Ocean View, Del. She was 76 years old and had been suffering from chronic asthma.         Miss Swenson, who came to New York half a century ago from her birthplace, Logan, Utah, published her first collection of poems, ''Another Animal,'' in 1954. That book led the critic John Ciardi to declare: ''May Swenson is not a promise, but a fact. She has daring, a true feeling for the structure of the whole poem, precision of phrase, and a magic eye for the exact image.''         In all, Miss Swenson published nine volumes of poems, many of which first appeared in The New Yorker. Unlike many of her counterparts, she did not treat poetry as a tragic expression, a mode of despair. She was associated instead with a more joyful, clever, often lighthearted sensibility. In her poem ''Analysis of Baseball,'' she wrote:  It's done  on a diamond,  and for fun.  It's about  home, and it's  about run.         She transformed her daily experiences - a walk in fresh snow, a view of the surface of water, the observation of a bee sipping nectar from a yellow rose - into objects of art. She was able, as one critic wrote, to make her readers see what they had only glanced at before. 'A Dazzling Technician''         In 1979, when her collection ''New and Selected Things Taking Place'' was published, a reviewer in The New York Times spoke of Miss Swenson's ''refreshing delight in the metaphysically absurd.'' The poet and critic Anne Stevenson called Miss Swenson ''a dazzling technician and manifestly an intelligent and sympathetic woman.''         The idea of the 1979 volume was not so much to write poems but, in the words of the title, to describe ''things taking place.'' Miss Swenson concerned herself with the observations her eyes made, as in this line from a poem entitled ''Colors Without Objects'':  I wait for a few  iridium specks of idea to thrive  in the culture of my eye.         Reflecting poetically on the relationship between observation and intellect, vision and thought, Miss Swenson in 1963 closed a poem entitled ''Cabal'' this way:  Eye light and mind light,  lightning-taming leather  I will turn, and be  a swiftness on the dark.         Miss Swenson, who lived for the last two decades of her life with her companion, R. R. Knudson, in Sea Cliff, L.I., graduated from Utah State Agricultural College. She worked for a year on a Salt Lake City newspaper before coming to New York in the late 1930's. She worked for several years as a stenographer and then as an editor for New Directions, writing poems all the time.         With recognition came awards, including Rockefeller, Guggenheim, and Ford Foundation grants, the Brandeis University Creative Arts Award and, in 1981, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry from Yale University. Two years ago, she received a $130,000 Fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation.         Miss Swenson is survived by eight brothers and sisters, all of Utah.
