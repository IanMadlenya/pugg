         Maria St. Just, an actress and longtime friend of Tennessee Williams, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was in her late 60's or early 70's, her family said.         The cause was heart failure brought on by severe rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter Natasha Grenfell.         Lady St. Just was born in Petrograd but was taken by her mother to London when she was an infant. Her father, a doctor, remained in the Soviet Union and was later executed. She studied ballet as a young girl, but a leg operation when she was 14 put an end to her plans for a dancing career.         She won a scholarship to study at the Old Vic, after which she joined John Gielgud's company.         In 1948, before the company embarked on a foreign tour, she attended a party given by Mr. Gielgud in honor of Williams. A lifelong friendship with the playwright ensued. Lady St. Just was a co-executor of Williams's estate, and in 1990 she published "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982" (Alfred A. Knopf).         She appeared in the film "Room With a View" (1985) and in "Maurice" (1987), which was filmed at her estate near Salisbury.         In 1956 she married Peter Grenfell, the son of a British partner of J. P. Morgan. In 1973 Grenfell became a peer. He died in 1984.         In addition to her daughter Natasha, of London, she is survived by another daughter, Pulcheria, of Orleans, France, and two granddaughters.       
         Dr. Martha E. Rogers, a nursing administrator at New York University for 20 years who helped establish nursing as a profession with responsibilities apart from traditional medical care, died on Sunday at her home in Phoenix. She was 79.         She died of pulmonary failure complicated by emphysema, said her brother-in-law, J. Paul Coleman of Johnson City, Tenn.         In her book "An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing" (1970), Dr. Rogers drew on many disciplines, including psychology, sociology, biology, history and literature, to postulate a humanistic nursing science. She termed it "a unified concept of human functioning" basic to understanding and treating people. Treating the Whole Person         While physicians respond to the immediate medical condition of a patient, "nursing is concerned with evaluating the simultaneous state of the individual (or group) and the environment and the preceding configuration leading up to the present," she wrote.         While much of her work is considered complex if not abstract and the subject of scores of academic articles, her theories led to numerous studies evaluating patients beyond the traditional scope of medical treatment, such as determining the agitation of bed-ridden patients by observing arm and leg movements and the role of nursing in dealing with hyperactive children.         Dr. Rogers was a strong advocate of rebuilding nursing education programs by replacing the hospital training of nurses, where she received her early training, with university studies, which she was later to head at New York University from 1954 to 1975.         After taking science courses from 1931 to 1933 at the University of Tennessee, Dr. Rogers, who was born in Dallas, received a nursing diploma from the Knoxville General Hospital School of Nursing in Tennessee in 1936. She graduated from George Peabody College in Nashville in 1937.         In the mid-1940's, she established the first visiting nurse service in Arizona, one of the first in the nation. In 1945 she received a master's degree in nursing supervision from Teachers College of Columbia University and in 1952 she received a master's of public health and two years later a doctor of science, both from Johns Hopkins University.         Dr. Rogers's books, including "Nursing: A Science of Unitary Man" (1980) and "Science of Unitary Human Beings: A Paradigm for Nursing" (1983), are standard works for advanced nursing students.         She is survived by two sisters, Laura R. Wilhite of Knoxville and Jane R. Coleman of Johnson City, Tenn.       
         Mai Zetterling, the Swedish actress who went on to a career as one of Europe's busiest female film directors, died on Tuesday in London. She was 68 and had homes in London and in Banne, France.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, Joyce Edwards.         Ms. Zetterling was directing the film "The Woman Who Cleaned the World," which she had written, when she died.         Mai Elisabeth Zetterling was born in Vasteras, Sweden, to a working-class family. She left school barely literate, according to her 1985 autobiography, "All Those Tomorrows."         After working in a drug store and a mail-order company, she tried acting and was invited to join the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her stage and screen debuts when she was 17. Breakthrough in 'Torment'         Her sensitive portrayal of a simple girl victimized by a sadistic professor in "Torment" (released in the United States in 1947), created a sensation and is now considered a landmark of the Swedish cinema. The film, directed by Alf Sjoberg and written by Ingmar Bergman, was released under the title "Frenzy" in England and made her an international star.         She also appeared in "Frieda" (1947), "Desperate Moment" (1953), "Knock on Wood" with Danny Kaye (1954), "A Prize of Gold" with Richard Widmark (1955), "Abandon Ship!" with Tyrone Power (1957), "Only Two Can Play" with Peter Sellers (1961), "The Vine Bridge" (1965), "The Witches" (1990) and "Hidden Agenda" (1990).         In the 1960's and 1970's she was one of the few women who found regular work as a director. Her first effort, "The War Game" (1963), a short documentary, won a first prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Many of her subsequent films dealt explicitly with female sexuality and focused on the role of women in society.         Among her directorial credits are "Loving Couples" (1964), "Night Games" (1966), "Doctor Glas" (1968), "The Girls" (1969), "Vincent the Dutchman" (1975), "Lady Policeman" (1979), "Of Seals and Men" (1979) "Scrubbers" (1983) and "Amorosa" (1986).         In later years she continued acting, co-starring with Anjelica Huston in Nicholas Roeg's 1990 film "The Witches."         Ms. Zetterling also wrote children's books, short stories and novels, one of which, "Night Games," she adapted and directed for the screen.         Her two marriages, to Tutte Lemkow, a Norwegian dancer, and the novelist David Hughes, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son and a daughter from her first marriage.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Dr. Annemarie P. Weil, a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, died on Friday at a convalescent home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         She had had a long illness, said her daughter, Dr. Susan Caroline Weil.         Dr. Weil was in private practice in Manhattan, her daughter said, and at her death was also on the faculty of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Dr. Weil graduated from the institute in 1949 and joined its faculty in 1959. She was a supervising and training analyst there, as well as a teacher.         Dr. Ted E. Becker Sr., a former chairman of the institute's child analysis committee, said that Dr. Weil's "primary interest and research had to do with the neurological and organic aspects of child development."         She was born Annemarie Phiebig in Berlin and earned her Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Basel, Switzerland, in 1934. She and her husband, Dr. Frederic S. Weil, came to the United States from Switzerland in 1940 and settled in Manhattan.         Dr. Weil went on to be a junior psychiatrist on the staff of Bellevue Hospital, a senior psychiatrist at the Child Development Center and a member of the faculty of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. She wrote many papers in her field and received several awards.         Her husband, also a psychoanalyst, died in 1959 after 22 years of marriage.         In addition to her daughter, a hematologist in Wynnewood, Pa., Dr. Weil is survived by two grandsons and a brother, Albert Phiebig of White Plains.       
         Rita Webb Smith, a community advocate whose work to rid a neighborhood of drug trafficking gained her national attention, died last Saturday at her home in Harlem. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A lifelong resident of West 143d Street, Mrs. Smith was a social worker and counselor for many years at Harlem Hospital, the Children's Aid Society and, most recently, the Visiting Nurse Service.         Starting with the organization of a preservation group for her street, she helped the police in her precinct to clear a drug-infested neighborhood. Her preservation group was largely credited with the restoration of a 10-block area in Harlem between 138th and 144th Streets.         Her efforts received the attention of national television shows and she recounted her experiences in a book written with Tony Chapelle, "The Woman Who Took Back Her Street" (New Horizon, 1990). It describes her life and her efforts to keep drug dealers and addicts from dominating her surroundings. Making a Difference         Mrs. Smith founded her own agency, the Family Systems for Living Center, to provide individual counseling, classes, referrals and other social services. She also started M.A.N.A. -- Make A Neighborhood Again -- to keep up the restored area; and Project Living With AIDS, which provides counseling for AIDS patients.         Mrs. Smith graduated from Fordham University College at Lincoln Center and Fordham's Graduate School of Social Service. The university made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1984 for showing that "even one citizen can make a difference." Her work also drew praise from Mayor Koch and President Reagan.         She is survived by seven daughters and sons: Judy, David, Gladys, Peter, Abena and Ayana, all of Harlem, and Mark, a resident of Spring Valley, N.Y. Also surviving is a sister, Pearl Edwards, of St. John's, Antigua.       
         Merriam Modell, a writer of short stories and suspense novels, died on July 1 at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 86.         The cause was pulmonary embolism, the result of a recent accident, said her son, John.         Mrs. Modell, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym Evelyn Piper, created dozens of stories and novels, some of which were made into movies. Among them are "Bunny Lake Is Missing," with Laurence Olivier and Carol Lynley, and "The Nanny," which starred Bette Davis.         Mrs. Modell's first stories appeared in The New Yorker in the early 1940's, and several novels followed, among them "The Sound of Years" (1946) and "My Sister, My Bride" (1948). Many had a common theme: the domestic conflicts faced by American families.         Among her other works are "The Innocent" (1949), "The Motive" (1950), "The Plot" (1951) and "The Lady and Her Doctor" (1956).         She is survived by two grandchildren, in addition to her son.       
         Dr. Enid R. Peschel, a medical educator and researcher at Yale University, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Dr. Peschel, who lived in Woodbridge, Conn., was 51.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Richard E. Peschel.         Dr. Peschel was an adjunct assistant professor of internal medicine and co-director of the program for humanities in medicine at the School of Medicine at Yale. She graduated from Brown University and received a doctorate in French history from Harvard University.         She and her husband wrote "When a Doctor Hates a Patient and Other Chapters in a Young Physician's Life" (1986). She also was the author or co-editor of 10 other books.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Colette, also of Woodbridge, and a sister, Nola Royce of Delmar, N.Y.       
         Pearl Primus, a pioneering dancer, choreographer and teacher whose anthropological work exposed Americans to the realities of black life in America and to the richness of African and Caribbean dance, died on Saturday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 74.         Miss Primus died after a brief illness, said Joyce Knight, a friend.         A powerful performer and lecturer, Miss Primus played a role similar to that of Katherine Dunham in establishing dance by and about blacks as an important part of American culture. Her belief that there was material for dance in the everyday lives of black people -- and her strong personality and early success -- had a profound influence on several generations of black choreographers and dancers, among them Donald McKayle and Alvin Ailey.         Miss Primus visited Africa for the first time in 1948, but she had begun to present carefully researched dance with African themes in 1943 and was the first American choreographer to do so. In 1974, her contributions were celebrated in a salute to her and the ballerina Janet Collins by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         But Miss Primus was equally celebrated for her depiction of American life and of the injustices inflicted on black Americans, particularly in the American South. In one of her best-known dances, "Strange Fruit," a woman reacts in horror to a lynching. "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" -- created, like "Strange Fruit," in 1943 and inspired by the Langston Hughes poem -- depicted the Mississippi and the hard lives of blacks along its shores. "Dance has been my freedom and my world," she said in 1991. "I dance not to entertain but to help people better understand each other."         An accident of fate led Miss Primus to become a dancer. Born in Trinidad, she was brought to the United States as a child by her parents. She received a bachelor's degree in biology and pre-medical sciences from Hunter College with the intention of becoming a doctor. Unable to find a laboratory job open to blacks, she applied to the National Youth Administration and was put into a dance group.         She enrolled in modern-dance classes at the New Dance Group, where she began to teach, and in 1943 gave the first performance of her own work. John Martin wrote in The New York Times that "if ever a young dancer was entitled to a company of her own and the freedom to do what she chooses with it, she is it."         A few months later, Barney Josephson invited Miss Primus to perform at his Cafe Society Downtown. Troubled by having to choose between medicine and dance, she consulted Mr. Martin. No one would ever be able to say, he told her, whether art or medicine had the greater curative power. Miss Primus remained at the nightclub for 10 months. When there was a problem with the music during her first performance there, a burly man rose from the audience and encouraged her to keep on, teasing her about having broken up his home by teaching his son the Lindy Hop. The man was Paul Robeson, one of many black cultural figures with whom Miss Primus would become friendly over the years.         Miss Primus toured with the musical "Show Boat," then founded a company and presented her work on Broadway and in national tours. On one Southern tour, she was offered a Rosenwald Foundation scholarship to study dance in Africa. Later, she worked there with local performers. She married Percival Borde, a dancer she met on a visit home to Trinidad in 1953, and they founded a popular school in New York and performed frequently together. Mr. Borde died in 1979.         Miss Primus was made director of a new performing-arts center in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1959. Two years later, she and Mr. Borde performed throughout Africa with their dancers and musicians on a tour sponsored by the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. It was not until 1978 that she completed her work for a doctorate in anthropology at New York University.         "My life has been like traveling up a river," she told an interviewer in 1979. "Every now and then I would hear singing around the bend, and so around the bend I would go and become occupied with living."         Miss Primus continued to perform until 1980, after which she was the director of the Cora P. Maloney College, a black studies school at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and was Five-College Professor of Ethnic Studies at schools in Massachusetts in the 1980's. She was an early and important participant in "The Black Tradition in American Dance," a program to revive and preserve black dance that began in 1988 at the American Dance Festival, where in 1991 she was named the first recipient of the Balasaraswati/ Joy AnnDewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching. Other honors included the National Medal of the Arts in 1991. Miss Primus continued to teach throughout the United States until her death.         She is survived by a son, Onwin Borde of Miami.
