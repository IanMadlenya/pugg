         Andrea M. Bronfman, an internationally noted philanthropist, died on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan. She was 60 and had homes in Manhattan; Palm Beach, Fla.; and Jerusalem.         The police said that Mrs. Bronfman died of injuries she sustained after she was struck by a livery cab early Monday morning while walking her dog on East 65th Street.         The wife of Charles R. Bronfman, of the Seagram empire, Mrs. Bronfman was a co-chairman of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies. She was known in particular for her involvement with Jewish causes in the United States, Canada and Israel.         Mrs. Bronfman was also a founder of the Gift of New York, which through the spring of 2003 provided free tickets to cultural and sporting events to the families of Sept. 11 victims.         Andrea Brett Morrison, known as Andy, was born in London on May 30, 1945, the daughter of an American mother, Doris, and a Scottish father, Hyam, who ran a women's clothing business. Both were deeply involved in Jewish and Zionist affairs; frequent visitors to the family home included David Ben-Gurion, Shimon Peres and Golda Meir.         After working briefly as a secretary in London, Andrea married David Cohen, and moved with him to Canada. The marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Bronfman in 1982.         Mrs. Bronfman was a trustee of many organizations, among them the Jewish Museum and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. Her other work included founding the Association of Israel's Decorative Arts and creating a traveling exhibition, ''A Coat of Many Colours: Two Centuries of Jewish Life in Canada,'' which was shown in New York at the Jewish Museum in 1993.         Besides her husband, a retired co-chairman of the Seagram Company, Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a sister, Marcia Flanders, of Montreal; three children from her first marriage, Jeremy Cohen of Manhattan, Pippa Cohen of Manhattan and Tony Cohen of Toronto; two stepchildren, Stephen Bronfman of Montreal and Ellen Hauptman of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.       
         Sarah Caldwell, one of America's best known and most adventurous conductors and opera directors and the founding director of the Opera Company of Boston, died Thursday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. She was 82.         She died of heart failure, said James Morgan, a former manager of the Boston company and a close associate.         Ms. Caldwell, who was also the first woman to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera, lived in Freeport, Me.         In 1990, 32 years after its founding, facing debt and disarray, the Opera Company of Boston went out of business. But in its glory years, Ms. Caldwell's company was a model of bold, imaginative programming, offering musically insightful productions with distinguished casts.         ''Some of the most creative work that many of us artists have done has been with Sarah,'' Beverly Sills, the soprano and former chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera, said yesterday. ''Some of the most aggravating, as well. She had a million different ways to do one thing and was never satisfied until she had tried them all.''         Ms. Caldwell often took on difficult 20th-century operas that bigger companies shirked. Her productions included the American premieres of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace,'' Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' Roger Sessions's ''Montezuma,'' Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Taverner'' and Rodion Shchedrin's ''Dead Souls,'' as well as the world premieres of Gunther Schuller's ''Fisherman and His Wife'' and Robert Di Domenica's ''Balcony.''         Her company seldom presented more than four productions a season. But from the start, Ms. Caldwell attracted world-class artists, notably Ms. Sills and Dame Joan Sutherland. She was both director and conductor for most of her productions -- a double role that often imbued them with a strong vision. But her split duties just as often seemed to divide her attention, resulting in weakened execution onstage and in the orchestra pit.         Ms. Caldwell's longest period of success came in the 1970's, when the company was thriving and her visibility as a conductor was growing. In 1974, she became only the second woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic. (Nadia Boulanger had been the first in 1939 and again in 1962.) For the program, partly sponsored by Ms. magazine, Ms. Caldwell offered only works by women, among them Ruth Crawford Seeger, Lili Boulanger and Thea Musgrave.         A Time magazine cover story on Nov. 10, 1975, called her ''Music's Wonder Woman.'' Two months later, on Jan. 13, 1976, she became the first woman to conduct at the Met. The opera was ''La Traviata,'' starring Ms. Sills, who had cajoled the company into engaging Ms. Caldwell. She conducted 11 total performances.         As a company director, Ms. Caldwell was notoriously disorganized and loath to delegate authority. Only 5 feet 3 inches tall and, for most of her life, overweight, she was an indomitable but chaotic force. Rehearsal periods were typically fraught with crisis. Ms. Caldwell, sleepless and disheveled, would keep stage crews working all night and fight off creditors all day. Stories abounded of staff members' finding their boss napping in a stairwell or atop a pile of costumes backstage.         Yet, even on a shoestring budget, she managed to present challenging repertory in inventive productions. One, in 1965, was Rossini's ''Semiramide,'' a rarely performed work at the time, with Dame Joan and Marilyn Horne. Ms. Caldwell also staged the United States premiere of ''Boris Godunov'' with Mussorgsky's original orchestration nine years before the Metropolitan Opera did. And hers was the first complete American staging of Berlioz's ''Troyens.''         Ms. Caldwell faced formidable obstacles in running her company. Financial support from the Boston civic and cultural worlds was inconsistent, and the company lacked an adequate theater. The year her company began, 1958, the long-neglected 50-year-old Boston Opera House was torn down, and the new company was forced into a nomadic existence, performing at the Donnelly Theater (razed in 1968), then the downtown Shubert Theater and then a series of unlikely places, like a university gym and a South End cyclorama.         The company finally settled at the Orpheum Theater, staying for five years. But the stage was only 26 feet deep, and there was no orchestra pit. Ms. Caldwell's solution was to remove several rows of seats from the orchestra section to make room for her players. She conducted sitting in a director's chair, usually in slippers.         In 1978, the company bought the B. F. Keith Memorial Theater on Washington Street in downtown Boston, and it finally had a home -- a run-down but potentially excellent 2,500-seat theater with good acoustics and palatial lobbies. But the stage was just 35 feet deep, and the only way to expand would have been to claim a small street that bordered the back of the building, an idea that neighborhood residents and businesses opposed. A complete renovation would have cost only $13 million, Ms. Caldwell estimated. But by 1990, with back taxes looming, she sold the theater to a Texas developer, and her company essentially ceased to exist.         Sarah Caldwell was born on March 6, 1924, in Maryville, Mo. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. During her childhood, she and her brother frequently lived with relatives while her mother, Margaret, was off pursuing graduate studies in music. Ms. Caldwell began taking violin lessons early, and by 6 was giving concerts out of state. When her mother married Henry Alexander, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, the family moved to Fayetteville.         Discouraged by her stepfather from pursuing a career in music, Ms. Caldwell entered the University of Arkansas as a psychology major. Within a year she was a violin major at Hendrix College in Arkansas. She later earned a scholarship from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.         It was her summers in the Berkshires at the Tanglewood Music Institute that shifted her toward opera. There, in 1947, she staged Vaughan Williams's ''Riders to the Sea.'' Her idol, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, who directed the institute, was so impressed, he invited her to join the faculty the next year. During this period she became an assistant to the conductor Boris Goldovsky, who ran an opera program at the New England Conservatory. By 1952, Ms. Caldwell was running one herself, at Boston University, which she kept going for eight years.         She started her own company, initially called the Opera Group, in 1958 with just $5,000 in seed money. By 1965, renamed the Opera Company of Boston, it had won an important place in American opera. She tried to be everything: administrator, fund-raiser, proselytizer. But her assumption of both the director and conductor roles in her productions cost the company time and money. During rehearsals, the orchestra would often sit idly in the pit, collecting union-scale pay, while Ms. Caldwell dealt with a directorial detail onstage.         When everything came together, however, the productions had the kind of cohesiveness usually achievable only in festival conditions. There was, for example, a critically hailed production of Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini'' in 1975 with Jon Vickers in the title role; another vibrant production was of Verdi's ''Macbeth'' with Shirley Verrett, a frequent Caldwell collaborator who became Boston's favorite diva, as Lady Macbeth.         Ms. Caldwell was generally thought to be more gifted as a director. Her ideas were usually backed by enormous amounts of historical research. But her conducting, while technically idiosyncratic and often untidy, was musical and sensitive. And she was a pioneer of colorblind casting in opera.         Ms. Caldwell's constant search for financial support led her into a political quagmire in 1982. She agreed to develop an opera program in the Philippines, signing a contract with Imelda Marcos, the wife of the country's repressive president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. Ms. Caldwell insisted that the contract was with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, not the government. But in reality Mrs. Marcos was financing the center to help build her political power base. A year later, facing protests at home from human-rights groups and outraged company patrons, Ms. Caldwell pulled out of the deal.         In 1988, she organized an ambitious three-week festival called Making Music Together, which took 250 Soviet dancers, musicians, composers and other artists to Boston for some 80 events. The festival was budgeted at $2.4 million. But when corporate support and ticket sales did not meet expectations, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, with the intervention of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, bailed Ms. Caldwell out with more state support, averting a diplomatic embarrassment.         For many years Ms. Caldwell lived with her mother in Weston, a Boston suburb. She leaves no immediate survivors.         In 1999, Ms. Caldwell accepted a post as distinguished professor of music at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, but left within several years because of poor health. Missing New England, she moved to Freeport in 2003.         Ms. Caldwell never gave up hope that she could raise funds and re-start her company. It was not to be. But for a while, as the British critic Andrew Porter wrote in The New Yorker, she was ''the single best thing about opera in America.''       
         Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89.         She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.         In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities.         At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.         Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.         ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.         Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.         In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.         ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''         Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''         Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''         The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.         Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.         Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.         ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.         ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said.         Action, Not Just Words         Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.         In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape.         The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won.         Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.         She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.         ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.         After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.         But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.         What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.         Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.         A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.         But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.         On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.         In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.         In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.         Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.         In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.         ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''         Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.         ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''         Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.         Subways Lead to Jobs         Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.         She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.         She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.         While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.         Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.         Suspicions Aroused         In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.         ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.         ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''         Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.         ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''         William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.         ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''         The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.         Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''         ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''         Form Over Substance?         Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.         ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.         Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.         She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.         Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.         During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.         She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.         In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.         ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''       
         Muriel Spark, known for her finely polished, darkly comic prose and for the unforgettable Miss Jean Brodie, one of the funniest and most sinister characters in modern fiction, died Friday at a hospital in Florence, Italy. She was 88.         Ms. Spark's death was announced yesterday, The Associated Press reported, by Massimiliano Dindalini, the mayor of the Tuscan village of Civitella della Chiana, where she had lived for almost 30 years.         Her work, unlocked from her innermost memories of her experiences before and after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954, built a canon of short, sometimes macabre, sometimes humorous novels that sought to pare away the absurdities of human behavior.         Ms. Spark's first novel was published when she was 39, and after that she supplied a stream of slender novels and enigmatic short stories peopled with such curiosities as narrators from beyond the grave, flying saucers, grandmotherly smugglers with bread bins full of diamond-studded loaves and individuals of so little substance that they disappear when the door closes.         In her writing, evil is never far away, violence is a regular visitor and death is a constant companion. Her themes were generally serious but nearly always handled with a feather-light touch.         It is this lightness, and a contrived detachment toward her characters, that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work, which at her death included more than 20 novels, several collections of short stories, poetry, criticism, biography, plays and a handful of children's books.         Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent -- sometimes quite merrily -- to terrible deaths.         ''People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone,'' she said in an interview in The New Yorker. ''I'm often very deadpan, but there's a moral statement too, and what it's saying is that there's a life beyond this, and these events are not the most important things. They're not important in the long run.''         She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1, 1918, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland, and his wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell, a Protestant from a country village near London.         When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie's High School for Girls, where she became one of the crème de la crème of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay, the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1961), which was later adapted for the stage and film.         Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief, and as she had put it, ''disastrous,'' marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa.         He was known as S. O. S., a fitting nickname, it turned out, when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years. ''He became a borderline case, and I didn't like what I found on either side of the border,'' she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, ''Curriculum Vitae.''         They lived in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and their union produced her only child, a son, Robin.         She kept the name Spark, partly for her son's sake and partly because she thought it had ''some ingredient of life and of fun.''         She longed to return to Britain, but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel. She finally succeeded in returning aboard a troopship in 1944, leaving her son, then 6, in the care of convent nuns in Central Africa until the war was over.         Once home, she went to London in search of work, taking up residence at the Helena Club, which later became the model for the May of Teck Club, the setting for her 1963 novel, ''The Girls of Slender Means.''         Propaganda and Poetry         In London she landed a job with the Foreign Office in a secret division that disseminated black propaganda, a brand of disinformation she described as ''detailed truth with believable lies.'' The reports, broadcast on what masqueraded as a German radio station, used real names and addresses to lend veracity to invented stories, and the announcers were German prisoners of war. Although the fabricated news items were aimed at undermining the Nazis, there were times when they worked too well and surfaced as news in the British press.         After the war she worked at a jewelry trade publication, Argentor, in London, joined the Poetry Society and later became editor of its Poetry Review, a job that lasted for two tempestuous years before she was dismissed. Her innovations there included paying for worthy submissions and ending the practice of accepting payments from poets, a change that drastically altered the content of the review and outraged its establishment.         She founded a short-lived literary magazine, then went to work for a publishing house, devoting the remainder of her time to writing poetry, doing book reviews and writing and editing scholarly works, including the letters of John Henry Cardinal Newman.         Ms. Spark said she discovered through the writings of Cardinal Newman that the foundations of the Roman Catholic church corresponded with her personal convictions. She described her conversion to Catholicism as a natural step in her life. ''There was no blinding revelation in my case,'' she wrote in her autobiography.         Her first novel, ''The Comforters'' (1957), was born of religion and delusions. Newly converted and living in London in 1954, during the period of postwar food rationing, Ms. Spark ate little and chased away her hunger with Dexedrine, a combination that led to a period of hallucinations. The words she had once manipulated turned on her, trapping her in a fog of anagrams and crosswords and convincing her that a code ran through the literature she read.         After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Ms. Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, ''took the edge off cold charity.''         In ''The Comforters,'' a young woman recovering from a breakdown finds that she is a character in a novel that is being written on a phantom typewriter that only she can hear.         Religion is present in Ms. Spark's work in a variety of guises, from the unseen and unforgiving hand in ''Memento Mori'' (1959) to the hypocrisy of self-righteously pious characters like the couple in the short story ''The Black Madonna.'' Later in her life, the issue of her religious heritage became a persistent irritant.         She traced the seeds of ''Memento Mori,'' her third novel, to her childhood, when she learned about old age and human frailty at close range, caring for her dying grandmother. Although the novel is steeped in death and deception it is at times unabashedly hilarious. In the book, one elderly person after another in a close circle gets a mysterious phone call with a simple message: ''Remember, you must die.'' This slim novel about confronting mortality, packed with sex, blackmail and mystery, was adapted for the stage.         While Ms. Spark's books cover a broad territory of plot and character, some central similarities can be found in many of the novels and short stories.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review of Ms. Spark's novel ''Reality and Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1997, described the author's approach as a recipe: ''Take a self-enclosed community (of writers, schoolgirls, nuns, rich people, etc.) that is full of incestuous liaisons and fraternal intrigue; toss in a bombshell (like murder, suicide or betrayal) that will ricochet dangerously around this little world; and add some allusions to the supernatural to ground these melodramatics in an old-fashioned context of good and evil. Serve up with crisp, authoritative prose and present with 'a light and heartless hand.' ''         Delving Into School Secrets         This recipe appears with variations in novels including ''The Ballad of Peckham Rye'' (1960) , in which a truly devilish young man who calls himself an industrial analyst insinuates himself into the life of a community and goes about creating suspicion among neighbors, delving into personal secrets and destroying lives.         It reappears in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which provides a memorable example of a small and controlled community -- a girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930's -- in which the imperious teacher molds lives in a way few educators can.         ''Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she will be mine for life,'' intones the elegant Miss Brodie, who does not care whether her charges know their history or arithmetic as long as they have an appreciation of the finer things: art, Mussolini, proper care of the complexion, Franco.         She captivates her students and enriches their lives while exerting unnatural control, grooming them to serve her will, whether in the bed of one of her lovers, as her personal spy or as a martyr to one of her political causes. Her single-mindedness in devoting her ''prime'' to her students has consequences for every life she touches, from the men who love her to the student who is the author of her undoing.         Jay Presson Allen's adaptation for the stage became a vehicle in London in 1964 for Vanessa Redgrave, on Broadway in 1968 for Zoe Caldwell, who won a Tony for her performance, and in Hollywood in 1969 for Maggie Smith, who won an Oscar for best actress in the role.         No other book by Ms. Spark has received the widespread popular acclaim and exposure of ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' but in subsequent interviews, the author expressed a firm preference for dwelling on the future rather than the past.         In 1965 she published ''The Mandelbaum Gate,'' a heftier book and one that seems overstuffed by her standards. Set in Jerusalem against the backdrop of the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, ''The Mandelbaum Gate'' tackles questions of religion, memory and history superimposed on a torturous plot. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial prize.         In ''The Driver's Seat,'' published in 1970, a woman embarks on a wild search through Europe for the man who will kill her. With ''Hothouse on the East River'' in 1973, she moved the locale to New York, and the next year she responded to the Watergate scandal with ''The Abbess of Crewe,'' her own tale of burglars and stolen secrets set in yet another type of institution -- a convent. ''The Only Problem,'' in 1984, returns to the book of Job for inspiration.         Divine retribution of a sort neatly ties up her book ''Aiding and Abetting'' (2000), a fictional tale of a real man, Lord Lucan, known as Lucky, who killed his children's nanny, whom he apparently mistook for his wife in the dark, severely battered his wife, then disappeared, with the help of his friends. In the novel, two men claim to be the aging Lord Lucan, and both present themselves to a very high-priced Paris therapist who is fleeing her own past -- that of a fraudulent stigmatic.         Her last book, ''The Finishing School'' (2004), revisits the themes of boarding schools and envy.         Ms. Spark was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1967, became a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and in 1997 won the David Cohen Literature Prize for lifetime achievement.         She took issue, however, with the label ''British writer.'' She told one interviewer, ''I am Scottish by formation.'' She pointed out repeatedly that the bulk of her life had been spent in other countries. After London, she lived briefly in New York in the 1960's, then abandoned the crush of the literary world for Rome, where she had a rich social life and entertained lavishly.         Alliance and Estrangement         In Rome, she met the painter and sculptor Penelope Jardine, who became her secretary and later her companion. The two women traveled together, lived together, and over the years their lives grew deeply intertwined.         Interviewers repeatedly asked about the nature of the relationship of the two women who spent so many years together. Ms. Spark brushed aside the idea that their involvement was romantic; it was characterized as an ''old-fashioned friendship.''         Ms. Jardine purchased a sprawling medieval church compound in Tuscany, and they ultimately settled there. There Ms. Spark settled into her routine of writing in her favorite composition books, in longhand, using only pens untouched by other human hands, and rarely rewriting or revising what flowed from those pens. Ms. Jardine handled the business of everyday life, down to the typing of Ms. Spark's work.         When asked in an interview what she contributed to the household, Ms. Spark said she made her own bed, took morning tea to Ms. Jardine and took her out to meals. ''I think I pull my weight somehow or other,'' she said.         She saw her craft, she said in a 2004 interview, as driven by inspiration from an ''outside force'' unlocking memory in a manner derived from her reading of Marcel Proust.         ''It inspired me more than anything,'' she said at the time. ''I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found I rather liked writing prose.''         In her later years it became clear that she and her son, Robin, a painter who lives in Edinburgh, were irreconcilably estranged over various issues, including what he referred to as her abandonment of him, as well as her opinions about his ability as an artist and his public statements about their heritage.         Ms. Spark was harsh in her public criticism of his work and open about their estrangement. She told a newspaper: ''He can't sell his lousy paintings, and I have had a lot of success. He keeps sending them to me and I don't know what to do with them. I can't put them on my wall. He's never done anything for me, except for being one big bore.''         Their public feud extended to their religions and spilled into letters to newspapers and became a part of Ms. Spark's literary history when she donated letters from her son to the National Library of Scotland. Mr. Spark, who embraced Judaism about the same time his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, insisted that her mother had been Jewish, which by matrilineal inheritance would make him Jewish by birth; Ms. Spark, who considered herself only half-Jewish, maintained that though her father was Jewish, her mother was not.         Critics have disagreed on how to classify her work, which is alternately bleak and side-splitting. John Updike spoke of ''fun-house plots, full of trapdoors, abrupt apparitions and smartly clicking secret panels.'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called her a ''profoundly serious comic writer whose wit advances, never undermines or diminishes, her ideas.''         Taking the opposite view, Robert Maurer questioned the emotional underpinnings of her fiction, writing, ''One wonders how vast a reserve of sympathy lies beneath the iceberg of her consciousness, and how far beyond trickery her work would go if she let it show through.''         Ms. Spark said in several interviews that she would rather not fit neatly into any literary category. ''I have a comic strain, but my novels are serious,'' she said in 1993. ''Sometimes one makes one's own category, you know.''         Correction:  July 18, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary on April 16 about the novelist Muriel Spark misstated the date of her death. It was April 13, not April 14. The error was pointed out by a reader last week; the correction was further delayed for research.       
         Ellen Kuzwayo, the lone woman and the least flashy of the founders of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and a quiet moral force throughout the rise of the African National Congress from outlaw movement to governing party, died Wednesday in Johannesburg. She was 91.         The cause was complications of diabetes, her son Bobo told The South African Press Association.         Along with playing a role in fighting white oppression, Ms. Kuzwayo was also an early leader of the struggle of African women for equality with their men.         Her 1985 autobiography, ''Call Me Woman,'' described her beatings by her first husband and her loss of their children to him when they separated, because by law and tradition she was a minor. With it, she became the first black writer to win South Africa's premier literary prize, the CNA Award.         After Nelson Mandela's inauguration as president in 1994, she became, at the age of 79, a member of the first multiracial Parliament and served for five years.         At her death, Ms. Kuzwayo still lived in Soweto, the vast, isolated satellite city of tiny tract homes and jammed squatter camps a few miles from Johannesburg, a product of the determination of South Africa's white rulers to eject from their midst all blacks not employed as their domestic servants.         After the 1976 Soweto riots, set off by police shootings of schoolchildren protesting the forced change to the Afrikaans language in class, Ms. Kuzwayo became the lone woman on the Committee of 10, which informally governed the township when residents resisted paying rent to the despised Urban Bantu Council, appointed by the white government.         As a result, she was imprisoned without charge for five months in 1977.         In her 1996 testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated apartheid-era crimes, she described her predawn arrest, hiding in the bathroom trying to bathe and dress as police horses trampled her yard, and instructing Bobo, then a teenager, to keep a sharp eye out so that the police did not plant evidence as they searched.         She later helped establish the Urban Foundation, which pressed the government to let blacks own their houses, and she was a longtime adviser of the Zamani Soweto Sisters Council, the umbrella body for women's self-help groups; the first president of the Black Consumer Union; and the general secretary of the Y.W.C.A.         Ms. Kuzwayo, whose name before her marriage was Nnoseng Ellen Serasengwe, was born June 29, 1914, in the Orange Free State, an Afrikaner-dominated farming region, into a family of ministers and teachers; her maternal grandfather graduated from a missionary college in 1879 and had been the headmaster of a multiracial boys school and a court interpreter.         At 22, she began attending local African National Congress conferences with her father.         She later inherited the 6,000-acre farm owned by her mother's family, but lost it in the 1970's when the area was rezoned for white ownership only.         In the 1940's, she joined Mr. Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and others in forming the breakaway African National Congress Youth League, a more militant offshoot of the Congress, and served as its secretary. Mr. Mandela later formed its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation. He was convicted in 1964 on charges of treason and sabotage and imprisoned until 1990.         She became a teacher in 1938, but quit the profession in 1952 when the Native Education laws were supplanted by the Bantu Education Act, and missionary schools were closed.         ''I did not have the strength nor the courage to teach the children of my community what appeared to be very poisonous to their minds,'' she said later. ''The National Party gave them an inferior education so those children were going to remain the slaves of white people.''         She became a social worker, eventually becoming a revered figure in Soweto, known as Ma K, giving advice to women's groups, churches and schools and earning a salary from the social work department of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.         Besides her son Bobo, she is survived by another son, Justice; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         One of her most common laments was the lasting damage that apartheid and the violent fight against it had done to South Africa's children. The film ''Tsotsi,'' which won an Oscar as best foreign film this year, vividly shows the lives of young thugs on the Soweto-Johannesburg trains, and in 1996, Ms. Kuzwayo described to the truth commission the changes she had seen in young men like them.         In her early days as a social worker, she said, ''Sometimes after sunset I would be going through Orlando Station to go to my home, and it would be dark, and if I saw a group of young men standing there, I just ordered them to take me home.''         ''They would be grousing that they should be doing something else rather than taking this old lady home, but they obeyed. Believe you me, today I cannot do that, because I don't trust the very children who ought to protect me because of the handling of the government of South Africa of those days. They turned our children into animals.''         She herself was in a famous film about crime and injustice in South Africa, the 1951 version of ''Cry, the Beloved Country,'' starring Sidney Poitier. She had a small role as a shebeen queen -- the owner of an illegal Soweto tavern.       
         Elizabeth A. Connelly, a New York State assemblywoman from Staten Island for 27 years who was a leader in the fight against drunken driving, died yesterday at her home in the Westerleigh section of the borough. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Robert, said.         Mrs. Connelly, who retired in 2000, was the Assembly's chief sponsor of the 1982 law that raised the state's legal drinking age from 18 to 19; it has since been raised to 21. She was also a co-author of the law requiring judges to suspend the driver's license of anyone convicted of drunken driving.         When she retired, she was the speaker pro tempore of the Assembly, the highest rank a woman had ever reached there, and regularly presided over contentious debates.         Sometimes describing herself as a conservative Democrat, Mrs. Connelly sponsored legislation in the 1980's that would have ended state Medicaid financing for abortions. The measure failed.         Born Elizabeth Ann Keresey on June 19, 1928, Mrs. Connelly was a Brooklyn native whose family moved to the Bronx when she was 2. She did not attend college. In the mid-1940's, she worked as a secretary at the New York Life Insurance Company. Then, from 1946 to 1954, she worked in telephone sales for cargo at Pan American World Airways, with her future husband as her boss.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Connelly is survived by a son, Robert Jr. of Las Vegas; three daughters, Alice Lanzi of Staten Island, Margaret Nicholson of Katonah, N.Y., and Therese Shannon of Goshen, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.         The Connellys moved to Staten Island in 1954, and Mrs. Connelly became active in local politics, joining the North Shore Democratic Club of Richmond County. She was first elected to the Assembly in 1973 and was re-elected 13 times.         In 1977, Mrs. Connelly was appointed chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Developmental Disabilities, Alcoholism and Substance Abuse.         ''A family member suffered from mental illness,'' her husband said yesterday, ''and that's why she dedicated herself to that cause.''         Mrs. Connelly was also a co-sponsor of a 1994 bill calling for the secession of Staten Island from New York City. The effort stalled after the Assembly's Democratic leadership said they believed the State Constitution required that such a measure be requested by the city, not one of its boroughs.       
         Carolyn Shaw Bell, an economist at Wellesley College who took her fight for equal opportunities for women in economics from the college into the national arena, died May 13 at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 85.         Mary Ann Hill, a college spokeswoman, announced Dr. Bell's death.         Dr. Bell started her work at Wellesley in 1950. By 1995, an article in The New York Times pointed to the ''Wellesley effect,'' a disproportionately large number of graduates of Wellesley, a women's college, in executive suites and corporate boardrooms. It said the college's alumnae had long been overrepresented at Harvard Business School and said part of the reason was the dynamic teaching of Dr. Bell.         Dr. Bell carried her equality campaign to the American Economic Association, where she was a founder of the group's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. In 1998, the committee established the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award for the person who has most advanced women in the profession.         Her own scholarship focused on human capital, income distribution and the quality of economic data. She wrote two books, ''Consumer Choice in the American Economy'' (1967) and ''The Economics of the Ghetto'' (1970).         In 1973, she was appointed an overseer of the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College, the first woman appointed to any governing board there.         She advised the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter and was rumored to be in consideration for a high economic post in his administration that never materialized.         She deeply influenced distinguished students like Alicia Munnell, an assistant secretary of the treasury and member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration and now a professor at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College. Professor Munnell recounted last week how Dr. Bell's help continued through correspondence and networking for many years after graduation.         ''It was just to make sure that the students she came into contact with knew they could do anything they wanted to, and that she was behind them pushing and applauding all the way,'' Professor Munnell said.         Dr. Bell coined the term ''FEMS,'' for female economics majors, to describe her students and former students. Carolyn Shaw was born on June 21, 1920, in Framingham, Mass. She majored in economics at Mount Holyoke College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated magna cum laude.         She then worked at the Office of Price Administration, which was established during World War II to prevent inflation and was led by John Kenneth Galbraith, who later helped Dr. Bell create the committee of female economists. In 1949, she earned a doctorate at the London School of Economics.         At her retirement in 1989, she held the Katharine Coman chair in economics at Wellesley and had been departmental chairwoman twice.         Dr. Bell had moved to Arlington after living for many years in Lexington, Mass., and, previously, in Dover, Mass.         Her husband, Nelson Sibly Bell, died in 1991. She is survived by her daughter, Tova Maria Solo of Arlington, and one grandson.       
         Sister Rose Thering, a Roman Catholic nun and a former professor at Seton Hall University who battled anti-Semitism within her church and contributed to a historic Vatican declaration that Jews were not collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, died on Saturday at a convent in Racine, Wis. She was 85.         The cause was kidney failure, said Catherine Memory, a university spokeswoman. She said Sister Rose died at the Siena Center of the Sisters of St. Dominic, where she entered religious life in 1936 and had lived since retiring last year as professor emerita of education at Seton Hall, in South Orange, N.J.         Sister Rose -- who wore a Star of David fused to the cross on her neck, used words like ''chutzpah,'' and closed her letters with ''shalom'' -- devoted most of her adult life to writing, lecturing and traveling the world in a quest to promote greater understanding in the often-strained relationships between Christians and Jews.         As a member of a commission appointed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean, she helped write a 1994 law mandating the teaching of the Holocaust and genocide in all elementary and high schools in New Jersey. At Seton Hall, where she joined the faculty in 1968, she established workshops on Judaism for church leaders and teachers and led student groups on 54 tours of Israel.         In 2004, ''Sister Rose's Passion,'' a 39-minute documentary film on her life, won an award at the Tribeca Film Festival, and it was nominated for an Academy Award in 2005. She also received more than 80 humanitarian awards, including the Anti-Defamation League's Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award in 2004, the first to go to a woman.         ''The death of Sister Rose Thering is an immense loss for the entire Seton Hall family, indeed for all men and women who seek to forge a world of greater understanding,'' said Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the president of Seton Hall. ''For a half-century, she was an uncommon, inspired voice of reconciliation and dialogue among Christians and Jews.''         On a Wisconsin farm in childhood where Jews were spoken of in whispers, in her parochial school catechisms and other religious texts that portrayed Jews as Christ-killers, Rose Thering learned the coded messages of intolerance early in life and found them unsettling. Later, as a teacher, she examined the Catholic textbooks of her students more critically and was shocked by what she found.         ''I had ordered the most widely used Catholic religious teaching material from high school and grade school,'' she recalled in 2004. ''When I began to read, it almost made me ill.'' She cited a passage that asked, ''Why did the Jews commit the great sin of putting God himself to death?'' and another declaring, ''The worst deed of the Jewish people was the murder of the Messiah.''         She was in her 30's and had been teaching for years when she resolved to act against what she saw as a fundamental flaw in church teaching. The result was a study of anti-Semitism in Catholic texts and a dissertation for her 1961 doctorate at St. Louis University that propounded the evidence: textbooks and preachings that abounded in calumnies against Jews and Judaism. Her work was published later in an anthology, ''Faith and Prejudice'' (Paulist Press).         In 1962, when Pope John XXIII convened the ecumenical council known as Vatican II, Cardinal Augustin Bea used Sister Rose's study to draft portions of the 1965 Vatican document ''Nostra Aetate,'' (''In Our Age''), which reversed church policy and declared of Christ's death that ''what happened in his passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today,'' and, as for teaching, added: ''The Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God.''         ''They were 15 lines in Latin,'' Sister Rose recalled later, ''but they changed everything.''         In Catholic texts, in sermons, and in other pronouncements of the church, a new attitude toward Jews was officially adopted, and while centuries-old wounds remained, dialogues between the church and Israel and between Catholics and Jews have been elevated to a more respectful plane over time.         Sister Rose became an activist-teacher. She was hired at Seton Hall by Msgr. John Oesterreicher, an Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis in 1938. He converted to Catholicism, became a priest and in 1953 founded the Institute of Judeo-Christian Studies at Seton Hall, a groundbreaking program that included priests, nuns and rabbis on the faculty and offered seminars for clergy, teachers and others.         In 1974, Sister Rose presented a menorah to Pope Paul VI at the Vatican. In 1986, she went to Austria to protest the inauguration of President Kurt Waldheim, the former United Nations secretary general, who had served in a Nazi army unit implicated in the deportation of Jews from Greece in World War II. In 1987, she went to the Soviet Union to protest the government's treatment of Russian Jews.         Rose Elizabeth Thering was born on Aug. 9, 1920, in Plain, Wis., the sixth of 11 children in a German-American farm family that prayed together daily. She joined the Sisters of St. Dominic at 16, and earned a bachelor's degree from the Dominican College in Racine in 1953, a master's degree from the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul in 1957 and a doctorate at St. Louis University four years later.         In recognition of her interfaith work, the Rose Thering Endowment for Jewish-Christian Studies was established at Seton Hall in 1992; it has given scholarships to 350 teachers for graduate studies on the Holocaust and other subjects.         She is survived by two brothers, Raymond Thering, of Reedsburg, Wis., and Dr. H. R. Thering, of El Paso, Tex.; and four sisters, Lucille Neuheisel, of Sauk City, Wis., Imelda Misslish, of Prairie du Sac, Wis., Bernice Leigel, of Muscoda, Wis., and Mary Phillips, of Middleton, Wis.       
         Evelyn Dubrow, organized labor's most prominent lobbyist at the time of its greatest power in her four decades with the nation's largest apparel union, died on Tuesday in Washington. Family members said she was 95.         She died at George Washington Hospital after several days in a coma, said Jay Mazur, former president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, now part of Unite Here.         Just 4 feet 11 inches tall and famed for working 15-hour days, Ms. Dubrow was one of the most colorful and respected lobbyists in Washington, and one of the first powerful women among them. One fellow lobbyist called her ''the little engine that could.''         Sometimes she visited 30 senators in a day. She said she trudged so many miles around Capitol Hill that she wore out 24 pairs of her Size 4 shoes each year.         David Dubinsky, the legendary president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, named Ms. Dubrow the union's chief Washington lobbyist in 1956, once saying that she was the girl who should represent all the girls in the union.         Tireless and an eloquent speaker, she was a powerful voice for labor and for social legislation, including Medicare, school spending and civil rights.         At a signing ceremony in 1965 for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, President Lyndon B. Johnson singled out Ms. Dubrow, saying she deserved credit for pushing through the legislation.         Although he was just as conservative as Ms. Dubrow was liberal, Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate in 1964, was friendly with Ms. Dubrow, once telling Mr. Dubinsky, ''That's a smart little girl lawyer you've got down here.'' She was not a lawyer, however.         She was so well liked and such a fixture on Capitol Hill that House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. assigned her a chair among the Congressional doorkeepers' chairs outside the House of Representatives so she would not have to stand all day while waiting to buttonhole arriving or departing House members. She was the only lobbyist to have such a seat.         ''Lobbyists tend to work for, or even become, fat cats,'' Ms. Dubrow said in a 1997 interview with Washingtonian Magazine. ''Well, I'm not. And I don't. I work for more than 350,000 union members and 250,000 retirees. They're far from fat cats. They're hard-working citizens who can't trot up to Capitol Hill and meet their representatives directly.''         She worked in Washington under presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower through Bill Clinton. She won many battles, like raising the federal minimum wage to $1.15 an hour in 1961. But she often lost, failing, for example, to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement under Mr. Clinton.         When Mr. Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999 -- he towered over her as they hugged -- he said, ''A tenacious and effective union activist, she has been a force for social justice and improved labor conditions by working for increases in the minimum wage, health care reform, family and medical leave, and pay equity for women.''         In Ms. Dubrow's early years as a lobbyist, some senators asked her to baby-sit, among them the fathers of Al Gore, the former vice president, and Christopher J. Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut.         She did not hide her disappointment that Republicans took control of Congress in the 1990's.         ''What most bothers me in this Republican Congress is how they make it seem a crime for anyone to be poor -- like the poor want to be poor,'' she said in a Washingtonian interview. ''Some of those folks on the Hill can't get it through their thick heads that as representatives in a democracy, they should care about the people who most need their help.''         Evelyn Dubrow -- known universally as Evy -- was born in Passaic, N.J., on March 6, 1911, relatives said; she left no immediate survivors. She graduated from New York University in the 1930's, having studied journalism there; she sometimes fudged dates to hide her age. She worked as a reporter for The Morning Call of Paterson, N.J.         Ms. Dubrow became secretary for the Textile Workers Union in New Jersey in the late 1930's and then assistant to the president of the state's C.I.O. council.         She said it was no surprise that she became active in labor and politics because her father, a carpenter, was a union man and Socialist émigré from Belarus while an older sister was once arrested in a suffragists' protest in front of the White House.         In 1948, she became New York State director for Americans for Democratic Action. She twice campaigned for Adlai E. Stevenson, who lost twice to Eisenhower, and afterward she became the garment workers' Washington lobbyist.         She attributed her lobbying success to what she called her BAT theory: ''I don't beg,'' she said. ''I don't assume I know all the answers, and I don't threaten.'' She explained that if lawmakers voted against labor's position, it was unwise to grow angry or threaten to defeat them because then they might never support labor again on any issue.         ''I've always told people, you need better feet than brains to lobby,'' she told Women's Wear Daily in 1988, adding that a sense of humor, a smile and a nonthreatening manner helped, too.         ''I have a theory,'' she added. ''I don't wear pants. Some men don't like women in pants.''       
         Reathel Odum, a bank clerk who was chosen by Senator Harry S. Truman during the Depression to be one of his secretaries and later served in the White House as personal secretary to Bess Truman, died in her hometown, Benton, Ill., on June 6. She was 97.         Miss Odum's nephew, Richard Odum Hart, said news of her death was not released for several weeks.         In 17 years with the Trumans -- including two years chaperoning their daughter, Margaret, when she was making national tours as an aspiring classical singer -- Miss Odum became close to the family.         ''People have urged me to write a book and I said no,'' she said in a 1988 oral history for the Truman Presidential Museum and Library in Independence, Mo. ''I don't know anything that would be tantalizing or gossipy.''         If it does not offer significant historical observations, Miss Odum's oral history does provide interesting glimpses of Truman and his family, for example, how much he missed Mrs. Truman when she went home to Independence in the summer.         ''He'd put his head in the office door and say, 'Is there any mail from the Boss? If there isn't, I'm going to fire every one of you,' '' Miss Odum recalled. ''That was a standing joke.''         While Truman had a reputation for spicy language, Miss Odum said: ''He never did swear in front of us girls. He put women on a pedestal.''         Asked about Mrs. Truman's role as first lady, Miss Odum said, ''After meeting so many people and shaking their hands at receptions, she would go to her room and soak her hand in paraffin.''         Born on Sept. 29, 1908, Miss Odum was the youngest of five children. Her father died when she was 4, and her mother raised the family. Miss Odum, who never married, has no immediate survivors.         She graduated from Benton Township High School in 1926 and soon got a job at a local bank. One day 10 years later, Truman walked into a bank in St. Louis where Miss Odum was working and told its president, a friend, that he needed a secretary. The bank president recommended Miss Odum. ''I was scared to death,'' she recalled. ''I had never talked to a senator before.''         Miss Odum arrived at Truman's Senate office in Washington in October 1936 and worked there until 1945. She and Mrs. Truman volunteered together at the local U.S.O. during World War II. ''We peeled carrots and did whatever to help entertain soldiers away from home,'' Miss Odum said. Often, they took bike rides around the Tidal Basin.         Truman became vice president in 1945; less than three months later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was dead. On his first full day as president, Truman asked Miss Odum to be Mrs. Truman's personal secretary.         Unlike Eleanor Roosevelt, Mrs. Truman did not like to speak to reporters. Sometimes a ''press girl'' would call and ask what Mrs. Truman would be wearing to a reception, Miss Odum said, and the first lady would say, ''It's none of their business.''         In 1947, Miss Odum began accompanying Margaret Truman on her concert tours. Asked how Miss Truman reacted to music critics, Miss Odum said: ''She tried not to read the reviews. She had determination to go ahead despite the critics.''         After her White House service, which ended when Truman left office in 1953, Miss Odum worked as a secretary for Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri, for a coal industry lobbying group and then for the Truman Scholarship Foundation.         Whenever the Trumans returned to Washington, she said, ''I'd go over to the Mayflower and say hello.''         Correction:  August 9, 2006, Wednesday  A picture on July 24 with an obituary of Reathel Odum, secretary to Bess Truman when she was first lady, was published in error. The photograph, released by The Associated Press in 1945 and identified as Miss Odum, was actually Jane Lingo (a friend of President Truman's daughter, Margaret).       
         Cora T. Walker, a prominent New York lawyer who nearly 60 years ago became one of the first black women to practice law in the state, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, said her son Lawrence R. Bailey Jr., a lawyer, who practiced with his mother for many years.         For decades, Ms. Walker ran a private practice in Harlem, first on 125th Street and later from a restored brownstone at 270 Lenox Avenue. From 1976 until her retirement in 1999, she was the senior partner in Walker & Bailey, one of the city's few black law firms, which she established with her son.         The firm's practice eventually included corporate clients like Conrail, the Ford Motor Company, Texas Instruments and Kentucky Fried Chicken. But Ms. Walker continued drawing up wills and preparing personal-injury claims for the men and women she described as the ''plain, ordinary, not elegant people'' of her Harlem community.         Active in Republican politics, Ms. Walker ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Senate in 1958 and 1964. In 1970, The New York Times included her -- the only woman -- on a list of the most powerful leaders in Harlem.         Cora Thomasina Walker was born on June 20, 1922, in Charlotte, N.C., one of nine children of William and Benetta Jones Walker. The family moved to the Bronx when she was a child. When she was an adolescent, her parents separated, leaving her, her mother and her siblings dependent on public assistance.         After graduating from James Monroe High School in the Bronx, Ms. Walker promptly informed the Welfare Department that their help was no longer required: she would support the family. She took a night job as a teletype operator with Western Union and also sold Christmas cards.         At the same time, Ms. Walker was enrolled at St. John's University, then in Brooklyn, in a special six-year program in which students earned both a bachelor's degree and a law degree. She received a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. John's in 1945 and a law degree the next year.         For much of her career, Ms. Walker was active in the National Bar Association, a historically black organization. She helped found the association's Corporate Counsel Conference, an annual meeting sponsored by its commercial law section. Begun in 1988, the conference helps black lawyers cultivate relationships with corporate clients.         In the 1960's, Ms. Walker became the first woman to serve as president of the Harlem Lawyers Association.         Ms. Walker's marriage, to Lawrence R. Bailey Sr., a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to her son Lawrence Jr., of the Bronx, she is survived by another son, Bruce E. Bailey, a physician, of Norwich, Conn.; a sister, Danetta Black, formerly of White Plains; and three grandchildren.         In 1947, when Ms. Walker was admitted to the New York bar, she found the doors of the city's law firms tightly shut. (One firm relented and offered her a position -- as a secretary.) So she struck out on her own.         Her first client was an undertaker, for whom she did collections. Before long, by dint of reading self-improvement books, Ms. Walker had learned to ''join everything, give everybody a card, join a political club,'' as she told The New York Times in 1989.         In 1999, the New York County Lawyers' Association installed a plaque outside the Lenox Avenue brownstone where Ms. Walker had her office, commemorating her half-century in the law. The building has since been sold, her son said, and the plaque is now gone.       
         Alice Stone Ilchman, an economist and political scientist who was president of Sarah Lawrence College for nearly 20 years, died on Friday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said Judith Schwartzstein, a spokeswoman for the college, which is in Bronxville.         The eighth president of Sarah Lawrence, Ms. Ilchman (pronounced ILTSCH-man) was also its longest serving, holding the post from 1981 until 1998. She was previously an assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in the administration of President Jimmy Carter.         At her death, Ms. Ilchman was the director of the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship of the Thomas J. Watson Foundation. From 1995 to 2000, she was chairwoman of the Rockefeller Foundation.         Alice Stone was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1935. Her father, Donald Crawford Stone, was an educator and federal planner in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. She earned a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke in 1957; a master's from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1958; and a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics in 1965. She married Warren F. Ilchman in 1960.         After earning her doctorate, Ms. Ilchman directed the Peace Corps training program for India and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. She later taught economics at Wellesley, where she was Dean of the College         During Ms. Ilchman's tenure at Sarah Lawrence, the college's endowment grew from $3 million to $30 million. She oversaw the construction of two new buildings, including a science center, which was named for her this May.         Besides her husband, a former president of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn who is now the director of the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, Ms. Ilchman is survived by a son, Frederick, of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Hollinger of New York; two sisters, Nancy Dickinson of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Stone of Los Angeles; and a brother, Donald C. Stone Jr. of Oakland, Calif.       
         Oriana Fallaci, a dissecting interviewer of the powerful and an iconoclastic journalist who became an icon herself, died Friday in her home city of Florence, Italy. She was 77.         Ms. Fallaci, who also had a home in Manhattan, was known to have suffered from cancer for the last decade. Paolo Klun, an official with the RCS publishing group, which carried Ms. Fallaci's work, told The Associated Press that Ms. Fallaci had gone back to Florence days ago as her condition worsened and that she had died at a private hospital there.         Known in recent years for writing angrily against Islam, Ms. Fallaci became famous in the 1960's and 70's for her war journalism and her long, aggressive and revealing interviews with prominent people. She was once described in The Los Angeles Times as ''the journalist to whom virtually no world figure would say no.'' Among her subjects were Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of the Iranian revolution; Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader; Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister; Indira Gandhi, the longstanding Indian prime minister; Nguyen Van Thieu, the South Vietnamese president during the war years; and Henry Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon's secretary of state.         Mr. Kissinger called his experience with Ms. Fallaci ''the most disastrous conversation I ever had with any member of the press.'' At the height of his power and celebrity in 1972, she had coaxed him to admit that at times he felt like ''the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse, the cowboy who rides all alone into the town.'' Mr. Kissinger later wrote in his memoirs that the quotation harmed his relations with Nixon.         A glamorous figure with high cheekbones, a black curl of eyeliner and an ever-present cigarette, she believed that she had the right to ask or say anything, and did so in writings translated into more than 20 languages. In interviews she could be in turn incisive, flattering and blunt, taking her subjects by surprise.         ''How do you swim in a chador?'' she asked Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, not long after he came to power in Iran. His reply, she wrote in The New York Times, was that she was not obliged to wear one, because it was a garment for proper Islamic women. She tore off her chador, and Ayatollah Khomeini stalked off.         Her boldness earned her a new generation of admirers -- and many detractors -- after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, prompted her to end years of silence with warnings about Islam. In three books beginning with ''The Rage and the Pride'' (Rizzoli, 2002) and in many interviews, she sharply criticized not only Islamic extremists but also Islam itself. She accused the West of having become too complacent and tolerant to understand the threat she believed Islam presented.         The ''sons of Allah breed like rats,'' she wrote, condemning the growing immigration of Muslims in Europe, including her homeland.         ''Europe is no longer Europe,'' she told The Wall Street Journal in 2005. ''It is 'Eurabia,' a colony of Islam, where the Islamic invasion does not proceed only in a physical sense, but also in a mental and cultural sense. Servility to the invaders has poisoned democracy, with obvious consequences for the freedom of thought, and for the concept itself of liberty.''         Her warnings endeared her to many conservatives and won her, a lifelong atheist, an audience with Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. But she was also accused of racism, and in Switzerland and Italy she was charged with violating laws against vilifying religion. In 2003, the left-wing Italian newspaper La Repubblica called her an ''exhibitionist posing as the Joan of Arc of the West.''         Born June 29, 1929, in Florence, she was made a lookout for the Italian Resistance at the age of 10 by her antifascist father, Edoardo, a cabinet maker. The early brush with danger became a pattern.         As a journalist, she covered wars from Vietnam to Central Asia to South America. In Mexico City in 1968, days before the Summer Olympics were to begin there, she was shot three times, dragged down steps by the hair by soldiers and left for dead in clashes in which several hundred protesters were killed.         ''Alas, nothing reveals man the way war does,'' she told an interviewer in 2001. ''Nothing so accentuates in him the beauty and ugliness, the intelligence and foolishness, the brutishness and humanity, the courage and cowardice, the enigma.''         But it was her interviews that made her famous and her books staples on college campuses around the world. Never married, she fell in love with one of her subjects, the Greek poet and activist Alekos Panagoulis, who was convicted of trying to assassinate Greece's military ruler, George Papadapoulos, in 1967. Mr. Panagoulis was killed in 1976 in a car crash that Ms. Fallaci maintained was an assassination. Her novel ''A Man'' was a barely concealed story of his life.         Her other books included a collection of her interviews, ''Interview with History'' (1976); ''If the Sun Dies'' (1966), about the American space program; ''Letter to a Child Unborn'' (1976), a novel about a single woman's conversation with a child she aborted; and ''The Force of Reason'' (2006), on Islam, Europe and the angry reaction to her post-Sept. 11 book ''The Rage and the Pride.''         In recent years she was a private and solitary figure, working out of her townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and visiting Florence and a house she owns in Tuscany. She is survived by a sister, Paola, who was with her when she died, Italian news reports said.         For a woman who relentlessly prodded her interview subjects into self revelation, Ms. Fallaci said she did not like to talk about herself.         ''To speak of oneself means to lay bare one's own soul, expose it like a body to the sun,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To lay bare one's own soul is not at all like taking off one's brassiere on a crowded beach!''         Correction:  September 21, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Saturday about the iconoclastic Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci misstated the title of one of her books and its publication date, and described incorrectly an element of the plot. The English title of the book is "Letter to a Child Never Born," not "Letter to a Child Unborn." It was published in 1975, not 1976, and it is about a single woman's conversation with a child that she ultimately miscarried, not aborted.       
         Hélène Deschamps Adams, who as a teenager in France defied death by spying for groups resisting Nazi occupiers and their collaborators, and later for the United States, died on Sept. 16 in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Karyn Anick Monget, who noted that her mother had a variety of maladies, including pneumonia.         Hélène Deschamps came from a military family, was a tomboy and hated the thought of the Nazis' taking over her country. This combination propelled her to volunteer to fight with the French Resistance. Her youthful looks, insouciance and an accent German soldiers found delightful helped provide cover.         She reported on airfield locations, German mines and antiaircraft and camouflaged emplacements along the shores of the Mediterranean. She saved American parachutists from capture at drop zones and helped Jewish families escape to Spain.         ''Hélène was a very gutsy young woman,'' Henry Hyde, the chief of American intelligence in France during World War II, said in an interview in ''Women in the Resistance'' by Margaret L. Rossiter (Praeger, 1985). ''She went through the lines for us, observing German defense installations and order of battle,'' he said. ''She took many risks and was a genuinely good operator.''         She was captured by resistance fighters from another resistance group while carrying fake German papers and was almost executed. A close friend she regarded as a sister, whom she had recruited to spy with her, was killed by a sniper while she was in the back seat of a car driven by Ms. Deschamps, who then quickly had to dig the grave.         She hid in a closet full of apples while drunken Germans tormented her French protectors. She watched in silent terror as Nazi soldiers brutalized a pregnant woman at a roadside.         In an interview with CNN in 1996, Mrs. Deschamps Adams said her years of espionage had ''no glamour, no romance, no dinner at the embassy in a designer gown.''         There was only a necessary job, she said. ''You have to forget your own feelings.''         Gratitude was never plentiful. Mrs. Deschamps Adams's daughter said her mother never got the pension that she said had been promised by someone in the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime spy agency that was the C.I.A.'s precursor. She got no awards from governments until 2000, when the United States gave her the Distinguished Service Medal and France recognized her heroism in a joint ceremony.         She did find love on the battlefield. After a whirlwind weekend with an American first lieutenant, Forest E. Adams, whom she met while he was on furlough, she accepted his marriage proposal and came to the United States with him in 1946. Their daughter said neither knew much of the other's language, but shared what her mother called ''the language of love.''         Mr. Adams died of a heart attack in 1951, and Mrs. Deschamps Adams never remarried. Karyn, a baby at the time of her father's death, said her mother told her she never met a man as good as the one she lost.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Deschamps Adams is survived by a brother, Henri Deschamps of Maraussan, France.         Hélène Marguerite Deschamps was born on Jan. 30, 1921, in the French concession of what was then called Tientsin, China, and was raised in Senegal, Madagascar and Réunion, an island department of France in the Indian Ocean. Her father, a general in the French colonial army, retired to Aix-en-Provence, in the south of France, in the late 1930's.         She was studying in a convent when Hitler invaded France in 1940. The advice of her mentor, a French colonel who had been a friend of her father's, was to ''join the Red Cross or something,'' not the underground.         She had no special training when she and the friend she recruited began riding their bicycles to spy on German troops -- some of whom gallantly helped with bike repairs.         She was given the code name Anick and posed as a secretary at the headquarters of the Milice, the special police force known as the French Gestapo. She stole the records of people marked for execution, including Jews and resistance fighters, and stuffed them in her brassiere, her daughter said, then flushed them down the toilet.         She suffered a permanent back injury when she was beaten by a French interrogator, and was partly deaf because she walked into a building where she knew a bomb had been planted, and it went off just as she was leaving.         When she became disillusioned with the resistance because so many anti-Nazi groups were competing against one another, a resistance leader arranged for her to meet an O.S.S. agent, who accepted her on the strength of the leader's word.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Deschamps Adams worked on a Lockheed assembly line and then taught French in many places, including Iran, Hawaii, Germany and Bermuda. She wrote two memoirs, ''The Secret War'' (W. H. Allen, 1980) and ''Spyglass: An Autobiography'' (Henry Holt, 1995).         In the introduction to ''Spyglass,'' she asked a question: ''If you had to renounce family, friends, any kind of a normal lifestyle to fight a fierce enemy, would you?''       
         Dr. Olga Jonasson, a transplant surgeon and medical administrator who played an early and leading role in encouraging women to enter male-dominated surgical specialties, died on Aug. 30 in Chicago. She was 72.         The death was confirmed by colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where Dr. Jonasson was a professor of surgery from 1975 to 1987.         Beginning in the 60's, Dr. Jonasson (pronounced JOHN-uh-sun) was a prominent figure in a field in which women were unusual and few held positions of authority. Decades later, when she joined Ohio State University in the late 1980's, Dr. Jonasson was believed to be the only woman serving as head of a university department of surgery.         In 1978, she explained to The New York Times, ''The decisions of the surgeon as team leader are final, and men have simply been unwilling to accept women in that role of the all-powerful decision maker.''         As a clinician and researcher, Dr. Jonasson was interested in immunological questions in organ transplantation, especially in kidney and pancreas transplants. She studied antirejection drugs, known as immunosuppressors, that fool the body's immune system into accepting unfamiliar tissue and organs.         At Illinois, she helped found a laboratory to test for compatibility between organ donors and potential recipients. She also wrote about the surgical complications of operating on patients with diabetes. Earlier in her career, Dr. Jonasson helped examine the potential for a harmful dispersal of tumor cells into the bloodstream when tumors are removed during surgery.         Dr. Truman O. Anderson, a former dean of the Illinois medical school, recalled Dr. Jonasson's ''remarkable skills as a surgeon'' and her facility in teaching residents and surgeons in training.         She ''proved that in teaching students setting an example is more than important -- it is the only thing,'' Dr. Anderson said.         The daughter of a nurse, Olga Jonasson was born in Peoria, Ill. She attended Northwestern University and in 1958, she received her medical degree from the University of Illinois.         After training at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and at Massachusetts General Hospital, she was named an instructor in surgery at Illinois in 1963. She remained as a professor of surgery before moving to Ohio State in 1987.         From 1977 to 1987, she was chief of surgery at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. She was also a former chief of the division of transplantation surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital.         In 1985, she was appointed to a federal panel of physicians and administrators assembled to advise the secretary of health and human services about the safety of antirejection drugs in transplant surgery.         Dr. Jonasson left no immediate survivors.       
         Marcia Tucker, a forceful curator who responded to being fired from the Whitney Museum of American Art by founding the New Museum of Contemporary Art, died on Tuesday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 66.         Ms. Tucker learned several years ago that she had cancer, but a spokeswoman for the New Museum did not specify the cause of death.         In establishing the New Museum in 1977 when she was 37, Ms. Tucker continued the proactive impulses of an older generation of women who helped create the foremost modern art museums in New York: Abby Aldrich Rockefeller of the Museum of Modern Art, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Juliana Force of the Whitney and Hilla Rebay of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.         But Ms. Tucker, who was born in Brooklyn, came of age in the 1960's and was a product of her time. She said that her motto in founding the museum was, ''Act first, think later -- that way you have something to think about.''         Her encounters with feminism in college became the basis of a political activism that permeated much of what she did. But it was balanced by an omnivorous passion for art. In the early 1970's she belonged to the Redstockings, a feminist group. In the 1980's it was often rumored that she belonged to the gorilla-masked Guerrilla Girls, feminist watchdogs of the art world. Later she helped form an a cappella singing group called the Art Mob (singing alto) and also sometimes performed as a stand-up comedian.         In a sense she made the New Museum, which she ran for 22 years as director, in her own image: a somewhat chaotic, idealistic place where the nature of art was always in question, exhibitions were a form of consciousness raising and mistakes were inevitable. She also wanted the museum to welcome art that was excluded elsewhere because it was difficult, out of fashion, unsalable or made by artists who were not white or male or straight.         The daughter of a trial lawyer, Ms. Tucker was born Marcia Silverman and grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and then New Jersey in a household that took politics and culture seriously. Drawn to art from an early age, she studied theater and art at Connecticut College, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1961 and spent her junior year at the École du Louvre in Paris.         Her first job was as a secretary in the department of prints and drawings at the Museum of Modern Art; she soon quit because she was asked to sharpen too many pencils. She went on to earn a master's degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and worked as an editorial associate at Art News magazine.         She also supported herself by cataloging private collections, including those of Alfred H. Barr Jr., the first director of the Museum of Modern Art, and the independently wealthy painter William N. Copley. She was especially close with Mr. Barr and his wife, Margaret Scolari Barr.         Ms. Tucker acquired her surname Tucker in an early marriage. Survivors include her current husband, Dean McNeil; their daughter, Ruby; and her brother, Warren Silverman.         In 1969 Ms. Tucker became a curator of painting and sculpture at the Whitney. She almost immediately helped point the museum in a new direction with ''Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials,'' the first large show of Process Art, or Post-Minimalism, in an American museum, organized with James Monte, another Whitney curator.         Her subsequent shows included surveys of the painters James Rosenquist, Joan Mitchell and Al Held, and the Post-Minimalists Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman and Richard Tuttle. The harsh reviews of the ephemeral, hard-to-find artworks in the Tuttle show eventually led to her dismissal in 1977.         That same year, after assembling a board of trustees that included the philanthropist Vera List, she opened the New Museum on Fifth Avenue at 14th Street, on the ground floor of a building owned by what is now the New School.         At the New Museum she emphasized inclusive group shows with provocative titles like '' 'Bad' Painting'' and ''Bad Girls,'' insisted that the museum guards be knowledgeable about the art on view and planned to de-accession the collection every decade to keep the museum young. She served as series editor of ''Documentary Sources in Contemporary Art,'' five anthologies of theory and criticism.         Her most notorious show, ''Have You Attacked America Today?,'' caused garbage cans to be thrown through the plate-glass window of the museum, which had by then moved to Broadway in SoHo. (The museum is constructing a new $35 million building on the Lower East Side, which is expected to open late next year. Until then it is sharing gallery space with the Chelsea Art Museum.)         John Walsh, then director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., described Ms. Tucker in especially apt terms in a 1993 article in The New York Times: ''There's always been a social conscience in Marcia that's impatient and results in a kind of alertness you can just read across her forehead like a Jenny Holzer sign.''       
         Mary Orr, an actress and writer whose first short story, about a scheming ingénue named Eve Harrington, became the Oscar-winning film ''All About Eve,'' died on Sept. 22 in Manhattan. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, her niece Jessica Ivan said. Ms. Orr, who used the name Mary Orr Denham in private life, was a longtime resident of Manhattan.         Titled ''The Wisdom of Eve,'' Ms. Orr's story appeared in the May 1946 issue of Cosmopolitan. The film version, written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was released in 1950. It starred Bette Davis as the theatrical grande dame Margo Channing and Anne Baxter as Eve. The movie won six Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best screenplay.         Just nine pages long, Ms. Orr's story was fleshed out considerably to make a feature-length film. But in her version, the familiar antagonists are already in place: the insidious Eve, and the eminent actress -- Ms. Orr called her Margola Cranston -- whom Eve cultivates and soon betrays. The role of the caddish drama critic Addison DeWitt, for which George Sanders won an Oscar, was invented for the film.         ''A young girl is on her way to Hollywood with a contract for one thousand dollars a week from a major film company in her pocketbook,'' Ms. Orr's story begins. It continues: ''In a year or two I am sure Miss Harrington will be as much of a household word to you as Ingrid Bergman or Joan Fontaine.''         The short story is narrated by a playwright's young wife (Celeste Holm in the film), who becomes entangled with Eve. In the movie, Eve gets her comeuppance, but in Ms. Orr's version, she gets away with everything, including the narrator's husband.         By all accounts, there really was an Eve. In 1943, a play called ''The Two Mrs. Carrolls'' opened on Broadway, starring the noted Viennese actress Elisabeth Bergner. It was directed by Reginald Denham, whom Ms. Orr would marry in 1947.         Night after night, as Ms. Bergner later told Ms. Orr, a waiflike young woman stood outside the stage door. Taking pity on her, Ms. Bergner eventually invited the woman into her dressing room and later engaged her as a secretary.         As recounted by Sam Staggs in ''All About 'All About Eve' '' (St. Martin's, 2000), the woman repaid Ms. Bergner by trying to take over both her acting career and her husband, the director Paul Czinner.         After hearing Ms. Bergner's tale, Ms. Orr wrote it up and sold it to Cosmopolitan for $800. In 1949 a radio dramatization of the story, written by Ms. Orr and broadcast on NBC, caught Hollywood's attention.         Ms. Orr, who was paid $5,000 for the film rights, received no onscreen credit. (Her original story was credited, however, when ''Applause,'' a musical version of ''All About Eve,'' opened on Broadway in 1970. The musical starred Lauren Bacall as Margo and Penny Fuller as Eve.)         Mary Caswell Orr was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 21, 1910, and moved with her family to Canton, Ohio, as a girl. She attended Syracuse University before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.         With her husband, Ms. Orr wrote four plays that opened on Broadway. The first and most successful, ''Wallflower,'' ran for 192 performances in 1944. She also acted in several Broadway productions, among them ''The Desperate Hours'' in 1955.         Ms. Orr's husband, Mr. Denham, died in 1983. Besides her niece, Ms. Ivan, of Hartville, Ohio, she is survived by another niece, Lenschen Witte, of Alliance, Ohio, and three step-grandchildren.         In its July 1951 issue, Cosmopolitan published another story by Ms. Orr. Titled ''More About Eve,'' it picks up three years after ''The Wisdom of Eve'' leaves off. After middling success in Hollywood, Eve Harrington is back in New York, determined to revive her career. How she does so makes her earlier evil deeds look like child's play.       
         Elizabeth Allen, a leading actress on Broadway and in movies who got her start as the ''Away we go!'' girl on ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' in the 1950's, died Sept. 19 in Fishkill, N.Y. She was 77.         The cause was kidney failure, her sister-in-law, Marion Gillease, said.         Ms. Allen played major roles in five Broadway shows and in six movies, appeared on numerous television shows, including ''Kojak'' and ''Mannix,'' and sang at the Stork Club in New York. She was twice nominated for Tony Awards: in 1962 for best featured actress in a musical in ''The Gay Life,'' and in 1965 for best actress in a musical in ''Do I Hear a Waltz?''         Elizabeth Ellen Gillease was born on Jan. 25, 1929, in Jersey City, the daughter of Viola and Joseph Gillease. Her marriage in 1953 to a German baron, Karl von Vietinghoff-Scheel, ended in divorce. She left no immediate survivors.         As a teenager, Ms. Gillease, a tall, willowy brunette, was noticed by a photographer as she walked on Madison Avenue. That led to a five-year career as a fashion model. In 1953, she tried out for a bit part on the Gleason show and was chosen instead to introduce the program with what became its trademark proclamation, ''And away we go!''         While on the Gleason show, Ms. Allen also worked as a costume designer for a production of ''Hamlet'' by the Helen Hayes Equity Group. One day, Ms. Allen recalled, Ms. Hayes noticed that she unwaveringly would watch every rehearsal and said to her, ''I think you're in the wrong end of the business.'' Ms. Allen began playing roles with the company's national touring troupe.         Her big break came on a Saturday night in October 1957. While working in an industrial show in Detroit, Ms. Allen received a phone call asking her to return to New York to read for the role of Juliet in the Peter Ustinov comedy ''Romanoff and Juliet.'' The show was scheduled to open in five days, but there had been difficulty with the actress cast as Juliet. Ms. Allen had been recommended by Jack Manning, the director of the Hayes touring troupe.         She flew to New York on a Sunday and read for Mr. Ustinov and the producer David Merrick on Monday. Wherever she went during the next three days, including while her hair was being dyed red, she was trailed by someone helping her memorize the script. On Thursday night, the show opened.         Ms. Allen's Broadway roles and television appearances led to her Hollywood career. Among other major film roles, she played in ''Diamond Head'' with Charlton Heston, in ''Donovan's Reef'' with John Wayne and in ''From the Terrace'' with Paul Newman.         In 1965, Ms. Allen received her best-actress Tony nomination for the role of Leona Samish in Richard Rodgers's musical ''Do I Hear a Waltz?,'' about an American secretary seeking, but not quite finding, romance while on vacation in Venice.         ''I hated being remembered as the 'Away we go!' girl,'' Ms. Allen once said. ''Now I love it, because so many people liked it. It's flattering.''       
         Wang Guangmei, the widow of President Liu Shaoqi and a powerful figure in China before she was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, died Friday in Beijing. She was 85.         Her death was confirmed by a family member.         Ms. Wang was once widely known in China as its beautiful, articulate, sophisticated first lady.         Liu Shaoqi was president from 1959 to 1967, when he became one of the first high-level officials to be denounced as a ''capitalist roader'' and purged by Mao during the Cultural Revolution.         Mr. Liu died in prison in 1969, after being beaten and tortured. Ms. Wang was also arrested and accused of being an American spy.         In some of the uglier scenes of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, she was publicly humiliated at mass rallies by a group of Red Guards who forced her to wear a necklace of Ping-Pong balls.         After Mao's death in 1976, Mr. Liu was rehabilitated by the Communist Party, and the notorious Gang of Four, who were accused of conspiring on Mao's behalf, were imprisoned and put on trial.         Ms. Wang spent about 12 years in prison, and her four children were also harshly treated. She was released in 1979, just before Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, a leader of the Gang of Four, was put on trial and accused of leading the effort to destroy President Liu and his wife.         Wang Guangmei was born in 1921 and grew up in a distinguished and prominent Chinese family. Her father was a government minister and a diplomat; her mother was an educator.         Ms. Wang studied French, Russian and English, and earned a degree in physics from Furen Catholic University in Beijing. She also studied at an American missionary university.         In the mid-1940's, however, she traveled to the Communist Party headquarters in Yanan and served as an interpreter during efforts by the American statesman George C. Marshall to negotiate a truce between the Nationalist government and the Communist rebels.         There, at the age of 24, she met Liu Shaoqi, who was nearly twice her age and had married five times before.         For years she served as his secretary, and he was named a key deputy to Mao after the Communists took power in 1949. In 1959 Mr. Liu was named president, making him the second most powerful man in the country.         In the early 1960's, the couple traveled abroad on state visits to Afghanistan, Burma, Pakistan and Indonesia.         But in 1966, Ms. Wang was part of a group that purged the party leadership of Tsinghua University, and the effort backfired when she came under attack by a militant opponent who accused her of being a counterrevolutionary. This came at a time when her husband was also under fire by Mao and his deputies as being the leading ''capitalist roader.''         Jiang Qing, Mao's fifth wife, was said to be jealous and angry with Ms. Wang and to have complained about the way she dressed, noting that she even wore a pearl necklace on a trip abroad.         The disgraced Mr. Liu died in prison. Ms. Wang was put under house arrest, then imprisoned. Her four children were also punished.         After she was released from prison in 1979, however, she was appointed a member of the National People's Congress standing committee, and she devoted herself to social causes. She even donated some of her family's valuable antiques, a few dating back to the Qing and Song dynasties, to charity.         She is survived by four children, some of whom have risen to prominent positions.         Her eldest son, Lt. Gen. Liu Yuan, was appointed a political commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences, a rank equivalent to a cabinet minister, according to Reuters.         Her daughter, Ting Liu, graduated from Boston University and Harvard Business School and is chairman and president of the Asia Link Group, consultants in corporate finance.       
         Ruth S. Morgenthau, a former professor of international politics at Brandeis University and an adviser to President Jimmy Carter on rural development in poor countries, died on Saturday in Boston. She was 75 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         The death was confirmed by her daughter, Sarah Morgenthau Wessel.         An advocate of ''bottom-up'' aid to farmers and villagers in the third world, Mrs. Morgenthau was the Adlai Stevenson Professor Emeritus of International Politics at Brandeis, where she taught from 1963 to 2003. She also founded the university's graduate program in international sustainable development.         ''She combined academic expertise with a practitioner's reality and, in the process, became one of the acknowledged experts in the world on development issues,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a senior official in the Carter and Clinton administrations. ''She really helped shape President Carter's thinking on making Africa a priority for his administration.''         In 1982, Mrs. Morgenthau and Robert Hecht, then a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis, wrote an Op-Ed article for The New York Times asserting that the ''top-down'' approach to aid in Africa did not work because bureaucracies ''soak up resources.''         ''With the bottom-up approach,'' the article said, ''villagers' skills, tools and limited savings can be fully mobilized, and relatively small foreign aid contributions flow directly into rural communities.'' Mrs. Morgenthau put that approach to work as chairwoman of Pact, a coalition with aid programs in 20 nations.         Ruth Schachter Morgenthau was born in Vienna on Jan. 26, 1931. Her parents, Osias and Mizia Kramer Schachter, owned a textile importing company until they fled from the Nazis in 1940.         In addition to her daughter, of Montclair, N.J., Mrs. Morgenthau is survived by her husband of 44 years, Henry Morgenthau III, a television producer and author whose father was treasury secretary in the Roosevelt administration. She is also survived by two sons, H. Ben, of San Francisco, and Kramer, of Los Angeles; a sister, Alice Barzilay of Manhattan; and three grandchildren. Her brother-in-law, Robert M. Morgenthau, is the Manhattan district attorney.         Mrs. Morgenthau graduated from Barnard College in 1952, then attended the Institut d'Études Politiques in Paris as a Fulbright scholar. In 1958, she received a doctorate in politics from Oxford. In 1964, she wrote ''Political Parties in French-Speaking West Africa'' (Oxford University Press). She was a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations, and in 1988 ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for Congress in Rhode Island.         Last year, Mrs. Morgenthau was a member of a committee created by the Center for Global Development, a Washington research group, to assess the danger posed by poor nations. Mr. Eizenstat, who also worked on the committee, said she was a prime shaper of the report and had emphasized that aid was central to American security because poor nations were becoming havens for terrorists and criminals.         Correction:  November 14, 2006, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Sunday about Ruth S. Morgenthau, a scholar of international politics and a presidential adviser on aid to third world countries, misstated the date of her death. It was Nov. 4, not Saturday.       
         Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the Reagan administration's first United Nations ambassador and a beacon of neoconservative thought who helped guide American military, diplomatic and covert action from 1981 to 1985, died Thursday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 80.         Her death was announced yesterday by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, where she was a senior fellow. The cause was congestive heart failure, said her personal assistant, Tammy Jagyur.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was the first American woman to serve as United Nations ambassador. She was the only woman, and the only Democrat, in President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council. No woman had ever been so close to the center of presidential power without actually residing in the White House.         ''When she put her feet under the desk of the Oval Office, the president listened,'' said William P. Clark Jr., Mr. Reagan's national security adviser during 1982 and 1983. ''And he usually agreed with her.''         President Reagan brought her into his innermost foreign policy circle, the National Security Planning Group. There she weighed the risks and rewards of clandestine warfare in Central America, covert operations against Libya, the disastrous deployment of American marines in Lebanon, the invasion of Grenada and support for rebel forces in Afghanistan.         Her public diplomacy made her a national political figure. She was a star performer at the 1984 Republican national convention, deriding the Democrats as the ''blame America first'' party.         She changed her political affiliation after leaving the Reagan administration and thought hard about seeking the Republican nomination for president.         ''So many people talked to me about it so much that they finally persuaded me to consider it,'' she said in October 1987. But she decided against it, fearing she would split the conservative vote and help elect Vice President George H. W. Bush. Though he won, she thought him too moderate to inherit the Reagan legacy.         Fifteen years later, in March 2003, President Bush recalled Ambassador Kirkpatrick to active duty and sent her to Geneva, said Alan Gerson, who had served as her general counsel at the United Nations. The secret mission, previously undisclosed, was to head off a diplomatic uprising against the imminent war against Iraq. Arab ministers wanted to condemn it as an act of aggression.         ''The marching orders we received were to argue that pre-emptive war is legitimate,'' Mr. Gerson said. ''She said: 'No one will buy it. If that's the position, count me out.' ''         Instead, she argued that the attack was justified by Saddam Hussein's violations of United Nations resolutions dating from the 1991 war against Iraq. The foreign ministers found her position convincing and their resolve against the war faded, Mr. Gerson said.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was a political science professor with no diplomatic experience when she arrived at the United Nations in February 1981. Her mission was to wage rhetorical warfare against Moscow and its allies. She sought to restore the international standing of the United States after its defeat in Vietnam and the captivity of Americans in Iran.         Her high-profile performance at the United Nations made her President Reagan's favorite envoy. ''You're taking off that big sign that we used to wear that said, 'Kick Me,' '' the president told her. He admired her strong diplomatic stands and her undiplomatic language. In a letter to 40 third world ambassadors in October 1981, for example, she accused them of spreading ''base lies'' and making ''malicious attacks upon the good name of the United States.''         When nations opposed American foreign policy, she sent their voting records to Congress. The threat was tacit but clear: to stand against the United States meant to risk losing its foreign aid. Her deputy at the United Nations, Kenneth L. Adelman, said she enjoyed such close combat.         ''We were like Davy Crockett at the Alamo,'' he said.         Said She Hated U.N. Job         She professed to detest the United Nations. She compared it to ''death and taxes.'' But she endured it for four years.         At the United Nations, she defended Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the American invasion of Grenada in 1983. She argued for El Salvador's right-wing junta and against Nicaragua's left-wing ruling council, the Sandinistas.         In private, she supported American efforts to sustain the contras, the rebel group that tried to overthrow the Sandinistas with help from the Central Intelligence Agency She was a crucial participant in a March 1981 National Security Planning Group meeting that produced a $19 million covert action plan to make the contras a fighting force.         She was part of a national security team that was often at war with itself. Her relationship with Mr. Reagan's first secretary of state, the four-star general Alexander M. Haig Jr., ''started off bad and got worse over time,'' Mr. Adelman said in an oral history of the Reagan years. She had something Mr. Haig found that he lacked: the president's ear.         Ms. Kirkpatrick first entered Mr. Reagan's inner circle on the strength of a 10,000-word article she published in the neoconservative magazine Commentary in November 1979. The article, ''Dictatorships and Double Standards,'' drew a bright line between right-wing pro-American governments and left-wing anti-American ones.         ''Traditional authoritarian governments,'' she argued, ''are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.'' She said it was an historic mistake for the United States to have shied away from dictators like the Somozas in Nicaragua and the Shah of Iran. If they served American interests, she asserted, they were defensible.         Mr. Reagan read the article closely. Richard V. Allen, who later became the first of his six national security advisers, introduced him to Ms. Kirkpatrick. They met at a February 1980 dinner party given by George F. Will, the syndicated columnist.         She recalled that she wondered aloud how she, a Democrat all her life, could join his team. Mr. Reagan confided, ''I was a Democrat once, you know.'' He won her over. After his election a year later, Ms. Kirkpatrick became the United Nations ambassador and ''Dictatorships and Double Standards'' became an important part of the foreign policy of the United States.         At the United Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick was the target of barbs and backstabbing. Sometimes she was aware of the source, sometimes not.         She knew she was ''a kind of special target for the Soviets -- disinformation target,'' she said at a 2003 foreign policy roundtable convened by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. In 1982, the K.G.B. forged a letter to discredit her and fobbed it off on the Washington correspondent for The New Statesman, a leftist British weekly, which reprinted it. The phony letter was a note of ''best regards and gratitude'' from the intelligence chief of the apartheid South African government.         ''But I felt there was as much disinformation aimed at me from inside our own government, frankly, as from the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick said. ''That's a shocking thing to say, but it is no exaggeration.''         Role as Adviser Blocked         In 1983, Ms. Kirkpatrick was a strong candidate to become President Reagan's third national security adviser. She had support from the director of central intelligence, William J. Casey, and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. But her new boss, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, opposed her.         ''I respected her intelligence, but she was not well suited to the job,'' Mr. Shultz wrote. ''Her strength was in her capacity for passionate advocacy,'' and the post, he added, demanded a ''dispassionate broker.''         Ms. Kirkpatrick was at the June 1984 National Security Planning Group meeting that began the secret initiative that later became known as the Iran-contra affair. Congress had cut off funds for the contras. Mr. Casey wanted to obtain money from foreign countries in defiance of the ban.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was in favor. ''We should make the maximum effort to find the money,'' she said. Mr. Shultz was opposed. ''It is an impeachable offense,'' he said. President Reagan warned that if the story leaked, ''we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House.''         Secret Arms Sales Exposed         Over the next two years, millions skimmed from secret arms sales to Iran went to the contras. The story did leak, as Mr. Reagan feared, and his Administration was shaken by Congressional investigations and criminal charges. Robert C. McFarlane, who had won the national security slot over Ms. Kirkpatrick, pleaded guilty to misinforming Congress.         Mr. McFarlane said he should have stood up against the secret initiative to support the contras. But ''if I'd done that,'' he said, ''Bill Casey, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Cap Weinberger would have said I was some kind of commie.''         By then Ms. Kirkpatrick had left the government. She stuck to a vow to leave the United Nations at the end of Mr. Reagan's first term and resigned in April 1985. She was succeeded by Vernon A. Walters, a former deputy director of central intelligence. The next year, as the Iran-contra story began unfolding, Mr. Casey urged the president to make her secretary of state, but Mr. Reagan rejected the idea.         Ms. Kirkpatrick spent the rest of her career commenting on policy instead of making it. She remained among the most highly regarded members of the Republican establishment, and her voice remained one of the strongest echoes of the Reagan era.         Jeane Duane Jordan was born on Nov. 19, 1926, in Duncan, Okla., about 160 miles northwest of Dallas, the daughter of Welcher F. and Leona Jordan. Her father was an oil wildcatter who moved from town to town searching for a gusher that he never hit.         She attended Stephens College in Missouri for two years, then moved to New York, where she earned a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree from Columbia University in 1950. She went to Washington as a research analyst at the Intelligence and Research Bureau of the State Department, where she met her future husband, Evron Kirkpatrick. Fifteen years her senior, he was a veteran of the wartime Office of Strategic Services, and he soon became the head of the American Political Science Association. They married in 1955 and had three sons -- Douglas Jordan, John Evron and Stuart Alan. Douglas died earlier this year. The other sons and five grandchildren survive her. Mr. Kirkpatrick died in 1995.         In 1967, before completing her doctoral dissertation, she was appointed associate professor at Georgetown University. The next year, she earned a doctorate in political science at Columbia University. Georgetown made her a full professor in 1973 and gave her the endowed Leavey Chair five years later.         Ms. Kirkpatrick supported Jimmy Carter in 1976 and came close to being chosen for an ambassadorship in his administration. But she had become deeply disenchanted with her party.         Swept In With 50 Others         She joined the vanguard of the neoconservative movement, the Committee on the Present Danger, which warned throughout the late 1970s of a disastrous downturn in every aspect of American strength, from nuclear warheads to national image. When Mr. Reagan came to office in 1981, 51 of the committee's members won positions of significant power in his administration.         Power, Ms. Kirkpatrick said in a 1996 interview, is based not merely on guns or money but on the strength of personal conviction.         ''We were concerned about the weakening of Western will,'' she said. ''We advocated rebuilding Western strength, and we did that with Ronald Reagan, if I may say so.''
