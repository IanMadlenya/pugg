        Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the         Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Sullivan, who had a busy career both in this country and abroad, gave her last performance March 22 at the Westport Arts Center in Westport, Conn. She entered the hospital April 1, where she suffered a seizure and went into a coma.         Miss Sullivan was born Marietta Williams in Homestead, Pa., on May 13, 1911. She shot to fame in 1937 when she recorded ''Loch Lomond'' in an arrangement by Claude Thornhill, the pianist, who led a small accompanying group on the recording. It was an immediate hit, and she followed it with a series of recordings of swinging folk songs, including ''Molly Malone,'' ''It Was a Lover and His Lass'' and ''If I Had a Ribbon Bow.''         Although singing folk songs appeared to be a novelty at that time, Miss Sullivan was doing it in the very earliest stages of her career, when she was singing at an after-hours club in Pittsburgh called the Benjamin Harrison Literary Society.         Two of her future husbands, the bassist John Kirby and the pianist Cliff Jackson both first heard her singing there.         One of her songs was a musical setting of Joyce Kilmer's poem ''Trees.''         ''I couldn't sing it straight,'' she explained. ''I had no choice but to swing it.'' Married in 1938         The success of ''Loch Lomond'' led to an engagement for her at the Onyx Club on 52d Street. There she sang with a small band led by Mr. Kirby that played in a light and airy style, once described as ''orchestrated finesse'' that was an ideal complement to Miss Sullivan's singing and to her manner when she sang, standing motionless, her chin tilted confidently upward and a slightly mischievous smile lighting her face.         She married Mr. Kirby in 1938 and later she and his band became the stars of a weekly NBC radio network series, ''Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm,'' a precedent-setting event for black performers.         In 1938 Miss Sullivan went from the Onyx Club to Hollywood to appear in the film ''Going Places,'' in which she and Louis Armstrong introduced ''Jeepers Creepers.'' The following year she appeared in a second film, ''St. Louis Blues,'' and also performed on Broadway with Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman in a jazz version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' called ''Swingin' the Dream,'' in which she sang ''Darn That Dream.''         During the 1940's she moved away from her early close association with folk songs, although until her death she could always respect - and respond to - requests for ''Loch Lomond.'' She developed a fresh repertory of standard pop songs such as ''I've Got the World on a String,'' ''Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'' and ''I Got a Right to Sing the Blues.'' Won Tony Award in 1979         In 1950, after her marriage to Mr. Kirby had ended in divorce, she married Mr. Jackson and temporarily retired from singing to raise her daughter, Paula. During these years she developed an interest in physical therapy and nursing and was active in local civic affairs in the Bronx. After Mr. Jackson's death in 1970, she founded the House That Jazz Built, a community center at 1312 Stebbins Avenue in the Bronx. Dedicated to Mr. Jackson, the center continues to serve young people through the efforts of senior citizens.         In 1979 she received a Tony award for her performance in ''My Old Friends,'' a musical on aging that was described by a reviewer for The New York Times as ''jolly yet touching.''         She is survived by her daughter, Paula Morris, and her son, Orville Williams.         A service will be held at 7 P.M. tomorrow at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.

        Cynthia Auerbach, an opera director who was associated with the New York City Opera for 15 years, died Thursday night at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 44 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer.         Cynthia Auerbach, an opera director who was associated with the New York City Opera for 15 years, died Thursday night at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 44 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer.         Educated as a pianist and music theorist, Ms. Auerbach began her stage career at the Manhattan School of Music, where she at first taught music theory and then founded the school's children's opera program in 1969. She had a free-lance career as a director but also held permanent posts at the Chautauqua Opera as artistic director and at the City Opera, where she had been a full member of the directing staff since 1975.         Ms. Auerbach's last directing job was at the American Opera Center at the Juilliard School last February - in a production of Britten's ''Albert Herring.'' At the time, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times of Ms. Auerbach's ''tightly coordinated'' staging and congratulated her for ''shrewdly resisting temptations to let low comedy take over.''         At the City Opera, Ms. Auerbach presided over such revivals as ''Carmen,'' ''The Daughter of the Regiment'' and ''L'Heure Espagnol.'' She also directed the company's new production of ''Les Pecheurs de Perles'' in 1980, which was revived last season. 'American-Made Talent'         Beverly Sills, general director of the City Opera, yesterday described Ms. Auerbach as ''typical of young American-made talent - the kind which has made this country's artists the most versatile in the world. She was feisty and imaginative and so part of our family that she represents a terrible loss.''         Elizabeth Crittenden, her manager at Columbia Artists, remembers Ms. Auerbach as a champion of developing American artists and composers, citing especially her work with young singers at the Texas Opera and at Juilliard and her productions of Carlisle Floyd's ''Of Mice and Men'' and Marc Blitzstein's ''Regina'' at Chautauqua. Ms. Auerbach also directed opera at a score of regional companies in North America, many of them in the American South.         She was born in New York City and received her education at the Juilliard School, the State University of New York at Potsdam and the Manhattan School.         Ms. Auerbach is survived by her father, Percy, now living in Florida, and by two sisters, Ronnie and Lynn, of the New York area. There will be a 2 P.M. service on Sunday at the Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, at 91st Street, in Manhattan.

Dora Zaslavsky Koch, a pianist and teacher at the Manhattan School of Music for over half a century, died Monday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         Ms. Zaslavsky was born in the Ukraine in 1905 and came to the United States as a child. She began piano studies with Janet Schenck, founder of the Neighborhood Music School, which became the Manhattan School of Music, and was the school's first graduate in 1920.         Ms. Zaslavsky continued her studies with Wilhelm Backhaus in Philadelphia and Paris, then returned to New York to take up her teaching career at the Manhattan School. Among her students were David Bar-Ilan and Abbey Simon. In 1984, the school awarded her an honorary doctoral degree. She retired two years ago.         In 1933, Ms. Zaslavsky married John Koch, an artist, who died in 1978. They had no children.         A memorial service for Ms. Zaslavsky will be held at 3 P.M. today at the John C. Borden Auditorium of the Manhattan School of Music, 130 Claremont Avenue.       
        Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Astor entered silent films in 1920 as a willowy 14-year-old and portrayed scores of vulnerable ingenues. Two decades later she gave her most indelible performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' John Huston's crime classic. Her subtle, mature portrayal of a seemingly sympathetic woman who was, in fact, evilly duplicitous, took audiences by surprise. Such women were rarely the heroines of movies then, nor had they been portrayed as deceptively as Miss Astor portrayed the homicidal Brigid O'Shaughnessy.         In the same year, 1941, she was a ruthless, egocentric concert pianist battling Bette Davis in ''The Great Lie,'' for which Miss Astor won an Oscar as the best actress in a supporting role. ''If I'd had my druthers,'' she later wrote, ''I would have preferred getting my Oscar for 'The Maltese Falcon.' '' Sophisticates and Villains         Other skillful characterizations included a warmly urbane widow in ''Dodsworth'' (1936), a spurned mistress in the 1937 version of the swashbuckling ''Prizoner of Zenda,'' a disillusioned wife in ''The Hurricane'' (1937) and a sympathetic prostitute in ''Act of Violence'' (1949).         But few of her films matched the turmoil of her private life. In 1936, she was the center of one of Hollywood's most spectacular scandals when she sued Dr. Franklyn Thorpe for legal custody of their 4-year-old daughter, Marylyn. Dr. Thorpe had divorced Miss Astor a year earlier.         The suit led to disclosure of her diary, which allegedly contained accounts of liaisons with many celebrities. Dr. Thorpe sought to use the diary to prove she was an unfit mother, and purported excerpts were published in newspapers under suggestive headlines.         Miss Astor repeatedly maintained that the excerpts were lurid forgeries. She later acknowledged that an authentic portion published by one newspaper included ''a rather overemotional account of a romantic interlude with George S. Kaufman,'' the playwright.         The trial judge ordered the diary sealed and impounded. It was inadmissible as evidence, she wrote later, because her former husband had removed pages involving himself. Miss Astor was granted custody of her daughter for nine months a year, with Dr. Thorpe allowed custody the three other months. The diary was never made public, and a judge witnessed its burning in 1952. Won Beauty Contest at 11         During the 30-day trial, Hollywood producers, fearing the scandal would damage the film industry, pressed Miss Astor to drop the suit, but she refused, risking her reputation and career to keep her daughter. Soon after the trial, throngs of people hailed her courage when she toured with screenings of ''Dodsworth.''         Mary Astor was born Lucile Langhanke on May 3, 1906, in Quincy, Ill., the only child of the former Helen Vasconcells, an American, and Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke, a German immigrant who made an uncertain income from such diverse activities as teaching German and poultry farming until he began to cash in on his daughter's film success.         The girl won her first movie contract with Famous Players-Lasky and, with it, the name Mary Astor. Within two years she was making features and her salary started soaring. In 1923, the family went to Hollywood and she became John Barrymore's leading lady in ''Beau Brummel.''         She was teamed with Barrymore again in ''Don Juan'' (1926), which introduced a Vitaphone background-music soundtrack, the harbinger of talkies. Her early sound films included ''Holiday'' (1930), playing the materialistic sister of Ann Harding, and ''Red Dust'' (1932), in which she portrayed a frustrated wife attracted to Clark Gable. Sued for Nonsupport by Parents         Later movies included ''Midnight'' (1939), ''Brigham Young - Frontiersman'' (1940), ''Across the Pacific'' (1942), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942), ''Claudia and David'' (1946) and ''Return to Peyton Place'' (1961).         Miss Astor's professional successes were punctuated by personal tragedies. In 1930, her first husband, Kenneth Hawks, was killed in a plane crash while directing a movie.         Her parents lived lavishly, taking nearly all her salary, but in 1934 she put them on an allowance. Unable to continue embellishing the mansion and estate she had given them, they sued her for nonsupport. She said that ''from 1920 to 1930, I gave my father $461,000'' while she kept only $24,000. She agreed to pay them $100 a month, and the suit was dismissed.         After the diary scandal, Miss Astor was married to Manuel del Campo, a Mexican sportsman, by whom she had a son, Anthony, and later to Thomas G. Wheelock, a businessman. Both marriages ended in divorce. A Drinking Problem         Her tangled personal life and the financial pressures to keep working worsened a longtime drinking problem. She sought help from a priest-psychologist, the Rev. Peter Ciklic, and to further her therapy, he had her write notes about her life. At his urging, she revised the notes into a 1959 autobiography, ''My Story.'' It was praised by reviewers for its style and uncompromising insights.         Personally regenerated, she began writing novels and completed a successful memoir on movie making, ''A Life on Film,'' in 1971. Her first novel, ''The Incredible Charlie Carewe,'' about a charming rotter, was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as ''lively entertainment.''         In ''A Life on Film,'' Miss Astor deplored a ''poverty of spirit'' in many contemporary movies, writing that ''whatever we did - we old moviemakers - we gave people a lot of fun. Through depressions and wars and calamities, we gave them the sense of glory, of a future that would be braver than today.''         Miss Astor retired to the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills in 1974 and contributed to it from her writing income.         Besides her daughter and son, the actress is survived by an undisclosed number of grandchildren. A funeral service will be private.       
        Jacqueline du Pre, a brilliant and charismatic English cellist whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, died last night in London, her concert managers said. She was 42 years old.         Jacqueline du Pre, a brilliant and charismatic English cellist whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, died last night in London, her concert managers said. She was 42 years old.         Miss du Pre, who was stricken with the disease in 1971, had a career that lasted barely a decade. But during her prime she was recognized as one of the world's leading cellists, and served as a role model for many young musicians. During the late 1960's and early 1970's, Miss du Pre and her husband, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, seemed a charmed couple. Often compared with Robert and Clara Schumann, they were admired for their energy, musicality and youthful glamour.         Miss du Pre's playing was characterized by an unusual mixture of elegance and ferocity. ''Miss du Pre is a cellist in the modern vein,'' Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times after a 1967 concert. ''There is plenty of strength to her playing, and a good measure of romanticism without the romantic string mannerisms of portamento (sliding from note to note) and a fast wide vibrato. She can produce a mellow sound of unusual size and clearly was born to play the cello.''         Miss du Pre excelled in a wide variety of music, specializing in the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and the concertos of Haydn, Boccherini, Schumann, Dvorak and Saint-Saens. She had a particular affinity for English music, and made memorable recordings of the Delius and Elgar concertos. The Elgar was associated more closely with her than with any other cellist since Beatrice Harrison, who died in 1965.         Raymond Ericson, reviewing a 1965 performance of the Elgar work for The Times, observed that ''Miss du Pre and the concerto seemed made for each other, because her playing was so completely imbued with the romantic spirit. Her tone was sizable and beautifully burnished. Her technique was virtually flawless, whether she was playing the sweeping chords that open the concerto, sustaining a ravishing pianissimo tone, or keeping the fast repeated note figures in the scherzo going at an even pace.'' 'Couldn't Feel the Strings'         The first signs of Miss du Pre's illness appeared when she was 26 years old and at the height of her fame. ''My hands no longer worked,'' she recalled in 1978. ''I simply couldn't feel the strings.'' She withdrew from concertizing for one year, then returned, to mixed reviews. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis followed shortly, and Miss du Pre retired.         By the mid-70's, Miss du Pre was virtually paralyzed. She could no longer dress herself, nor stand unaided, nor travel without a great deal of planning. She put all of her energies into two major activities - teaching, whenever possible, and working for the cause of multiple sclerosis research.         ''I had to learn to reconstruct my life,'' she said in 1978. ''But I have found a great deal to do. I go to concerts and see my friends. And the music is still alive in my head.''         Jacqueline du Pre was born in Oxford, England, on Jan. 26, 1945. Her talent was obvious from an early age, and she began cello lessons when she was 5 years old. Her early teachers included Herbert Walenn and William Pleeth; she later studied with Paul Tortelier, Mstislav Rostropovich and Pablo Casals. At the age of 11 she won her first competition, and she eventually took every possible prize for cellists at the Guildhall School of Music.         Her career began in earnest in 1961, when she played a concert at Wigmore Hall in London, using a 1672 Stradivarius that had been presented to her anonymously. ''She was immediately acclaimed for her instinctive feeling for style and breadth of understanding as well as technical proficiency,'' Noel Goodwin wrote in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. When Mr. Rostropovich first heard her play, he remarked that he had found somebody to carry on his work. Married in June 1967         Miss du Pre met Daniel Barenboim at a party in London in 1966. ''Instead of saying good evening,'' she later recalled, ''we sat down and played Brahms.'' They were married in June 1967. Together, they helped begin the South Bank Summer Musical Festival in London the following year.         Mr. Barenboim was once asked what it was like to accompany his wife. ''Difficult,'' he replied. ''It doesn't dawn on her sometimes that we mortals have difficulties in following her.'' In the next few years, they performed throughout the world, both separately and as a duo.         After her incapacitation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, in tandem with an organization called the Jacqueline du Pre Research Fund, presented several benefit concerts at Carnegie Hall. Among the participants were the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the pianist Eugene Istomin and several others. Reviewing a 1980 concert, John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times: ''The consistently high quality of these particular benefits can be traced to the close professional and social circle in which Miss du Pre and her husband move. They know the best, and the best play at their benefits.''         In 1981, Miss du Pre's story became the subject of a Broadway play, ''Duet for One,'' by Tom Kempinski, which starred Anne Bancroft and Max von Sydow.         Throughout her illness, Miss du Pre remained sanguine about the future. ''Nobody knows if I'll ever regain mobility,'' she said in 1978. ''It could be that next week I'll find myself walking down the road. I believe in realistic optimism but not wishful thinking.''         She is survived by her husband.

Dana Suesse, a composer and songwriter whose hits included ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' died of a stroke last Friday in New York City. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Suesse, who also wrote ''Whistling in the Dark,'' ''My Silent Love'' and ''Blue Moonlight,'' achieved widespread fame in 1932 when the orchestra leader Paul Whiteman commissioned her to write a jazz concerto for piano and orchestra. The work, ''Concerto in Three Rhythms,'' was such a success that the next year, another Whiteman commission, ''Symphonic Waltzes,'' followed.         Miss Suesse, who was born in Shreveport, La., in 1911, came to New York in 1931 with her mother, an opera singer, and began working as a songwriter; her first hit was ''Have You Forgotten?'' in 1931. Her best-known song, ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' written in 1934 with Edward Heyman, has remained Hollywood's anthem for 52 years.         In 1936 she wrote the score for Billy Rose's ''Casa Manana'' revue, and later collaborated with him on his ''Aquacade'' revue at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Miss Suesse also worked with the lyricists Harold Adamson, E. Y. Harburg, Irving Kahl and Leo Robin.         In the late 1940's, Miss Suesse studied composition with Nadia Boulanger. She was also a pianist, and appeared as soloist in many of her own works.         Miss Suesse is survived by her stepson, Charles DeLincks.       
        Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Miss Kryl was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1897, but lived most of her early life in Chicago, where she studied with the well-known pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz.         Her father, Bohumir Kryl, a bank president, art collector, composer and bandmaster, so wanted his daughters, Marie and Josephine, to become musicians that, in 1921, he promised them each $100,000 if they would not marry before reaching age 30. They both agreed.         But neither daughter lived up to her vow. Josephine, a violinist of note, married the composer Paul Taylor White before turning 30. Marie forfeited her fortune when, in 1926, she became engaged to a Greek Count, Spiro Hadji-Kyriacos. A year later, however, the engagement was broken, and in 1932, she married Michel Gusikoff, a composer and a former assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony.

She was 76 years old and lived in White Plains.         Mrs. Sebner, who was born in Philadelphia, began her career as a pianist and arranger for the Miami Symphony Orchestra in the 1930's.         In 1965, she was appointed by the Council of Churches of Elmira, N.Y., to serve as one of the first directors of the federally sponsored Head Start program for youngsters. Mrs. Sebner was later hired to organize day-care centers for the Y.W.C.A.-Y.M.C.A. in Manhattan. She retired in 1980.         She is survived by her husband, Emanuel, and a sister, Constance Connors of Bethel Island, Calif.         Correction:  November 12, 1987, Thursday, Late City Final Edition       
        Maria Ivogun, the leading coloratura soprano of German opera in the period between the World Wars, died yesterday. She was 95 years old and lived in Beatenberg, Switzerland.         Maria Ivogun, the leading coloratura soprano of German opera in the period between the World Wars, died yesterday. She was 95 years old and lived in Beatenberg, Switzerland.         The soprano was born Maria Kempner in Budapest on Nov. 18, 1891. Her stage name was a construction based on the name of her mother, Ida von Gunther, a well-known operetta singer.         Ivogun made her debut as Mimi in ''La Boheme'' in 1913, under the direction of Bruno Walter in Munich. She quickly became one of the most popular singers on the German scene, a position she maintained for two decades. Guest appearances took her to the leading opera houses of New York, Chicago, London and Milan. Her artistic home base remained Munich until 1925, when she followed Walter to Berlin.         Her principal roles were Susanna in ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' the Queen of the Night in ''The Magic Flute'' and the leading female parts in ''The Barber of Seville,'' ''Rigoletto,'' ''Don Pasquale'' and other operas. She was the first to sing Zerbinetta in the revised version of Richard Strauss' ''Ariadne auf Naxos.''         In 1921 she married the noted tenor Karl Erb. They were divorced in 1932, and in the next year she married the pianist Michael Raucheisen, who died in 1984.         At the time of her second marriage she retired from singing - still, as her recordings of 1932 demonstrate, at the height of her powers - and began a long and notable career as a teacher. Among her many successful pupils were the sopranos Rita Streich and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. The latter maintained close contact with Ivogun and continued to consult her on pedagogical issues to the end of her life.         Ivogun made about 60 recordings from 1916 to 1932. They show a fresh, silvery voice and a merry style that could be tinged with pathos in melancholy arias. Her version of Zerbinetta's long aria from ''Ariadne'' has long been considered a classic, and her Johann Strauss waltzes sparkled with life.
