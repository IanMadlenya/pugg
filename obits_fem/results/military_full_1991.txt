         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Margaret L. Suckley, an aide and confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and an archivist at the nation's first Presidential Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., died on Saturday at Wilderstein, her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 99 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Miss Suckley, who was known as Daisy, was a distant cousin and close neighbor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and lived her entire life in the landmark house overlooking the Hudson River near Hyde Park built by her grandfather in 1852.         In 1940, Miss Suckley, who raised Scottish terriers, gave the President a puppy he named Fala. The dog soon became the country's most photographed animal. Miss Suckley was the co-author of a children's book about Fala and took part in producing two short films depicting the dog's life in the limelight. Center of Political Uproar         Fala became the center of a political uproar in the 1944 Presidential campaign, when Republicans charged that the Navy had sent a warship to rescue the dog after he had been left behind during a visit by President Roosevelt to the Aleutian Islands. The President turned the story to his advantage by expressing mock indignation that his Republican adversaries would attack "even my little dog Fala."         Miss Suckley was largely invisible to the general public although she traveled with the President on wartime inspection trips and to meetings with heads of state and allied military leaders. She was at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga., when President Roosevelt suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945.         She continued on the staff of the Roosevelt Library until she retired in 1963. She often spoke about the Roosevelt Presidency from her privileged station close to the family but was unassuming and meticulously factual and circumspect in her recollections. Nurse's Aide During War         Miss Suckley was born at Wilderstein and was a descendant of several prominent American families of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Livingstons and Beekmans. She attended Bryn Mawr and during World War I served as a nurse's aide at a military hospital on Ellis Island.         In 1980, she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation, dedicated to the maintenance and public enjoyment of her 45-acre riverfront property whose grounds were designed by Calvert Vaux, the noted 19th century park architect, and whose Queen Anne interiors were the work of J. B. Tiffany. Last year Wilderstein received National Historic Landmark status.         Miss Suckley, the last of seven brothers and sisters, is survived by two nieces, Margaret Hendrick of Annapolis, Md., and Catherine Hambley of Rhinebeck.       
         Florence Cohen, president emeritus of the Volunteers for Israel, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Cohen died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She had been active with the Volunteers of Israel since its founding in 1982. The organization sends volunteers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America to Israel to work in a civilian capacity on military bases and in kibbutzes. It is an offshoot of an 1982 volunteer drive that was established to alleviate shortages created by the war in Lebanon.         Mrs. Cohen, a native of Ramsey, N.J., was a registered nurse who got her nursing degree in 1943. She left nursing to raise a family but returned to the profession in the early 1970's, most recently working at the now defunct Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jules Cohen, a New York cardiologist; two sons, David, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Linda, of Boston, and three grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Cravens, one of the first women to be a news commentator on coast-to-coast radio, died on Thursday at her home in Burkett, Tex. She was 92 years old.         Miss Cravens retired to Burkett in 1962, moving back into the home in which she was born.         She began her career as an actress, playing minor roles in Hollywood silent films, then performing in soap operas and other radio programs in St. Louis. She also started her own program there, "News Through a Woman's Eyes," in 1934, then moved in 1936 to New York, where CBS began to broadcast the show nationwide.         By 1937 she had logged more than 50,000 miles traveling around the country to cover news and had come to be known as the flying commentator. When the program ended in 1938, she wrote columns and features for newspapers, then resumed her program over WNEW in New York in 1941.         In 1945, Miss Cravens became the first woman accredited as a wartime radio correspondent. She was arrested by the Soviet military authorities in Potsdam, Germany, after slipping into the conference site there before Truman, Stalin and Churchill. She went on to travel in 22 countries, filing reports to the Cowles Broadcasting Company and the Mutual Broadcasting System. She interviewed George Bernard Shaw and Pope Pius XII, covered riots in Palestine and helped reunite displaced persons in Europe with their relatives in the United States.         Her one novel, "Pursuit of Gentlemen," was published in 1951.         Surviving are several nieces and nephews.       
         Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells.         Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,         A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate. Calculated Past G.N.P.         After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.         In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.         In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.         Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.  Work in Restaurants         When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.         The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.         She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.         She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.       
         Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.         Mrs. Kriendler was born in New York City and was a graduate of New York University. During World War II she served in a number of executive positions with the Brooklyn chapter of the Motor Transport Service of the American Women's Voluntary Services, the organization that aided the armed forces and local military bases.         She married Mr. Kriendler in 1933, three years after his brother, Jack, founded "21" Club on West 52d Street. Mr. Kriendler was chairman from 1938 to 1989, when he became honorary chairman.         Mrs. Kriendler was a longtime contributor to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera and helped raise funds for them. She also contributed to Cornell University Veterinary School in Ithaca, N.Y.         Besides her husband, there are no immediate survivors.
