         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Patricia Harper, who was among the first women to become a television news anchor, died yesterday in her home in Spain. She was 59.         The cause was a heart attack, said Karen Scott, an executive producer at WPIX-TV in New York City and a longtime friend of Ms. Harper.         Ms. Harper, who grew up in New York, began her career in 1974 as a co-anchor for WPIX, where she won two local Emmy awards.         She went on to become the first female anchor of an independent national news broadcast in 1980 when she anchored "USA Tonight," a syndicated show televised in 200 cities.         "Through her courage and fortitude, she was able to forge ahead in this industry and provide a path for other women to follow," Ms. Scott said. "She was a gutsy lady."         In 1984, Ms. Harper moved to WNBC-TV to co-anchor of the 6 P.M. news with Chuck Scarborough. It was during her tenure that the station won five successive Emmys from 1984 to 1989 for Outstanding Single Newscast.         She won an Emmy herself during that period for a series she reported on the plight of New York City's homeless population.         "She spent many nights on the street with the homeless," Ms. Scott said. "She wanted to get the feel of what they had to go through being homeless on the streets of New York."         Ms. Harper retired from WNBC in 1990 and moved to Capiliera, a city in the Grenada province of Spain.         She is survived by two sons, Arden DeBrun of Tuttle, Okla., and Scott DeBrun of Plano, Tex.; a daughter, Michelle Ogut of Monroe, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Pat Harper, who was among the first women to become a television news anchor, died on Saturday in her home in Capileira, Spain. She was 59.         The cause was a heart attack, said Karen Scott, an executive producer at WPIX in New York City, and a longtime friend.         Ms. Harper, whose full first name was Patricia, grew up in New York and worked at television stations in Philadelphia and Chicago before becoming a co-anchor for WPIX in 1974. She won two local Emmy awards at WPIX. 'USA Tonight' Anchor         She became the first female anchor of an independent national news broadcast in 1980, when she anchored "USA Tonight," a syndicated program televised in 200 cities.         Early in that year, when Ms. Harper was 45, she said in an interview that her age was not a problem in an industry where some believed youth was valued. "When it comes to news, the audience wants credibility," she said, "and I think I have more at my age than people in their 20's."         In 1984, Ms. Harper moved to WNBC to be co-anchor of the 6 P.M. news with Chuck Scarborough. Bud Carey, then the general manager of WNBC, said she brought "a wealth of experience and recognition" to her new role. During her tenure at that station it won five successive Emmy awards from 1984 to 1989.         She won an Emmy herself in that period, for a series she reported on New York City's homeless.         "She spent many nights on the street with the homeless," Ms. Scott said. "She wanted to get the feel of what they had to go through."         Ms. Harper retired from WNBC in 1990 and moved to Capileira, near Grenada in southern Spain.         She is survived by two sons, Arden DeBrun of Tuttle, Okla., and Scott DeBrun of Plano, Tex.; a daughter, Michelle Ogut of Monroe, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Mildred Natwick, a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric, whimsical and spunky characters in plays, films and television for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Miss Natwick, a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner, was a familiar figure on the Broadway stage, where she appeared in some 40 productions. Among other roles, she played an idiosyncratic secretary in George Bernard Shaw's "Candida," an extroverted medium in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and a shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors."         The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson, in his review of the Anouilh play in 1957, characterized her performance as "protean" and one that "rides the whirlwind with a great sweep of venomous extravagance."         Miss Natwick's comic brilliance in Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park" prompted Walter Kerr to acclaim her in 1963 as "the most hilarious woman in the Western hemisphere." She further confirmed her versatility in 1970 in Harold Pinter's "Landscape" and in 1971 when, at the age of 62, she made her debut in a singing role in a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical, "70, Girls, 70," as the disarming leader of a circle of elderly people seeking self-esteem by stealing furs.         Among Miss Natwick's films were four directed by John Ford. She appeared as a prostitute in "The Long Voyage Home," a doomed mother in "The Three Godfathers," a hard-bitten Army wife in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and a sly widow in "The Quiet Man."         In a 1990 interview, she praised Ford as a masterly director who needed just a few words to inspire actors and give them the right clue or insight for a scene. In contrast, she said, Alfred Hitchcock, in directing the comedy "The Trouble With Harry," told her and the other actors precisely what he wanted.         Miss Natwick concentrated her career on Broadway, saying she had always preferred plays to movies because "on the stage, you're in control for two hours, while in a film, you do bits and pieces, usually out of sequence."         She received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work in the 1967 film version of "Barefoot in the Park." She also received several Tony and Emmy nominations and was awarded an Emmy for "The Snoop Sisters," a 1973-74 television series in which she and Helen Hayes played successful mystery writers who were obsessed with solving real crimes.         In an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, she said her main criterion for creating a role was to make a character as inseparable from herself as possible. Nearly everything, she remarked, "is hit or miss for a while, until it all comes together." She said her advice to young performers was: "Act every time you get a chance. At least in the beginning, go wherever acting is."         Miss Natwick, who was called Milly by friends and associates, was born in Baltimore on June 19, 1905, to Joseph Natwick, a businessman, and the former Mildred Marion Dawes. She graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and also from Bennett Junior College in Dutchess County, N.Y., where she majored in drama.         She began performing at the age of 21 with the Vagabonds, a nonprofessional group in Baltimore. She soon joined the celebrated University Players on Cape Cod, trading lines with such other young performers as Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Joshua Logan. She made her Broadway debut in the melodrama "Carry Nation" in 1932.         Among her films were "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945), "The Late George Apley" (1947), "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950), "The Court Jester" (1956), "If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium" (1967), "Daisy Miller" (1974) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988)         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  November 8, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary on Oct. 26 about the actress Mildred Natwick referred incorrectly to her debut in a singing role in a musical. It was in "Stars in Your Eyes" in 1939, not in "70, Girls, 70" in 1971.       
         Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a lawyer who helped reshape the American juvenile justice system, died on Wednesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. She was 91 and lived in nearby Scottsdale.         She had suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis argued a landmark 1967 case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that juveniles charged with criminal offenses were entitled to the same procedural protections in juvenile courts that adults enjoyed in the criminal courts.         The case, In re Gault, dated from 1964, when a 15-year-old boy in Globe, Ariz., was accused of making a lewd telephone call to a woman in his neighborhood. Adjudged a delinquent, he faced detention in a reformatory until he turned 21, punishment that was coincidentally far greater than a similarly charged adult, enjoying greater courtroom protections, would have faced.         Mrs. Lewis took the case after the family of the boy, Gerald Gault, had virtually exhausted its appeals. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Arizona affiliate underwrote the effort, but Mrs. Lewis paid her way to Washington and her expenses there. She later said she had been drawn to the case because "I have raised three healthy sons, and I wanted to give something back."         In its 7-to-2 decision in Gerald's favor, the Supreme Court held that he was entitled to the constitutional safeguards that he had been denied: the right to legal counsel, the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to remain silent.         "Neither the 14th Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults only," Justice Abe Fortas wrote for the majority. "Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court."         Mrs. Lewis was born in the Bronx, received her law degree from St. Lawrence Law School (now Brooklyn Law School) and became one of the few women to be admitted to the New York bar in the early 1920's. She practiced in New York for 33 years and was working in the city's juvenile justice system when her husband, Maxwell Lewis, died in 1957.         She then moved to Arizona, where she took the bar examination with just one other woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, who in 1981 became the first woman on the Supreme Court. Mrs. Lewis continued to practice until two years ago.         She is survived by her three sons, Dr. David Lewis of Linkoping, Sweden, Frank Lewis of Phoenix, and Peter Lewis of Baltimore; a sister, Ernestine D. Hanwell of Atlanta; a brother, Paul Dietrich of Ridge, L.I.; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 8, 1994, Thursday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Nov. 19 about Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a former lawyer, misstated her role in a 1967 Supreme Court case that established that juveniles have essentially the same Constitutional safeguards in criminal proceedings as adults. Mrs. Lewis was co-counsel; Prof. Norman Dorsen of New York University Law School presented oral arguments on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.       
         Viola Spolin, who as a teacher and author was an inspiration for the improvisational theater movement, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Her sister, Beatrice Lees, said Mrs. Spolin had three strokes in recent years.         Through her theater games and her book "Improvisations for the Theater" as well as the subsequent work of her son Paul Sills at the Compass and Second City in Chicago and with Story Theater, Mrs. Spolin influenced several generations of actors and directors, including Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Severn Darden, Barbara Harris, Anthony Holland, Paul Sand and Avery Schreiber. Although she did not have a career as a professional director, her guidance as a vital and highly demonstrative teacher was to indispensable as actors increasingly responded to the idea of improv.         Various comic techniques came later, but she was a primary source of the practical mechanics of theater games, exercises designed to free actors. Explaining her approach, she once said, "My vision is a world of accessible intuition." Mr. Sills said his mother wanted "to help players hit their intuition" and become more spontaneous.         Most of Mrs. Spolin's theater work was with children. She was born in Chicago, where she trained with Neva Boyd, an educator who used games to help children adjust to life in the city. Mrs. Spolin added the idea of theater games, exercises that led to role-playing. Later she worked for the W.P.A. When Mr. Sills joined David Shepherd in creating the Compass improvisational theater, his mother's games became part of the work process.         Since 1945 Mrs. Spolin had lived in Los Angeles, where she founded the Young Actors Company, which is both a school and theater. She retired in 1980. "Improvisations for the Theater," her best-known book (published by Northwestern University Press) remains a standard theatrical text.         In addition to her sister, of New York City, and her son Paul, of Baileys Harbor, Wis., she is survived by her third husband, Robert Kolmus Greene; another son, William Sills of Oakland, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.
