        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations. Actress, Trend-Setter and Author         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips.         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after the end of her career, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned a million dollars a year from films and she was also an author, writing ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' In another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' she dealt with an elaborate miniature doll house she built in the mid-1920's that cost $470,000 and was designed in the form of a castle, complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio. The doll house later was sent around the country for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Michigan on Aug. 19, 1902. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse. 'A New Type Was Born'         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper.         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         In 1937 she married Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, her third husband, and ended her film career. She had previously been married to a film producer, John McCormick, and a New York broker, Albert F. Scott. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children, whom she came to consider her own. He died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daugher, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman, several grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Mrs. Estes was born in West Haven. She graduated from the Pratt Institute Library School and worked as children's librarian in branches of the New York Public Library system.         Her first book was ''The Moffats,'' written in 1941 and an instant hit. It illustrated the life of a family of four children growing up in a small New England town. Two other books about the Moffats followed.         The most popular of her 19 books, many of which she illustrated herself, was ''The Hundred Dresses,'' a tale about a poor child who is ridiculed for her tattered clothing and who insists that she owns 100 dresses. They turn out to be drawings, and when they win a prize, the girl's tormentors are abashed - and perhaps reformed. Won a Newbery Medal         Mrs. Estes won several literary prizes, the most prestigous being a John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished children's book, in 1952 for ''Ginger Pye.''         She was once asked by The New York Times Book Review what she was trying to say to children. She replied: ''I am holding up a mirror, and the scene reflected in the mirror is a true image of childhood, and the mirror, besides reflecting, also speaks and echoes the clear, profound, unpremeditated utterances, thoughts and imageries of children. I like to make children laugh or cry, to be moved in some way by my writing.''         Mrs. Estes wrote a single adult novel, ''The Echoing Green,'' which never achieved the popularity of her children's works.         She is survived by her husband, Rice, and a daughter, Helena Sileo of Brooklyn.       
        Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Dawn made her Broadway stage debut in March 1911 in an imported musical called ''The Pink Lady.'' The show was a hit, running for three years, and although she was not the leading lady Miss Dawn skyrocketed to fame.         She was once the mascot of both Army and Navy at one of their annual football games. And Miss Dawn said that when West Point's cadets tossed their hats onto the stage, one hat belonged to a cadet who later became President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career Began in London         Miss Dawn began her career in London musical comedies and appeared in ''The Dollar Princess'' and ''Dear Little Denmark,'' as well as ''The Pink Lady.'' In New York, Victor Herbert is said to have written ''The Debutant'' for her and she had roles in ''Up in Mabel's Room'' and ''The Demi-Virgin.'' Although she was an exceptional beauty, most of her roles were not starring ones.         Hazel Dawn was born in Ogden, Utah, and named Hazel Tout. Her family later moved to Wales, where her father, a Mormon, was a missionary. In London, according to one version of how she got her name, a producer, Ivan Caryll, met her at a party and said: ''You're just the one I want for my new play. But you must change your name. Tout is honest but impossible. You are so young, so fresh, so pink, you remind one of the dawn; you shall be Hazel Dawn.''         Miss Dawn starred in the original ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and appeared in early silent films of the Famous Players, among whom were Marion Davies and Margaret Clark. Married Into Wealth         In 1927, Miss Dawn married Charles Gruwell, a mining engineer from Montana, reportedly ''one of the richest men in the West,'' and largely gave up her career, though she did appear on stage in ''Wonder Boy'' in 1931. After Mr. Gruwell died in 1941, she went to work in the casting department of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, retiring from there about 25 years ago. She also appeared in 1946 in the film ''Margie.''         Miss Dawn is survived by her daughter, Dawn Gruwell Kaufman, and her son, Charles E. Gruwell, both of New York, five grandsons and seven great-grandchildren.
