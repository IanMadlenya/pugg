         Jacqueline Auriol, the glamorous French flier who set several speed records as one of the world's leading military test pilots in the 1950's and 60's, died Saturday at her Paris home. She was 82.         Ms. Auriol was born to the world of fine boarding schools and country manors and married the son of the man who would become president of France. However, she would eventually transcend her role as the official tea pourer of Elysee Palace to succeed in a field that had been almost entirely masculine, except for Hanna Reitsch of Germany, a test pilot for the Third Reich.         Ms. Auriol's life was transformed when her face was crushed in a 1949 accident in a plane in which she was a passenger. She endured 33 plastic surgery operations over the next three years. (She did not see her two sons, Jean-Claude and Jean-Paul, until her face was as restored as possible. It seemed to work: a newspaper commented that her nose might now be American, but her smile remained unmistakably French.)  Rather than discouraging her, the experience turned her resolve to achieving greatness in the air.         Though she had learned stunt flying before her accident, her goal became nothing less than breaking the sound barrier. She watched the Vampire fighter being built in 1951 and eagerly volunteered to be one of the first to fly it.         ''That day I experienced a sense of completeness,'' she told Collier's magazine, ''an extraordinary sensation of power.''         But she had to settle for being the second woman to break the sound barrier, in 1953. The first was Jacqueline Cochran, an American, earlier that year. The two Jacquelines were to become famous rivals, as each in turn would edge beyond the other in speed.         Jacqueline Douet was born on Nov. 5, 1917, at Challans, a small town on the Bay of Biscay. Her father, Pierre Douet, was a wealthy shipbuilder. She spent most of her childhood at Nantes, then studied art in Paris at L'Ecole du Louvre. On weekends, she would ski in the French Alps.         In 1936, she meet her future husband, Paul Auriol, through a friend who was a ski champion. His father, Vincent, was a prominent leader of the Socialist Party. Both families opposed an alliance between Socialists and wealthy industrialists, so they insisted they were too young to marry. She was sent to Sweden, while Paul toured Italy.         However, two years after their original meeting, they married at a small mountain chapel. They divorced in 1967 and remarried in 1987. She was later widowed. Only her two sons survive her.         When World War II broke out, she refused to leave France while her husband was in the resistance movement. She lived in hiding under a false identity. ''I began to realize that I loved danger,'' she told The Washington Post in 1970.         After the war, her father-in-law became president and she, her husband and Jean-Paul, her older son, moved into Elysee Palace. She soon realized ''the parties and receptions were not enough to keep my interest.'' At dinner one night, she sat next to a flying ace and was so captivated by his stories that she asked if she and her husband could take flying lessons from him.         ''It was very difficult politically for my father-in-law because so few women flew at this time,'' she said.  ''I was pretty and I knew I was pretty. There was publicity and I began to be heavily criticized for my flying.''         The result was that her husband gave up flying, while she dropped out of the social and political life to devote herself to it. Then the accident happened. ''I was broken into a million pieces,'' she said. ''I had no face, no nose, nothing.'' She needed a new purpose in life. ''I had the chance of my life to really become a good pilot,'' she said. ''Now that my beauty was gone I would have to derive a reason for being from the plane which had taken it away.''         As an aviatrix, as Current Biography listed her in its 1950's coverage of her achievements, she succeeded greatly, flying more than 100 types of aircraft. She received aviation awards from Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. She was decorated with France's Legion d'Honneur and wrote an autobiography called ''Vivre pour Voler,'' meaning living for flying. At her death, Jacques Chirac, President of France, called her ''the incarnation of courage and modernity for the French people.''         Her conception of modernity did not include all of feminist philosophy. ''These very feminist women irritate me when they say, 'Men hold me back,' '' she said. ''It's not true.''         But she never undervalued the effect of luck. She had a narrow brush with death in 1956, for example, when her Mystere IV plane went into spin and she managed to bring it back under control only a few dozen yards from the ground.         It was all worth it. In the Colliers interview, she spoke of the rows of flowers on the grounds of Elysee Palace. ''Poor creatures,'' she said, ''guardians and ornaments of the Elysee. Once my life was like theirs.'' She then smiled broadly. ''Perhaps I should teach them to fly,'' she said.       
         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Jean Howard, who rode the comet of her extraordinary beauty, ethereal glamour and insouciant intelligence to become a Ziegfeld girl, a Hollywood starlet, a legendary hostess and the house photographer of the film colony, died at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Monday. She was 89.         Ms. Howard's circle included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle Oberon, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe -- impressive company for the daughter of a traveling salesman. She thrived in a seemingly ancient time when stars socialized for purposes other than publicity, including simply enjoying each other's company.         They played croquet in matches that lasted years (with timeouts for rest, refreshment and the occasional movie), played on California beaches and hung out in Palm Beach, Palm Springs and the south of France. They also mingled at Ms. Howard's Spanish-style home on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills; she and her first husband, Charles K. Feldman, who used his success as the first super-agent to become a producer, bought it for $18,000 in 1942.         Everywhere, Ms. Howard snapped pictures. One shows Gene Tierney, then a top star at 20th Century Fox, in pigtails, looking longingly into the handsome face of the mysterious millionaire Howard Hughes. Another shows a tipsy Richard Burton kissing everyone in sight, including a less-than-charmed Clifton Webb.         Still another shows Dietrich almost touching heads with Ann Warner, wife of Jack, the studio head, as they intensely discussed never-to-be-known secrets over a smoky table at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Linda Christian can be seen being fitted for her wedding gown to marry Tyrone Power.         Many of these photographs were stored in shoe boxes. Meanwhile, Ms. Howard studied photography and began to get assignments taking pictures for magazines like Life and Vogue. Years later, the idea coalesced to combine her snapshots and professional work in a picture book.         In 1989, Harry N. Abrams published ''Jean Howard's Hollywood: A Photo Memoir.'' James Watters wrote the text, which is delivered through Ms. Howard's first-person voice. The book evokes a lost world where stars lived lives that were breathtakingly glamorous, but still somehow life-sized.         In the pictures, everyone, it seems, is smoking. Everyone is holding a drink, everyone is dressed in black tie or cocktail dress. People gather around the piano and sing. Conga lines end up in swimming pools.         ''These photographs bring back memories of a time and a place that have long since faded,'' Ms. Howard wrote in the book's introduction. ''Hollywood has changed and things don't happen as they once did. Never mind. The people who crowd these pages are clear as snowcapped mountains on a bright sunny day.''         Ms. Howard was born Ernestine Hill in Longview, Tex., and grew up in Dallas. She became acquainted with a local photographer, who had discovered several child stars, including Ginger Rogers, and believed she had a bright future. So she changed her last name to that of the photographer, Mahoney, even though her father continued to foot the bills for her fashion shows and beauty contests.         Her father took her to Hollywood one summer in the late 1920's. ''I was his coverup while he was on a two-week toot with a girlfriend behind my stepmother's back,'' she said in the book.         She soon returned to Hollywood and checked into the all-girl Studio Club, founded by Mary Pickford to help young hopefuls working toward movie careers. In 1930 she landed a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer, appearing first as a chorus girl in ''Whoopee,'' Eddie Cantor's Broadway musical hit.         Florenz Ziegfeld, who had produced the Broadway show and was a partner in the film, asked her and three other showgirls to go to New York for his next musical, ''Smiles.'' Ziegfeld cast her under the name Jean Howard, which he deemed less cumbersome than Ernestine Mahoney. She got a part in the last ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' where one review cited her ''pulchritude, figure and charm.''         As an MGM contract player she had small roles in a number of movies in the 1930's and 1940's, including ''Broadway to Hollywood'' and ''The Prizefighter and the Lady.'' The studio chief Louis B. Mayer, passionately attracted to her, proposed marriage and promised to divorce his wife. She said later that when she rejected him he got drunk and tried to throw himself out of a window.         She became engaged to Feldman, a lawyer and film agent, who is credited with being the first to sell director, actors and other talent as a single package. According to The New York Times of Aug. 26, 1934, the two had attended a Friday night dinner party at the Colony restaurant in New York and decided to get married immediately.         Mayer's jealous threat to torpedo Feldman's career did not materialize, and the agent went on to play an increasingly prominent role in Hollywood, eventually producing ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' in 1951, among other films.         The couple had a famously tempestuous relationship, which resulted in a divorce in 1948. But they continued living in the same house, with its tortoise shell pedestals and Chinese porcelain lamps and a garden room where Judy Garland belted out songs on many occasions. They called it their ''can't live with you, can't live without you postmarital relationship.''         In a 1989 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Ms. Howard said she ''wanted to be the other woman in his life.''         Ms. Howard traveled extensively, often with her friend Cole Porter. That resulted in another picture book, ''Travels With Cole Porter,'' published in 1991.         In 1964, she felt seasick on a Mediterranean cruise and got off the yacht in Capri. She went to a nightclub called Number Two, where a band called the Shakers was playing. She asked a band member, Tony Santoro, if he would play a song she had written. He did, though not necessarily because of its quality.         ''I was more interested in this beautiful woman than the music,'' he said in a telephone interview. They lived together for nine years, mainly in Capri and Rome, and were married in 1973. He is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Howard once said that ''glamour is flimsy.'' She knew the stars as people, including one of her favorite subjects, Marilyn Monroe. ''She didn't know who she was or who she belonged to,'' Ms. Howard told the San Diego paper. ''The marriages never gave her anything to go on. There was the ballplayer (Joe DiMaggio) and Arthur Miller.         ''Miller was a very good writer and all of that, but I have never seen him in anybody's living room, and I have been in a few living rooms.''         Then there was the party she gave for Senator John F. Kennedy during the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, at which he won his party's nomination. After everyone had left and she was cleaning up, she heard someone scratching at the window screen, according to a 1993 article in Town & Country.         She looked out and saw Kennedy, who said, ''I'm starving and nothing's open at this hour.'' She led him to the kitchen and fed him scrambled eggs. She said the senator then pulled her to him and kissed her. She told the magazine that people would have to read her autobiography to find out what happened.         But she never published one.       
         Hannah Komanoff, the first woman elected to the Board of Supervisors in Nassau County, N.Y., died on Sunday at a hospital in Long Beach, on Long Island. She was 89.         Mrs. Komanoff, a Democrat, was elected to the board from Long Beach, where she lived much of her life, in 1973, and served three terms from 1974 to 1985.         She opposed nuclear power development on Long Island and a proposed bridge across Long Island Sound from Oyster Bay to Rye. She was also a trustee and president of the Long Beach Board of Education from 1957 to 1973.         Mrs. Komanoff, who lived in Lido Beach, N.Y., for the last 11 years, was born in the Bronx on July 28, 1910, and graduated from New York University in 1931.         She moved to to Long Beach in the 1940's.         Her husband, Isidore Komanoff, died in 1985. She is survived by two daughters, Frederica Miceli of Manhattan and Ruth Underwood of Studio City, Calif.; a son, Charles Komanoff of Manhattan; a brother, Stanley Winters of Port Charlotte, Fla.; and five grandchildren.         Correction:  April 18, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Hannah Komanoff, the first woman elected to the Board of Supervisors in Nassau County, N.Y., misstated the date of her death. It was April 9, not last Sunday.       
         Jane Trahey, one of the most prominent advertising women of the 1960's, who was best known for Blackglama's ''What Becomes a Legend Most?'' campaign, died of cancer Saturday at her home in Kent, Conn. She was 76.         Known as a brilliant copywriter, Ms. Trahey was also credited with catchy slogans for Dynel, Union Carbide's synthetic hair (''It's not fake anything. It's real Dynel.''), Danskin Inc. (''Danskins Are Not Just for Dancing.'') and Echo Scarves (''The Echo of an Interesting Woman.'').         Among her other clients were Elizabeth Arden, Bill Blass, Olivetti typewriters, Hamilton watches, Pauline Trigere fashions and Ebony magazine. She also created public service advertising for the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, for which she served as vice president and member of the board. Ms. Trahey  was named Advertising Woman of the Year in 1969 by the American Advertising Federation.         Ms. Trahey founded Trahey Advertising Inc. in New York in 1960. The name was changed in 1966 to Trahey/Wolf after she formed a partnership with Henry Wolf, the photographer and art director. After Mr. Wolf left in the early 1970's to open his own production company,  Ms. Trahey then took as a partner Peter Rogers, who had been working for her as an account executive and de facto office manager.         She and Mr. Rogers worked together on the Blackglama ads starting in 1968. The ads in the early years featured celebrities like Barbra Streisand, Lauren Bacall and Maria Callas swathed in mink, with the catch phrase ''What becomes a legend most?'' The celebrities were considered so glamorous that they were never identified by name. The ads continued to be produced by Mr. Rogers after Ms. Trahey gave up the agency business in the mid-1970's. The last ad, featuring Tommy Tune, ran in 1996, making it one of Madison Avenue's longest-running campaigns.         Ms. Trahey was too creative to worry about the details of running a business, recalled Rocky Piliero, who worked as production manager of her agency starting in 1969 and is still working with Mr. Rogers. ''It was a very informal company, like a playground,'' Mr. Piliero said yesterday. ''Ms. Trahey didn't like accounts. She liked projects. She liked to do something new. She'd be gung-ho for six months, then get bored.''         To keep her fertile mind active, Ms. Trahey also gave lectures to professional women's organizations and wrote scores of magazine articles, novels, humorous pamphlets, a play and a self-help book called ''Jane Trahey on Women & Power: Who's Got It. How to Get It.''         Her play, ''Ring Round the Bathtub,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1972 and starred Elizabeth Ashley, was a sentimental look at an American family in Chicago, her hometown, during the Depression. She also wrote of her youthful experiences in ''Life With Mother Superior,'' a novel that was made into a film called ''The Trouble with Angels'' starring Rosalind Russell and Hayley Mills.         Her other books included ''Thursdays Till Nine,'' a humorous novel about a fictional Texas department store inspired by an early job at Neiman Marcus, and ''Pecked to Death by Goslings,'' based on her experiences converting a Connecticut barn into a home.         She called the converted barn Versailles, she said in a 1964 article in The New York Times, ''not because it looks like it, but because it costs as much.'' She later sold that house.         Ms. Trahey's first job was at The Chicago Tribune in the clippings library, known as the morgue. ''My mother never got over it,'' Ms. Trahey recalled years later. ''Every time she would call and someone would answer ''the morgue'' she'd cross herself and hang up.''         Her entry into advertising came at the Carson Pirie Scott department store in Chicago. In 1947 she went to Dallas as advertising director of Neiman Marcus, rising to become sales promotion director before leaving for New York to start her own agency.         After leaving the agency in the 1970's, she divided her time for many years between Chicago and New York, working as a consultant, before settling in Connecticut two years ago with Jacqueline Babbin, a friend for 40 years. But wherever she lived, Ms. Trahey never stopped writing or lecturing and could occasionally be cajoled into taking on a challenging project, as she did in 1981 for Joe Famolare, who had been making thick-soled shoes and fashionable clogs since 1970. When fashions changed, Mr. Famolare called on Ms. Trahey, who put his picture in the ads and turned him into a celebrity.         Ms. Trahey is survived by her sister, Anita Richter, and a niece, Kristina Richter Becker, both of Englewood, N.J.       
         Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning Hollywood beauty of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.         Miss Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in ''The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on ''The Loretta Young Show.'' She retired almost 40 years ago and never returned to the big screen.         Miss Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years. The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.         Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ''The Primrose Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon Chaney in ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.         Her movies included ''Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ''Zoo in Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ''Man's Castle'' with Tracy, also in 1933; ''Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ''The Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and ''The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.         Miss Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise, sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to having had ''crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being ''susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished autobiography:         ''My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries -- that would have been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women out there who were like me -- who were willing to play by the rules, didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband, nice lover, no abuse of any kind -- that's what the heroes and heroines were in those days.''         While Miss Young said she considered herself more of a ''movie star'' than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the ''first lady'' of dramatic television, with ''The Loretta Young Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961, Miss Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous entrance.         ''I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Miss Young said in a 1995 interview. ''I initially just walked through the doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful back of the dress.''         So Miss Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward the camera. Viewers loved it.         The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and a formidable rival. Miss Young said friends and advisers warned her that if she appeared on television regularly she would be ''blackballed out of this business'' and ''never get another job.'' But she saw television as the ''wave of the future,'' and signed a contract with NBC and Procter & Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic series.         Miss Young appeared in 165 episodes. A devout Catholic, she ended each show by delivering a homily to the audience. Her show extolled ''respect for law and order and for disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said in her 1961 memoir, ''The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with Helen Ferguson. ''Above all, we want to prove the strength, the good, really, of people.''         Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ''Sunday night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on television, earning Miss Young millions of dollars and a reputation as one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.         In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the network had humiliated her through the overseas release of introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in outmoded gowns and hairstyles.         She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ''The New Loretta Young Show'' and ran for a year.         In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began reruns of the original show, the rights to which Miss Young had turned over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are film producers.         Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ''Uncommon Knowledge,'' that she was the daughter of Miss Young and Clark Gable and that she was conceived during the making of ''Call of the Wild,'' in which the two starred.         In 1935 when the film was made, Miss Young was single and Gable was married to Ria Langham. Miss Lewis said that Miss Young was terrified that a scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and citing an unspecified illness. Later, Miss Lewis asserted, Miss Young arranged her ''adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where she had been temporarily placed.         For years, Miss Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's account, dismissing it as ''a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for months.         Mr. Brokaw said yesterday, ''She didn't want to ever publicly acknowledge it.''         Miss Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated, and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop, persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit and opened a boardinghouse.         Miss Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann and Betty Jane.         First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.         In 1930, at 17, Miss Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in the film ''The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H. A. Lewis, an advertising executive who later became a producer of her television series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons, Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.         Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Miss Young was among the first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox to try working as a freelance actress, she was blackballed by the studios. She made only one film, ''Eternally Yours,'' with David Niven, during the next two years.         She owned the rights to ''The Loretta Young Show'' and had control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid strict attention to the show's moral tone.         During the filming for one episode, ''Come to the Stable,'' about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a hospital for children, Miss Young became so disturbed by swearing on the set that she came up with the idea of a ''swear box.'' Cast and crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.         In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way, Miss Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts, her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in ''Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.         She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to promote one of her favorite charities. Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994. Mr. Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ''The Solid Gold Cadillac.''         Mr. Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Montalban, Miss Young is survived by her three children.         Miss Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote: ''I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put here to do, we will be prepared -- mentally, spiritually and physically -- for our separation from this world.''

         Helen Quinn, who for more than 30 years presided firmly over the Metropolitan Opera patrons who lined up every Saturday morning to buy standing-room tickets for the next  week's performances, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was food poisoning, said  Josephine Rowe, a friend.         Often called the Queen of Standees by the hundreds of people who compliantly allowed her to take charge of the ticket queue, Ms. Quinn was a herself a veteran of standing-room lines at the Met. In 1943, having just finished high school in Manhattan, she attended a performance of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' at the Met and was instantly hooked on opera. Soon she was attending five or six performances a week, almost always as a standee.         In 1966, on her own initiative, she more or less imposed a system on the standee process that the throng of regulars was apparently happy to abide by. Standing-room tickets for the week go on sale at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Under Ms. Quinn's system, as opera buffs arrived, many as early as 4 or 5 a.m., they wrote their names on a numbered list on her clipboard, then went home or to a coffee shop across the street, leaving Ms. Quinn to wait in their place.         Around 9 a.m., the expectant standing-room ticket buyers would return, and Ms. Quinn began barking commands with a vocal power that many a hefty dramatic soprano would covet. Happy that someone was in charge, the opera buffs complied. Ms. Quinn tolerated no dissent, even from the Luciano Pavarotti fans, who tended, she said in a 1994 interview in The New York Times, to be the most pushy.         ''The Pavarotti people can be a little ferocious,'' she said. ''If I had to live with a group of people the rest of my life, I would pick the Wagnerites. They're the most patient. Domingo people are a close second. The Pavarotti people are at the bottom of the list. I don't mix with them personally. They're loud in their deportment, they talk among themselves and they want extra places for their friends.''         Cutting ahead in the line was absolutely verboten, as Wotan would put it. ''When I see someone crashing the line,'' Ms. Quinn was quoted as saying, ''I pounce.'' Her tactic was to expose the intruder to the orderly faithful. ''Believe me, it works,'' she said. ''It's the most humiliating experience for anyone.''         Ms. Quinn, who was born in New Jersey on April 15, 1924, was rather circumspect about her private life. At 14 her family moved to New York City. After graduating from high school, she took her first job as a key-punch operator for Columbia Pictures. In the early 1960's, when she heard that a new Metropolitan Opera House would be built, she moved to  an apartment on West 57th Street to be close. She lived there until her death. She is survived by a sister, Jean Magrow of Oceanside, N.J.         After Ms. Quinn had for some time been running the standing-room line,  a procedure to which the Met gave tacit approval, some regular standees urged her to begin collecting tips for her efforts. She decided to do so.         ''I figured that running the line was my contribution to the Met,'' she said. ''But people kept saying to me:  'Helen, wise up. You're performing a public service.'' ' Most patrons offered her a dollar as they turned in their slips, but those who did not  received the same consideration.         Ms. Rowe, who has been Ms. Quinn's partner in running the standing-room line since 1995, said she planned to continue the work alone.       
         Jean Peters, a 20th Century Fox contract player whose unpretentious beauty earned her leading roles in some of the top films of the late 1940's and early 50's before she abandoned her career and practically disappeared from view after a secretive marriage to the billionaire Howard Hughes, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Carlsbad, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Peters, who was known as  Pete during her acting years, was a lead actress from the moment she arrived in Hollywood at the age of 21 after winning a Miss Ohio State beauty contest whose prizes included a Fox screen test.         The studio quickly offered her a seven-year contract. Within months of being driven cross-country by her widowed mother, the owner of a tourist camp outside their hometown, Canton, Ms. Peters was chosen as the female lead in the lavish epic ''Captain from Castille,'' opposite Tyrone Power.         Though never considered one of Hollywood's great actresses, the green-eyed, fresh-faced Ms. Peters had a straightforward naturalness on camera that made her a favorite leading lady of some of the top stars of the period.         She appeared with Ray Milland in the baseball comedy ''It Happens Every Spring'' (1949), and with Marlon Brando in Elia Kazan's ''Viva Zapata!'' (1952), Richard Widmark in Sam Fuller's ''Pickup on South Street'' (1953), Joseph Cotten and Marilyn Monroe in ''Niagara'' (1953), Spencer Tracy in ''Broken Lance'' (1954), Burt Lancaster in ''Apache'' (1954) and, perhaps most memorably, as one of three American women in Rome in Jean Negulesco's ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954).         Many remarked at the time on Ms. Peters's informal off-camera style,  avoiding Hollywood night life and the networking scene in the studio commissary for private picnics with her hairdresser and makeup artist on the floor of a dark set.         She was most often seen without makeup and wearing jeans and simple shirts. She lived in a rented bungalow decorated with watercolors she had painted herself. The studio publicity machine painted her as an Ohio farm girl and a bit of a tomboy baseball fan, an image that was difficult to reconcile with the sculptured beauty who appeared on the screen.         ''Back home, I still have 3 dogs, 18 cats, a goat named Josephine and a lamb called Ali Baba,'' she told an interviewer in 1948.         To another, in 1949, she remarked: ''I don't like servants or big houses, and I'd hate to waste my time playing bridge in the afternoons. I think women need to cook and sew.''         Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, Ms. Peters met and began a quiet relationship with the reclusive Hughes -- also famous for his ostentatiously unpretentious wardrobe -- and for a decade the couple dated, usually getting together once a week, often to watch movies until late into the evening in one of Hughes's screening rooms. Among his holdings at the time were RKO Studios, Trans World Airlines, Hughes Aircraft and the Hughes Tool Company.         She was rarely seen in public and never in the company of another man, though Hughes was often seen on the town with some of the top actresses of the day. Because of the long nature of their relationship, there were frequent rumors that the couple had secretly wed.         For a few months, in 1954, Ms. Peters was married to Stanley W. Cramer 3rd, a Texas oil executive, but it ended in divorce and, like all of her marriages, without children. It was in 1957 that another rumor arose of a secret wedding between Hughes and Ms. Peters. This time it was true. The couple had married in a private ceremony in Tonapah, Nev.         Ms. Peters, whose final movie was ''A Man Called Peter'' (1955), retired from film acting and was rarely seen in public during the 13 years she remained married to Hughes. Neither granted interviews.         Over the years, Ms. Peters established herself in a remote, hilltop mansion in Bel Air while her husband, growing ever more reclusive and secretive, adjourned to the penthouses above a Las Vegas casino where he passed most of the last decades of his life.         They would still get together once a week or so, usually watching movies in Hughes's sanctuary.         An acquaintance, D. L. Lyons, a writer for The Ladies' Home Journal, described Ms. Peters's cloistered life in the late 1960's when he tried to visit her. ''At that time, in 1968, very much married to Howard, she lived in splendid solitude on Bel Air Road, atop a peak of the Santa Monica Mountains, under 24-hour surveillance of guards who followed her everywhere,'' he wrote.         By 1970, with her marriage disintegrating, Ms. Peters moved to a smaller house in Beverly Hills, let the guards go and even began to appear in public, attending movie screenings and going to restaurants.         Shortly after her divorce became final in 1971 she was married for a third time, to Stanley Hough, vice president and director for production operations at 20th Century Fox. Mr. Hough died in 1996, and Ms. Peters  moved to be closer to her sister in Carlsbad, a suburb of San Diego.         According to reports at the time of her divorce from Hughes, Ms. Peters had agreed as part of the settlement not to discuss their private life together and not to return to movies, at least as long as the billionaire was alive.         In 1976, though, shortly after his death, Ms. Peters made her first screen appearances in two decades, playing roles in a television mini-series, ''Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers,'' and in a public television production of ''Winesburg, Ohio.''         In 1981 she had a role in another television film, ''Peter and Paul.''  After that, she made only rare guest appearances on television series like ''Murder, She Wrote.''         A friend, Arlen Hurwitz, once recalled how Ms. Peters reacted to the attention of fans during the height of her career in the late 1940's. ''Whenever fans stop Jean on our wanderings, she has her own patented way of handling them,'' Ms. Hurwitz said.         ''They say, 'Are you Jean Peters?' and she frowns and asks in a puzzled voice, 'Who is Jean Peters?' It always works. They go off looking bewildered and we go on about our business.''       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Jacquelyn Reinach, a writer, composer, television producer and co-creator of the ''Sweet Pickles'' series of children's books, which featured characters like Accusing Alligator and Smarty Stork, died on Sept. 30 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son Barron. A former smoker, she had produced anti-tobacco programs for the American Cancer Society and other groups.         Although Ms. Reinach wrote more than 50 books and 600 songs, several musical shows and educational productions and contributed to Shari Lewis's television series ''Lamb Chop Play Along'' on PBS, she was best known for the ''Sweet Pickles'' books first published in 1976.         The series, which she created with Richard Hefter, a writer and illustrator, and Ruth Lerner Perle, based on a menagerie of alphabetical animals with gentle foibles, sold more than 50 million copies. It also secured her a substantial fortune as the books and marketing tie-ins went on to generate more than $200 million in worldwide sales. The books, which went out of print in the mid-1990's, are now traded regularly on eBay and may be revived under a new publishing contract, Mr. Hefter said.         Mr. Hefter said the phenomenon began with the notion of ''a peer group with no authority figures.''         ''There'd be no parents, no family, just alphabetic characters equally divided between male and female,'' he said. ''Because Jackie was a psychologist by training, each character was given a specific personality trait.''         ''The behaviors were never corrected,'' he added. ''Goof-Off Goose always goofs off, and others learn to accept it. Accusing Alligator learns a lesson but remains the same. They're all lovable in their foibles, and none are menacing.''         Ms. Reinach came up with the series title to suggest that life's problems were resolvable pickles, Mr. Hefter said. ''Holt, Reinhart hated the name, so we kept it,'' he said. The publisher sold 10 million copies, and the Weekly Reader Book Club, owned by Xerox, sold 40 million more.         The first 26 books used characters going through the alphabet -- Bashful Bear, Clever Camel, all the way to Zany Zebra -- but when a demanding public clamored for more, the partners made up 14 new stories with the same cast.         Jacquelyn Krasne Reinach was born in Omaha, grew up in Beverly Hills and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles before moving to New York. She wrote scripts for the Fran Allison ''Learn at Home'' television series and worked with Shari Lewis on a series of ''Headstart'' books for McGraw-Hill. She won an Emmy in 1993 for a young people's anti-smoking program, ''Know the Facts: Keep Your Power,'' and wrote and produced a traveling school program for the American Heart Association.         In 1966 she was the organizing force behind an effort by Upper East Side parents to occupy their restless sons on weekends. Called Operation Saturday, it shuttled the boys from sports fields to airport freight hangars and magazine photo labs.         Among her 600 songs was ''Liberation, Now!'' which became the feminist anthem of the Women's Strike for Peace in 1970. (That year she also wrote a 300-recipe feminist cookbook: ''How to Enjoy the Leisure Life in a Beach House, Mountain Cabin, Lake Shack, Ski Chalet, Trailer, Country Home or City Apartment.'') Another song, ''The Family,'' became the theme of the United Nations' Year of the Family in 1994.         Her shows included ''Love Is Spoken Here,'' written with Stanley Ralph Ross and staged at the Maine State Music Theater.         Ms. Reinach's first three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son Barron, of Manhattan, she is survived by her fourth husband, Dion Neutra, an architect and the son and partner of the modernist architect Richard Neutra, whom she married this year; another son, Alan, of Fillmore, Calif.; a brother, Donald Krasne of Beverly Hills; and her mother, Dorothy Krasne of Los Angeles.         In her final months Ms. Reinach kept up a busy schedule and signed a contract to publish three new children's books. ''She had 25 years of things to do,'' said her son Barron. The first new book is to be published this spring: ''Mr. Raccoon, Where's Your Spoon?''       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.

         Sybil H. Milton, a leading scholar of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and a senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, died on Oct. 16 in the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. She was 59.         Dr. Milton, who lived in Chevy Chase, Md., died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, Henry Friedlander, a professor of history at the City University of New York and president of the German Studies Association.         She taught German history at Stanford University and elsewhere before becoming director of archives at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York from 1974 to 1984. Afterward, she was a consultant to the Holocaust Memorial Council.         At the time of her death, Dr. Milton was vice president of the Swiss-appointed Independent Commission of Experts, which was investigating Swiss policies toward Jews and Nazis during the Holocaust.         Last December, the commission issued a report condemning Switzerland's restrictive policies toward Jewish immigration during the war years when European Jews were seeking refuge from Nazi genocide.         Dr. Milton, who represented the United States on the commission, studied Swiss banks and the Nazi handling of Jewish-owned assets, precious metals and works of art.         Menachem Z. Rosensaft, a member of the executive committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which oversees the Washington museum, and who knew of Dr. Milton through her work there, said she was a pioneer in studying the memorials and archives of the Nazi death camps throughout Europe.         During a long hospitalization, Dr. Milton continued work on her latest book, ''The Camera as Weapon and Voyeur: Photography of the Holocaust as Memorial Evidence,'' which Dr. Friedlander said he plans to complete.         Sybil Halpern was born on Oct. 6, 1941, in New York City to Jewish parents who had fled Austria when the Nazis came to power.         After graduating from the High School of Music and Art, she received a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1962, a master's the next year and a doctorate from Stanford University in modern German history in 1971.         Dr. Milton's marriage to Daniel Milton ended in divorce. She is survived by Professor Friedlander.       
         Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the first woman in the world to serve as a prime minister, died yesterday shortly after voting in Sri Lanka's elections. She was 84.         Mrs. Bandaranaike's final act was to vote in a parliamentary election she hoped would return the family's party to power leading a governing coalition known as the People's Alliance. Her death from a heart attack on Election Day seemed poetically timed for a woman whose family business is politics and whose political career spanned four decades.         Mrs. Bandaranaike rose to power in 1960 as a bereaved wife and mother of three, just a year after her husband, Solomon, then prime minister, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk. She quickly established herself as the undisputed leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -- founded by her husband -- and a formidable politician in her own right.         She also became the matriarch of a political dynasty. In the final years of her life, her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, succeeded her as the standard bearer of the family party and has served as president of the country since 1994. The father, mother and daughter have led Sri Lanka for 21 of the 52 years since it gained its independence from the British.         ''Mrs. Bandaranaike's legacy is this: After her husband died, there was so much confusion and the party was almost collapsing,'' said K. M. de Silva, a Sri Lankan historian. ''She was an untried leader. But she not only survived, she sustained the party and the family in politics.''         Her body was taken to her stately  home on Rosemead Place in the Cinnamon Gardens section of Colombo, the capital. State radio canceled regular programs to play elegiac music and state television looked back on her life.         She will be buried alongside her husband on Saturday in a state funeral at the family's ancestral home in Horagulla. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of national mourning. All liquor shops, bars, cinemas and slaughterhouses have been ordered to close.         ''She was a heroic mother of the nation,'' the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said in a statement.         But the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has come to stand for very different policies and values than it had in her day.         Mrs. Kumaratunga firmly repudiated her mother's brand of Sinhalese nationalism, which had inflamed ethnic tensions between the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil minority. The daughter's years in office have been dominated by her as-yet-fruitless efforts to end a 17-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels. Mrs. Kumaratunga also steered the party toward a more open, market-oriented economy and away from the centralized, state-dominated socialism that had been her mother's trademark.         Mrs. Bandaranaike was born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the island nation's wealthy feudal families, one that was at the pinnacle of Sri Lanka's social hierarchy. In 1940 -- 60 years ago today -- she married S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the scion of an elite, feudal clan that had thrived for generations with the patronage of the British Empire.         Mr. Bandaranaike made the transition from his Anglicized, upper-class background to become a populist and a nationalist. And his wife carried forward his passions with even greater decisiveness and vigor,  historians say. She was a shrewd political leader with a wide base in the Sinhalese majority.         In a recent interview, Anura, the Bandaranaike's youngest child and only son, said their father had been the affectionate, demonstrative parent while their mother was aloof.         Mrs. Bandaranaike -- known simply as Mrs. B -- served twice as  head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977. She nationalized many foreign and local enterprises and left Sri Lanka's economy into one that was heavily state dominated.         She also zealously pursued efforts to make Sinhalese the sole national language, a stance that deeply alienated the country's Tamil speakers. And she changed the university admissions policy to benefit the Sinhalese, disadvantaging the Tamils.         During five years of her daughter's presidency, Mrs. Bandaranaike served as prime minister, which had become a largely ceremonial role under the Constitution adopted in 1978. Increasingly feeble and unable to speak clearly, she resigned as prime minister in August, though she retained her seat in Parliament.         She lived on Rosemead Place with her elder daughter, Sunethra, a philanthropist who is 57 and never got involved in politics.         But the political family she had nurtured splintered in her later years. Her son, Anura, 51, who lives  next to his mother's home in the family compound, went over to the family's despised rival, the United National Party, after his sister, now 55, won the right to succeed their mother. But both the son, as a leader of the opposition, and the daughter, as president, have carried on the family's political tradition.       
         Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         ''I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street,'' Ms. Brooks once said. ''I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.''         In Ms. Brooks's early poetry, Chicago's vast black South Side is called Bronzeville. It was ''A Street in Bronzeville,'' her first poetry anthology, that attracted the attention of the literary establishment in 1945.         The Bronzeville poems were recommended to the editors of Harper & Row by Richard Wright, who admired her ability to capture ''the pathos of petty destinies, the whimper of the wounded, the tiny incidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problems of common prejudice.''         But it was more than Ms. Brooks's ability to write about struggling black people, particularly black women. There was also her mastery of the language of poetry.         ''Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere rhythms,'' the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the poems in ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' Calling her ''a real poet,'' Mr. Humphries said of her technique, ''There is a range of form: quatrains, free verse, ballads, sonnets -- all appropriately controlled.''         Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of ''Bronzeville'' in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more ''Negro poetry'' than Robert Frost's poetry was ''white poetry.''         Among the poems in ''Bronzeville' was ''the old-marrieds,'' a portrait of an aging couple:         But in the crowding darkness not a word did they say.         Though the pretty-coated birds had piped so lightly all         the day.         And he had seen the lovers in the little side-streets.         And she had heard the morning stories clogged with         sweets.         It was quite a time for loving. It was midnight. It was         May.         But in the crowded darkness not a word did they say.         In ''A Street in Bronzeville'' Ms. Brooks created such indelible figures as the old, alienated Matthew Cole, who could only smile at such memories as ''say, thoughts of a little boy licorice-full/Without a nickel for Sunday School,'' and Satin Legs Smith, awakening on a Sunday:         He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.         And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the         Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.         In 1946 and 1947, Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1949, she published her second volume of verse, ''Annie Allen,'' a portrait of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an experimental form she called the sonnet-ballad. ''Full of insight and wisdom and pity, technically dazzling,'' Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book Review.         ''Annie Allen'' won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949 and the following year, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in 1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.         ''That's why I am as well known as I am today,'' she said in a 1987 interview. ''Sometimes,'' she added with a smile, ''I feel that my name is Gwendolyn Pulitzer Brooks.''         Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, ''Maud Martha,'' which received scant consideration when it was published in 1953. ''Maud Martha'' traced the life of a Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity and motherhood through a series of 34 vignettes.         The reader meets Maud as a lonely, overweight girl of 7, follows her through a dreamy adolescence and finally sees her as a young newlywed living ''in a sad gray building in a cold white world,'' married to a man numbed by his struggle with white society.         But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and invidiously compared with Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In recent years, however, ''Maud Martha'' has had a rebirth, and it is now regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent themes in the works of today's female writers.         ''Bronzeville Boys and Girls,'' a collection of children's poetry, appeared in 1956, followed by two poetry collections, ''The Bean Eaters'' (1960) and ''Selected Poems'' (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the racial tensions in Little Rock in 1957.         They also noticed -- and most applauded -- a sharper colloquial style that was emerging in poems like ''We Real Cool'' from ''The Bean Eaters'':         We real cool. We         Left school. We         Lurk Late. We         Strike straight. We         Sing sin. We         Thin gin. We         Jazz June. We         Die soon.         By the early 1960's, Ms. Brooks had reached a high point in her writing career. She was regarded as a grande dame of America's black writers and an honored member of the literary elite, a sought-after teacher, a poet who was valued for her sensitive portraits of black women, her precise use of language and the universality of her work. But by the end of the decade she had transformed herself and her poetry -- a reflection of the new political dynamics that were sweeping across all the Bronzevilles of America.         Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., on June 7, 1917, but grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where she remained till she died. Her parents, David Anderson Brooks and the former Keziah Corinne Wims, encouraged her and her younger brother, Raymond, to read and take an interest in culture from an early age.         Gwendolyn began writing poetry before she was a teenager, filling composition books with ''careful rhymes'' and ''lofty meditations.'' Her mother was an enthusiastic supporter, often telling her, ''You are going to be the lady Paul Laurence Dunbar.'' Ms. Brooks published her first poem, ''Eventide,'' in American Childhood when she was 13.         Prompted by her mother, the teenager sent her poems to Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson. Mr. Hughes, who would become her friend and longtime supporter, wrote back: ''You have talent. Keep writing! You'll have a book published one day.'' Mr. Johnson also responded with encouragement, urging her to read such modern poets as Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings and T. S. Eliot. By the age of 16, Ms. Brooks had become a regular contributor to the ''Lights and Shadows'' column of The Chicago Defender, where many of her earliest poems appeared.         Three years after her graduation from the newly opened Woodrow Wilson Junior College in Chicago in 1936, Ms. Brooks married Henry L. Blakely, a young writer who later published a volume of his own poetry. They lived in Chicago for the next 30 years, divorced in 1969 but reunited in 1973. Her survivors include a daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely, and a son, Henry Blakely.         Ms. Brooks's poetry shifted noticeably in form and concern after she attended a conference of black writers at Fisk University in the spring of 1967. While there she listened to readings by Amiri Baraka, Ron Milner and other young firebrand poets. ''I felt that something new was happening,'' she later said.         Those young black writers ''seemed so proud and committed to their own people,'' she added. ''The poets among them felt that black poets should write as blacks, about blacks, and address themselves to blacks.''         She later wrote: ''If it hadn't been for these young people, these young writers who influenced me, I wouldn't know what I know about this society. By associating with them I know who I am.''         Returning to Chicago, she began a poetry workshop in her home that included members of a Chicago street gang called the Blackstone Rangers and younger poets like Sonia Sanchez, Don L. Lee and Nikki Giovanni. Much of the talk was devoted to ways of merging the concept of black art with the political concept of black power.         These currents were evident in Ms. Brooks's next volume of poetry, ''In the Mecca'' (Harper 1968). The 30-page title poem described a mother's frantic search for her missing daughter in a sprawling, decrepit building called the Mecca, which once was one of Chicago's fanciest apartment houses.         In a volume that was described by one critic as ''her declaration of independence'' from the integrationist pursuit that had previously shaped her work, Ms. Brooks wrote about the desperate and tragic lives of the inhabitants of the Mecca. She wrote from experience. Ms. Brooks worked at the real Mecca as a typist for a ''spiritual adviser'' when she was young and got to know the people in the building.         The collection also offered poems about Malcolm X and the Blackstone Rangers:         Black, raw, ready.         Sores in the city         That do not want to heal.         Ms. Brooks used clipped lines, abstract word patterns and random rhymes to capture her new radical tone and her more direct expression of social concern.         ''In the Mecca'' was nominated for a National Book Award.         Asked if the change in work signaled her emergence as a ''protest poet,'' Ms. Brooks said, ''No matter what the theme is, I still want the poem to be a poem, not just a piece of propaganda.'' Ms. Brooks reflected the change in her 1988 poem ''Winnie'':         I am tired of little tight-fisted poems sitting down to         shape perfect unimportant pieces.         Poems that cough lightly -- catch a sneeze.         This is the time for Big Poems         roaring up out of the sleaze,         poems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.         After the publication of ''In the Mecca'' Ms. Brooks left her longtime mainstream publisher, Harper & Row. ''Rio'' (1969), her next volume of poetry, was published by Broadside Press, a small, Detroit-based black company. The change, she said, reflected her desire to support struggling black publishers and the young poets they published as well as her intention to address her work to black readers.         With the new direction of her work and the lack of a major mainstream publisher, however, many of her subsequent books were brushed aside by reviewers for mainstream publications. From the 1970's to the 1990's, she published more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nearly a dozen nonfiction titles, which included two autobiographical works -- ''Report From Part One'' (1972) and ''Report From Part Two'' (1995).         Despite the lack of media attention, Ms. Brooks maintained her reputation as one of America's most respected literary figures. In 1968, she succeeded Carl Sandburg as poet laureate of Illinois. In 1976, she became the first black woman to be elected to the 250-member National Institute of Arts and Letters. She received a lifetime achievement award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989 and another from the National Book Foundation in 1994. She was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.         The Gwendolyn Brooks Chair in Black Literature and Creative Writing was established at Chicago State University in 1990, and there is a Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African-American Literature at Western Illinois University and a Gwendolyn Brooks Junior High School just south of Chicago in Harvey, Ill. She was selected by the National Endowment of the Humanities as its Jefferson Lecturer in 1994 -- ''the absolute award crown of my career,'' she said. And in 1995 she received the National Medal of Arts award.         Despite such praise, Ms. Brooks preferred to stay outside what she called ''the hollow land of fame'' and quietly live and work on the South Side.         ''All my life is not writing,'' Ms. Brooks once told an interviewer. ''My greatest interest is being involved with young people.'' To that end, she devoted much time to giving readings at schools, prisons and hospitals and attending annual poetry contests for school-age youngsters, which she sponsored, judged, and often paid for out of her own pocket.         During her later years, Ms. Brooks tempered her assessment of the young poets of the 60's who had criticized her subjectivity and attention to form. ''Many of the poets felt it was a mark of their quality, of their black and Hispanic quality, if they didn't put a lot of emphasis on technique,'' she said. Although she still sought to write poetry that was ''direct'' and appealed to ''all manner of blacks,'' she insisted on maintaining her own standards.         ''I don't want to imitate these young people,'' she said. ''I have got to find a way of writing that will accomplish my purpose but still sound Gwendolynian.''         A Gwendolyn Brooks Sampler         ''the vacant lot,'' from ''A Street in Bronzeville'' (1945):         Mrs. Corley's three-flat brick         Isn't here any more.         All done with seeing her fat little form         Burst out of the basement door;         And with seeing her African son-in-law         (Rightful heir to the throne)         With his great white strong cold squares of teeth         And his little eyes of stone;         And with seeing the squat fat daughter         Letting in the men         When majesty has gone for the day --         And letting them out again.         ''The Egg Boiler,'' from ''The Bean Eaters'' (1961):         Being you, you cut your poetry from wood.         The boiling of an egg is heavy art.         You come upon it as an artist should,         With rich-eyed passion and with straining heart.         We fools, we cut our poems out of air,         Night color, wind soprano, and such stuff.         And sometimes weightlessness is much to bear.         You mock it, though, you name it Not Enough.         The egg, spooned gently to the avid pan,         And left the strict three minutes, or the four,         Is your Enough and art for any man.         We fools give courteous ear -- then cut some more,         Shaping a gorgeous Nothingness from the cloud.         You watch us, eat your egg, and laugh aloud.       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.       
         Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         ''I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street,'' Ms. Brooks once said.

But there was more to Ms. Brooks's talent than the ability to write about struggling black people, particularly women. There was also her mastery of poetry.         ''Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere rhythms,'' the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the poems in ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' Calling her ''a real poet,'' Mr. Humphries said of her technique, ''There is a range of form: quatrains, free verse, ballads, sonnets -- all appropriately controlled.''         Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of ''Bronzeville'' in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more ''Negro poetry'' than Robert Frost's poetry was ''white poetry.''

And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the         Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.         In 1946 and 1947 Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1949  she published her second volume of verse, ''Annie Allen,'' a portrait of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an experimental form she called the sonnet-ballad. ''Full of insight and wisdom and pity, technically dazzling,'' Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book Review.         ''Annie Allen'' won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949 and the following year was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in 1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.         ''That's why I am as well known as I am today,'' she said in a 1987 interview. ''Sometimes,'' she added with a smile, ''I feel that my name is Gwendolyn Pulitzer Brooks.''         Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, ''Maud Martha,'' which received scant consideration when it was published in 1953. ''Maud Martha'' traced the life of a Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity through a series of 34 vignettes.

But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and invidiously compared with Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In recent years, however, ''Maud Martha'' has had a rebirth, and it is now regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent themes in the works of women writing today.         ''Bronzeville Boys and Girls,'' a collection of children's poetry, appeared in 1956, followed by two poetry collections, ''The Bean Eaters'' (1960) and ''Selected Poems'' (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the racial tensions in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.         They also noticed -- and most applauded -- a sharper colloquial style that was emerging in poems like ''We Real Cool'' from ''The Bean Eaters'':         We real cool. We         Left school.

Blakely, a young writer who later published a volume of his own poetry. They lived in Chicago for the next 30 years and divorced in 1969, but reunited in 1973. He died in 1996. She is survived by a daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely, of Chicago; a son, Henry Blakely III; and one grandchild.         Ms. Brooks's poetry shifted noticeably in form and concern after she attended a conference of black writers at Fisk University in the spring of 1967. While there she listened to readings by Amiri Baraka, Ron Milner and other young firebrand poets. ''I felt that something new was happening,'' she later said.         Those young black writers ''seemed so proud and committed to their own people,'' she added. ''The poets among them felt that black poets should write as blacks, about blacks, and address themselves to blacks.''         She later wrote: ''If it hadn't been for these young people, these young writers who influenced me, I wouldn't know what I know about this society. By associating with them I know who I am.''         Returning to Chicago, she began a poetry workshop in her home that included members of a Chicago street gang called the Blackstone Rangers and younger poets like Sonia Sanchez, Don L. Lee and Nikki Giovanni. Much of the talk was devoted to ways of merging black art with the political concept of black power.         These currents were evident in Ms. Brooks's next volume of poetry, ''In the Mecca'' (Harper & Row, 1968). The 30-page title poem described a mother's frantic search for her missing daughter in a sprawling, decrepit building called the Mecca, which once was one of Chicago's fanciest apartment houses.         In a volume that was described by one critic as ''her declaration of independence'' from the integrationist philosophy that had previously shaped her work, Ms. Brooks wrote about the desperate and tragic lives of the inhabitants of the Mecca. She wrote from experience. Ms. Brooks worked at the real Mecca as a typist for a ''spiritual adviser'' when she was young and got to know the people in the building.         The collection also offered poems about Malcolm X and the Blackstone Rangers:         Black, raw, ready.         Sores in the city         That do not want to heal.         Ms. Brooks used clipped lines, abstract word patterns and random rhymes to capture her new radical tone and her more direct expression of social concern.         ''In the Mecca'' was nominated for a National Book Award.         Asked if the change in her work signaled her emergence as a ''protest poet,'' Ms. Brooks said, ''No matter what the theme is, I still want the poem to be a poem, not just a piece of propaganda.'' Ms. Brooks reflected on her approach in her 1988 poem ''Winnie'':         I am tired of little tight-fisted poems sitting down to         shape perfect unimportant pieces.         Poems that cough lightly -- catch a sneeze.         This is the time for Big Poems         roaring up out of the sleaze,         poems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.         After the publication of ''In the Mecca,'' Ms. Brooks left her longtime mainstream publisher, Harper & Row. ''Rio'' (1969), her next volume of poetry, was published by Broadside Press, a small, Detroit-based black company. The change, she said, reflected her desire to support struggling black publishers and the young poets they published as well as her intention to address black readers.         With the new direction of her work and the lack of a major mainstream publisher, however, many of her subsequent books were brushed aside by reviewers for mainstream publications. From the 1970's to the 1990's she published more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nearly a dozen nonfiction titles, which included two autobiographical works, ''Report From Part One'' (1972) and ''Report From Part Two'' (1995).         Despite the lack of news media attention, Ms. Brooks maintained her reputation as one of America's most respected literary figures. In 1968 she succeeded Carl Sandburg as poet laureate of Illinois. In 1976 she became the first black woman to be elected to the 250-member National Institute of Arts and Letters. She received a lifetime achievement award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989 and another from the National Book Foundation in 1994. She was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.         The Gwendolyn Brooks Chair in Black Literature and Creative Writing was established at Chicago State University in 1990, and there is a Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African-American Literature at Western Illinois University and a Gwendolyn Brooks Junior High School just south of Chicago in Harvey, Ill. She was selected by the National Endowment of the Humanities as its Jefferson Lecturer in 1994, ''the absolute award crown of my career,'' she said. And in 1995 she received the National Medal of Arts award.         Despite such praise, Ms. Brooks preferred to stay outside what she called ''the hollow land of fame'' and quietly live and work on the South Side.         ''All my life is not writing,'' Ms. Brooks once told an interviewer. ''My greatest interest is being involved with young people.'' To that end, she gave many readings at schools, prisons and hospitals and attended annual poetry contests for school-age youngsters, which she sponsored, judged and often paid for out of her own pocket.         During her later years, Ms. Brooks tempered her assessment of the young poets of the 60's who had criticized her subjectivity and attention to form. ''Many of the poets felt it was a mark of their quality, of their black and Hispanic quality, if they didn't put a lot of emphasis on technique,'' she said.  Although she still sought to write poetry that was ''direct'' and appealed to ''all manner of blacks,'' she insisted on her own standards.         ''I don't want to imitate these young people,'' she said. ''I have got to find a way of writing that will accomplish my purpose but still sound Gwendolynian.''         Gwendolyn Brooks: A Literary Sampler         ''the vacant lot,'' from ''A Street in Bronzeville'' (1945):         Mrs. Corley's three-flat brick         Isn't here any more.         All done with seeing her fat little form         Burst out of the basement door;         And with seeing her African son-in-law         (Rightful heir to the throne)         With his great white strong cold squares of teeth         And his little eyes of stone;         And with seeing the squat fat daughter         Letting in the men         When majesty has gone for the day --         And letting them out again.         ''The Egg Boiler,'' from ''The Bean Eaters'' (1961):         Being you, you cut your poetry from wood.         The boiling of an egg is heavy art.         You come upon it as an artist should,         With rich-eyed passion and with straining heart.         We fools, we cut our poems out of air,         Night color, wind soprano, and such stuff.         And sometimes weightlessness is much to bear.         You mock it, though, you name it Not Enough.         The egg, spooned gently to the avid pan,         And left the strict three minutes, or the four,         Is your Enough and art for any man.         We fools give courteous ear -- then cut some more,         Shaping a gorgeous Nothingness from the cloud.         You watch us, eat your egg, and laugh aloud.         Correction:  December 18, 2000, Monday  A obituary of the poet Gwendolyn Brooks on Dec. 5, and in late editions on Dec. 4, referred incorrectly to the publisher of her 1945 anthology ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' At the time, it was Harper & Brothers, not Harper & Row.
