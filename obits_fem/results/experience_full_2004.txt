         Charlotte Zwerin, a documentary filmmaker known for insightful depictions of visual and performing artists like Christo, Willem de Kooning, Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Lisa Tesone said.         Ms. Zwerin worked for many years with David and Albert Maysles, early practitioners of the documentary genre known as cinéma vérité, which uses a small camera to capture the drama of daily experience. Her editing for them was of such quality that they gave her credit as the third director of well-known films like ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), an account of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour of the United States.         It was her decision to include the band members' reactions to the killing of a fan on the stage of a concert at the Altamont Speedway in Livermore, Calif., the site of the tour's last concert.         ''The real hero of the making of the film was Charlotte Zwerin, who edited it and got a directing credit,'' Stephen Lighthill, a cameraman, said in an interview with Salon.com. ''I was stunned with what she got out of my footage. She compressed it and gave you a sense of a buildup of tragedy that you otherwise wouldn't have.''         Other films she did with the Maysleses included ''Salesman'' (1969), an account of four real-life sales representatives of the American Bible Company, and ''Running Fence'' (1978), a chronicle of the successful efforts of the artist Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, to erect a 24-mile fabric fence in the California hills.         Her own films included ''Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser'' (1989), which contained rarely seen clips of the brilliant and eccentric jazz pianist; ''Arshile Gorky'' (1982), a profile of the abstract painter; ''Sculpture of Spaces: Noguchi'' (1995); ''American Masters -- Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live For'' (1999), a biography narrated by Tony Bennett; and ''Toru Takemitsu: Music for the Movies'' (1994), an examination of the Japanese composer. The Museum of Modern Art had a retrospective of her works last year.         Charlotte Mitchell was born on Aug. 15, 1931, in Detroit and developed her affection for film and music as a child by attending an entertainment event in Detroit called ''Big Band and a Movie.'' First came a live band, then the film, she said in an interview with The New York Times last year.         She attended Wayne State University, where she established a film society before moving to New York and finding work as a librarian at CBS for its documentary series ''The 20th Century.'' She slowly worked her way up to editor, then joined Drew Associates, where Robert Drew was pioneering ''direct cinema,'' as cinéma vérité was also called. She met the Maysleses at Drew.         She told The Times she stopped working with the Maysleses because they would not let her produce. ''They cast an awful long shadow, and it came time for me to get out of it,'' she said.         On her own films she became known for a personal signature characterized by innovative editing. Leonard Feather, a critic for The Los Angeles Times, said that her film on Monk provided ''a closer glance behind the veil of this half-hidden, exotically gifted figure than could ever be observed during his sadly aborted career.''         Ms. Zwerin was divorced from Michael Zwerin, a jazz critic. She is survived by her brother, Charles Mitchell, and sister, Margaret Tesone, both of Detroit.         Correction:  January 31, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the documentary film maker Charlotte Zwerin on Tuesday misstated the location of the fatal stabbing of a fan at a 1969 Rolling Stones concert shown in ''Gimme Shelter,'' a film she edited. It occurred in front of the stage, not onstage.       
         Uta Hagen, the formidable and wide-ranging stage actress who electrified audiences with her Tony Award-winning performance as the ferocious, tart-tongued Martha in the original Broadway production of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1962, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter, Leticia Ferrer, said. She was 84.         Over seven decades, Ms. Hagen acted in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Shaw, as well as in plays by Mr. Albee and Tennessee Williams. With her husband Herbert Berghof (who died in 1990), she ran the HB Studios in Manhattan and was celebrated not only as an actress but also as a teacher of acting and author of books on the subject. She continued to teach after a stroke and until several months before her death. Occasionally she appeared in films and on television, but principally her life was onstage, and it was there that she was able to incarnate the widest diversity of characters.         Ms. Hagen made her professional debut in 1937 playing Ophelia to Eva Le Gallienne's Hamlet, and was acclaimed for her Nina (in ''The Seagull''), Desdemona (opposite Paul Robeson's Othello), Shaw's St. Joan, Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and as the title character in ''The Country Girl'' by Clifford Odets. Mr. Albee's Martha became her signature role.         It was a long journey from Ophelia to Martha, but one that she traveled with an unmatchable authority and an intuitive sense of character. Whether she was playing a saint or a termagant, she anchored each role with a firm base in reality. Despite her onstage strength, she said she always considered herself ''a vulnerable actress.'' Once asked what qualities an actress needed to play Martha, Ms. Hagen said, ''Intelligence, voluptuousness and hypersensitivity,'' and then added, ''wit'' -- all of which she had in abundance.         In a recent interview, Mr. Albee recalled her ''extraordinary performances as Desdemona in 'Othello' and Martha in 'Virginia Woolf,' '' and praised Ms. Hagen first as ''a profoundly truthful actress'' and then as ''a dedicated and demanding teacher.''         ''I should add,'' he said, ''she was a great anti-hypocrite, and a superb cook -- not a bad friend to have.''         In 1999, she called her whole goal as an actress ''the spontaneity that comes without planning.'' Whenever possible, she uncovered the drama behind the comedy -- or the comedy behind the drama. As she said, ''Somebody with wit and a sense of humor sees the most tragic event without the sentimentality, sees in any life experience something ludicrous -- which is probably why Chekhov is my favorite.''         She believed a performance should change in the course of the run, depending on the identity of the other actors, the audience response and the actress's mood and temperament. She played Blanche opposite Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn (her favorite), Ralph Meeker, Richard Kiley and Jack Palance. ''If you go on with another actor and your performance doesn't change, you're a bad actor.''         In contrast to many other actors, she loved long runs: ''After a couple of months,'' she said, ''it really starts to get in my bones.'' On keeping a part alive, she called Laurette Taylor her guide. She saw her play Amanda in ''The Glass Menagerie'' 10 times, saying, ''Ten different exciting performances -- to me, that is the magic of the theater.''         Uta Hagen was born in Göttingen, Germany, on June 12, 1919. Her father named her after a 13th-century statue he saw in a Nuremburg cathedral. When Uta was 7, the family moved to Madison, Wis., where her father was head of the department of art history at the University of Wisconsin (her mother was an opera singer). From the age of 6, when she saw Elisabeth Bergner play Shaw's ''St. Joan'' in Berlin, she wanted to be an actress. She studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and at the University of Wisconsin, and left college -- and left home -- to pursue an acting career.         In 1937, Le Gallienne was preparing to play Hamlet in a production in Dennis, Mass., and was having difficulty finding an Ophelia. Ms. Hagen sent a letter requesting an audition. As Le Gallienne recalled in her autobiography, her impulse was to refuse, but something in the letter encouraged her to invite the young actress to audition.         ''She was very young -- only just 17 -- a tall, rather gawky creature, by no means pretty, but with a face that one remembered,'' Le Gallienne wrote, adding she had ''the shy ungainly grace of a young colt.'' For her audition, Ms. Hagen acted the end of the trial scene from ''St. Joan,'' ''quite badly,'' Le Gallienne said, ''and yet I sensed in her an inner truth that very occasionally filtered through in a word or a look.'' She told her to go and think about the role and return in an hour.         ''The improvement was startling,'' Le Gallienne said, ''The truth that had glimmered so faintly in the first reading now blazed up strongly, and the overall effect was strangely moving.'' She cast her.         In the dress rehearsal, she said, ''the sacred fire struck, and the child Uta was transported to a region which I well knew she would not set foot in again for many years to come.'' And so, just 18, Ms. Hagen made her professional debut as Ophelia, an Ophelia that was several inches taller than Hamlet.         She then joined Le Gallienne's theater company, which was preparing a production of ''The Seagull.'' The director was playing the role of Nina, with Ms. Hagen as her understudy. That production never came to fruition, but soon Ms. Hagen heard that Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were about to do it on Broadway.         At the audition, Lunt told her to do something simple, not classical and nothing from ''The Seagull.'' She had planned to do the last scene from ''A Doll's House,'' but at the last minute decided to do Nina anyway. ''I played the whole last scene as Nina alone, without a Konstantin present,'' she recalled, ''and I came offstage in a daze.'' As she headed out the stage door, she was called back, and Lunt (who was playing Trigorin) rehearsed with her long into the night, and then told her she had the part. Ms. Hagen's Broadway debut came the next year as Nina in Lunt and Fontanne's ''Seagull.'' In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson singled her out for praise as ''grace and aspiration incarnate.''         That summer, working in Ridgefield, Conn., she acted in ''The Latitude of Love,'' opposite José Ferrer. In the course of the play, she was required to knock him down. Several months later they were married. During their 10-year marriage, they appeared together in several plays, including ''Angel Street.''         Ms. Hagen is survived by their daughter, Leticia, known as Lettie, of New York City; a granddaughter; and a great-granddaughter.         Ms. Hagen said she considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as ''the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater.'' During that time, she acted in seven Broadway plays, including ''Key Largo'' (with Paul Muni) and ''Othello'' (with Robeson as Othello and Ferrer as Iago). The turning point, she said, was in 1947 when Harold Clurman directed her in ''The Whole World Over.'' The play was forgettable, but she greatly admired Clurman as a director and teacher, and it was in that play that she met Berghof, who replaced another actor in the company.         Having divorced Ferrer, she married Berghof and the two dedicated themselves to teaching actors in their HB Studio, on Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In subsequent years, teaching young actors became as important to her as her own acting. In one of her books, ''A Challenge for the Actor,'' she disagreed with Shaw's pronouncement ''He who can does. He who cannot teaches.'' For her, ''Only he who can should teach.''         In 1948, she led the national company of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and then followed Jessica Tandy in the role on Broadway. In 1950 she played the title role in ''The Country Girl.'' For that performance, she won her first Tony.         The next year, she finally played St. Joan, in Margaret Webster's production. Always outspoken about politics and human rights, Ms. Hagen was blacklisted in the 1950's, and, she said, ''that fact kept me pure.'' Unable to work in the movies or on television or to tour plays through the United States, she continued to focus her attentions on New York theater. She was a member of the Phoenix Theater, but her acting became more sporadic.         Then, in 1962, the call came to return to the stage. The producer Richard Barr and his partners were bringing a new play by a new playwright to Broadway, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, and they were searching for an actress to play the central role. Ms. Hagen read the play between classes and it so gripped her that she taught her final class, she said, ''in a daze.'' Immediately she agreed to do it, and when she met the playwright she told him the play was ''like a great modern Bosch canvas.''         In the play a faculty couple, George and Martha (Arthur Hill and Ms. Hagen) engage in a long night of mutual abuse -- and revelation. Ms. Hagen's performance galvanized the play. ''Virginia Woolf'' was a turning point for the actress and for Mr. Albee. The play received five Tonys, including awards for both Ms. Hagen and Mr. Hill. In 1964, they both did the play in London.         In the years that followed, Ms. Hagen occasionally ventured back into theater. In 1968, she played Mme. Ranevskaya in Le Gallienne's A.P.A. ''Cherry Orchard.'' Later she did Peter Hacks's ''Charlotte'' (in which she played Goethe's mistress), Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell'' and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' Nicholas Wright's ''Mrs. Klein'' and, in 1998, Donald Margulies's ''Collected Stories.''         After playing Martha on Broadway and London and making a recording with the original cast, she did not return to the role -- until 1999.         In a single performance for the benefit of the HB Playwrights Foundation, she played Martha once more in a staged reading on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce played George and Matthew Broderick and Mia Farrow were the couple's two guests.         At 80, she was aware of the pitfalls. ''It's a terrible risk for me,'' she said. ''I'm 28 years too old for the part. I was 42 when I played it. Martha's supposed to be 52. People have such incredible memories of my performance. I don't see how anybody could possibly live up to it, certainly not me, almost 40 years later.''         But once she came onstage, and said Martha's first line: ''Jesus H. Christ,'' followed by her imitation of Bette Davis saying ''What a dump,'' and as she pitched into verbal battle with her husband, the intervening years passed in a cloud.         Correction:  January 29, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the Broadway actress and drama teacher Uta Hagen on Jan. 15 misidentified the German city where the cathedral is the site of a statue for which she was named. It is Naumburg, not Nuremberg.       
         Barbara Gamarekian, a former reporter on the arts and Washington society for The New York Times who was previously a press aide in the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses, died yesterday in Washington. She was 78.         The cause was peritoneal cancer, said a niece, Rachel Hughes.         Ms. Gamarekian arrived in Washington in 1957 to work on the legislative staff of Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.         She joined the presidential campaign staff of John F. Kennedy and was one of nine assistants to President Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre E. Salinger. She was in charge of photo and television coverage.         ''Ours was not the posh West Wing of television fame,'' she wrote in an article in The Times in 2001 that reflected the kind of observation she brought to her many articles about architecture.         ''The room sported harsh overhead lighting, government-issue furniture and limp, gray-green tie-backs on the windows.''         In 2001, she wrote an article for The Times on her experience in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, telling of her surreal night in a bomb shelter under the East Wing that she had never known existed.         Last year, some of her other memories of the Kennedy White House were in the news when an interview she gave in 1964 for the John F. Kennedy Library came to light.         In it, she spoke of President Kennedy's romantic liaison with a college-age intern who could not type. Ms. Gamarekian told some details to the historian Robert Dallek when he was researching his book, ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963.'' The transcript, which Ms. Gamarekian had originally wanted sealed indefinitely, then became public.         ''Certainly it is something that I never discussed because if you are working for the administration, you feel a loyalty to it,'' she said of the affair in the library interview. ''It is the sort of thing you don't discuss, something you profess complete ignorance of when you attend the inevitable cocktail parties where this is the subject for discussion.''         Barbara Soellner was born Aug. 31, 1925, in Schenectady, N.Y.         In 1966, she was hired as an administrative assistant to the chief of the Washington bureau of The Times and eventually became a reporter specializing in cultural news in Washington.         Her subjects ranged beyond the Kennedy Center and National Endowment for the Arts to include a cookbook by Ralph Nader's mother and how men and women communicate. She became particularly known for her articles on what she called the movers and shakers of Washington. She retired from The Times in 1991.         Ms. Gamarekian, who was divorced, is survived by her brother, Glenn Soellner of Burnt Hill, N.Y., and her sister, Robin Hughes of Schenectady.         Her last article, which appeared in The Times in October, brought a light touch to her musings about losing her hair as a result of chemotherapy.         She said her penciled eyebrows gave her the look of an ''aging 1920's flapper.''       
         Corrine Grad Coleman, a founding member of the Redstockings, a women's liberation group in New York, died on July 4 at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.         The cause was heart disease, said her daughter, Patricia Coleman.         Redstockings, a play on bluestockings but with the color of revolution, was an offshoot of New York Radical Women, founded in 1968, whose members included Ms. Coleman. In the same year, New York Radical Women organized the first protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City.         Redstockings, a radical feminist group founded by Shulamith Firestone and Ellen Willis, first appeared in 1969 at a New York City legislative hearing on abortion law reform, when several women tried to take the microphone from the scheduled speakers: 12 men and a nun.         Redstockings held its own abortion ''speak out'' soon afterward at the Washington Square Methodist Church, where members used consciousness-raising techniques to testify about abortion in terms of their own experience.         Ms. Coleman was also one of the leaders of a daylong occupation of the Ladies' Home Journal editorial office by more than 100 feminists in 1970. The women demanded a chance to put out a ''liberated'' issue and the replacement of the editor and publisher, John Mack Carter. The magazine, which had a circulation of 6.9 million, agreed to let the women publish a special section.         Ms. Coleman, a freelance writer, was one of the editors of the Redstockings Manifesto and an editor of ''Feelings: A Journal of Women's Liberation.'' Her writing was published in ''Feelings'' as well as in ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975,'' by Alice Echols (University of Minnesota Press, 1989), The Brooklyn Phoenix and The Village Voice.         Corrine Grad was born on June 30, 1927, in the Bronx. She received a bachelor's and a master's degree from New York University. Her marriage to Joseph K. Coleman ended in divorce in 1977, and he died in 1991.         In addition to her daughter Patricia, of Manhattan, Ms. Coleman is survived by three other children: Amy and Anthony Coleman, both of Manhattan, and Nathaniel Coleman of Newcastle, England; and two grandchildren.         Correction:  July 19, 2004, Monday  An obituary of the radical feminist and writer Corinne Grad Coleman on July 11 misstated her connection to the book ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975,'' by Alice Echols (University of Minnesota Press, 1989). While Ms. Coleman was interviewed and quoted for the book, her own writing does not appear in it.       
         Lilian Moore, a writer of books for children, a poet and an editor who helped make children's books more affordable and worked to combat racial stereotypes in children's literature, died July 20 at her home in Seattle, said her son, Jonathan. She was 95.         A longtime resident of New York City, Ms. Moore was an editor at Scholastic when she suggested in 1957 that the company make its books more accessible by offering low-cost paperbacks through the mail; there were few paperback books for children at the time. She became the first editor of Scholastic's Arrow Book Club, a series of inexpensive editions for pupils in the fourth through sixth grades, and the Lucky Book Club, a similar program for younger readers.         Seven years later, after her stepson, Richard Moore, returned from a summer of civil-rights work in Mississippi and told her that black children there had no books about their own experience, she helped establish the Council on Interracial Books for Children. The council works to discover and encourage minority writers and to confront stereotypes in books for children.         Ms. Moore was also a prolific writer of children's books, including ''Old Rosie, the Horse Nobody Understood'' (1960).         Her ''Little Raccoon'' series, which is still in print in the United States, was translated into Russian and has sold more than 375,000 copies in Russia.         Ms. Moore began writing poetry for children in the late 1960's. In books including ''I Thought I Heard the City'' and ''Sam's Place: Poems From the Country,'' she explored her own childhood memories and wrote about the joy of finding beauty in familiar and unexpected places.         Born Lilian Levenson in the Bronx in 1909 to Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Russia, she graduated from Hunter College in 1930. Unable to find a permanent teaching job during the Depression, she joined the Unemployed Teachers Council and edited its newspaper, The Unemployed Teacher.         As a part-time teacher working with truants, she discovered her ability to help children learn to read. She eventually became a reading specialist in the New York City school system and began writing for children soon after, publishing her first stories in Humpty Dumpty's Magazine.         She is survived by a son from her second marriage, Jonathan Moore of Seattle, and a brother, Milton Levenson of Manhattan. Her third husband, Sam Reavin, died in the early 1990's. Ms. Moore's final books, ''Mural on Second Avenue, and Other City Poems'' and ''Scary Poems,'' will be published posthumously.         Correction:  August 5, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Lilian Moore, a children's author, misstated her role with Scholastic's Lucky Book Club for younger pupils. She was not its first editor; that was the writer and poet Beatrice Schenck de Regniers. (Ms. Moore was, however, the first editor of the company's Arrow Book Club, for pupils in Grades 4 to 6.)       
         Semiha Berksoy, the first lady of Turkish opera as well as one of the most colorful figures in contemporary Turkish art, died Aug. 15 in Istanbul. She was 94.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, her daughter, Zeliha, said.         In addition to her career as a soprano, in which her heavy makeup made her a symbolic image in Turkish culture, she was known internationally for her paintings, which often depicted a little girl, a personification of herself         She was born in 1910 in Istanbul, where her father was an accountant who wrote poetry and her mother was a painter. Her talents were discovered when she was very young, and her parents sent her to the Istanbul conservatory to study music and visual arts. She had her first professional stage experience at 19, and she was 21 when she was given the leading role in the first Turkish sound movie, ''Istanbul Sokaklari'' (''The Streets of Istanbul'').         She was asked to sing in the first Turkish opera, ''Ozsoy,'' in the presence of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, who said he was stunned by her voice.         Soon after, Miss Berksoy qualified for a scholarship to the Berlin Music Academy and left for Germany. She sang the leading role in "Ariadne Auf Naxos" in 1939, the first Turkish opera star to take the stage in Europe.         Despite her success in Germany, she chose to return to Turkey that year and assist in establishing the first opera house in Ankara.         ''She was determined to raise Turkish opera among the leading opera houses in the world,'' Zeliha Berksoy said in a telephone interview.         Miss Berksoy's personal life reflected her revolutionary character, as she never hesitated to visit her lover, the celebrated left-wing Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, in prison, despite the risk of being labeled a Communist.         She also appeared onstage in daring costumes, challenging traditional concepts of stage propriety and classical art.         In a stage performance at the Babylon club in Istanbul in November 2000, she joined a percussion group and performed in a wide spectrum of the arts -- from poetry to singing to drawing to drama -- in a transparent self-painted costume.         She also sang in "The Days Before" at Lincoln Center in New York in 1999, a year before her formal farewell to the stage.         But she never fully retired. In 2003, she participated in the Vienna Biennial with her stage interpretation of ''Salome,'' and she was preparing another project, ''Beethoven Night,'' with Robert Wilson, a friend, for 2005.         A foundation named after her, started by her artist friends, is planning a memorial event for next year to commemorate the 75th anniversary of her career at the State Opera.       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Françoise Sagan, the rebellious French writer who achieved fame as a teenager with her first novel, ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' a precocious tale of sexual disillusionment, but whose international reputation dimmed as literary tastes changed, died yesterday in Honfleur, in northern France. She was 69.         The cause was a blood clot in a lung, friends of her family told Agence France-Presse. She had been in poor health for several years.         Ms. Sagan had an enormous international success with ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' about an amoral teenager who sets out to keep her philandering widowed father from marrying again. The novel was originally published in France in 1954. The following year an English translation reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Sagan was only 19, making her the youngest author to achieve that feat at the time.         By early 1958, the book had sold 810,000 copies in France and more than a million in the United States and had been translated into 20 languages.         Serge Gavronsky, a professor of French literature at Barnard College, said in a 1995 interview that Ms. Sagan's early novels expressed the rebelliousness and cynicism of many of her peers in the French bourgeoisie. Those books, he said, ''were perfectly in accord with a moment of time'' -- the mid-1950's -- and ''well connected'' with France's literary past.         John Updike, writing in The New Yorker 20 years after ''Bonjour Tristesse'' appeared, praised ''its sparkling sea and secluding woods, its animal quickness, its academically efficient plot, its heroes and heroines given the perfection of Racine personae by the young author's innocent belief in glamour.''         Later works by Ms. Sagan appeared repeatedly on best-seller lists in France, and she went on to write more than a score of books, as well as plays, film scripts, short stories and song lyrics. Some of her novels were turned into movies -- ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and ''A Certain Smile'' in 1958 -- and she directed the 1977 French film ''Les Fougères Bleues.''         ''Les Auteurs de la Littérature Française,'' a standard French work for students, described Ms. Sagan's terrain as somewhat limited: ''a worldly, rich, idle, luxurious universe; some characters who live without material cares, who drink, who love themselves without conviction. A taste for the unfinished, for biting analysis, for narcissism. Sagan has forever been recounting the rotting of a generation.''         Roger Shattuck, a cultural historian and professor of French at Boston University, said in 1995 that Ms. Sagan's reputation ''had declined considerably after her first half-dozen novels'' because she wrote too much and repeated herself and because of changing literary fashions.         Ms. Sagan's view of herself and her life was sometimes harsh. In ''Et Toute Ma Sympathie,'' a 1993 book made up largely of reflections, she included a poem in which she called herself ''this bizarre woman, childish and messed up.''         In the first flush of Ms. Sagan's fame, she became known for drinking until dawn and gambling lavishly. It has been reported that she once made a killing at the gaming tables of Deauville and then turned around and used the money to buy herself a turn-of-the-century chateau.         She also praised the joys of driving sports cars. ''Whoever has not thrilled to speed has not thrilled to life,'' she wrote in ''With Fondest Regards'' (1985). ''However madly and hopelessly in love you may be, at 120 miles an hour you are less so. Your blood no longer congeals around your heart; your blood throbs to the extremities of your body, to your fingertips, your toes and your eyelids, now the fateful and tireless guardians of your own life.''         She suffered a skull fracture and other injuries in 1957 when her Aston-Martin overturned while she was living in Milly, a resort town in northern France.         Ms. Sagan was convicted twice of narcotics offenses, in 1990 and 1995, receiving fines and prison sentences, which were suspended.         She once told an investigating magistrate: ''I believe I have a right to destroy myself as long as it does not harm anyone. If I feel like swallowing a glass of caustic soda, that's my own problem.''In 2002 she was also convicted of tax fraud in a case involving payments she received in the early 1990's to intercede with François Mitterrand, a friend and then the president of France, in an oil deal. Her health prevented her from appearing in court.         Ms. Sagan was born on June 21, 1935, in Cajarc, a village in southwest France. She was the third and youngest child of Paul Quoirez, a well-to-do businessman, and his wife, Marie.         Françoise Quoirez, nicknamed Kiki, grew up largely in Lyons and on an estate in the Vercors region in the southeast. When she was 15, her family moved to Paris. She attended convent schools before an unsuccessful academic experience at the Sorbonne.         She took the pen name Sagan because she liked the way it sounded. The name also harked back to the Prince and Princesse de Sagan, 19th-century Parisians on whom Marcel Proust is said to have based some of his characters.         After two years at the Sorbonne, with much time spent in cafes and little studying, she failed crucial year-end examinations in June 1953, angering her family. She felt she ''had to do something'' to placate them, she would recall, so she sat down and wrote ''Bonjour Tristesse'' in August. She had already been thinking about the novel and making notes for it for some months.         The book begins with what has come to be seen as a vintage Sagan sentence: ''A strange melancholy pervades me, to which I hesitate to give the grave and beautiful name of sorrow.''         In ''With Fondest Regards,'' Ms. Sagan, noting that ''Bonjour Tristesse'' enjoyed a ''succès de scandale'' when it first came out in France, said that in those days she could not understand what all the fuss was about.         Looking back three decades later, she said the furor resulted partly from the relationship between the heroine, Cécile, and her boyfriend.         ''It was inconceivable,'' she wrote, ''that a young girl of 17 or 18 should make love without being in love with a boy of her own age, and not be punished for it.''         Furthermore, she added, people couldn't accept that this girl ''should know about her father's love affairs, discuss them with him, and thereby reach a kind of complicity with him on subjects that had until then been taboo between parents and children.''         Ms. Sagan continued to weave fiction from sentences that were a bit abstract in the French way but that at their best dealt trenchantly and economically with the emotions.         Her other novels published in translation in the United States include ''A Certain Smile'' (1956), ''Those Without Shadows'' (1957), ''Aimez-Vous Brahms?'' (1960), ''Wonderful Clouds'' (1962), ''La Chamade'' (1966), ''The Heart-Keeper'' (1968), ''A Few Hours of Sunlight'' (1971), ''The Painted Lady'' (1983), ''Incidental Music'' and ''Salad Days'' (1984).         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1983, Nora Johnson praised ''the grace and freshness of her early novels, those slender tales of love between aged children and middle-aged burnouts that seemed so remarkable when they began appearing in the 50's,'' observing that Ms. Sagan ''seemed to know everything then.''         Ms. Sagan won the Prix des Critiques in 1954 for ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and the Prix de Monaco 30 years later for her work as a whole.         Her 1958 marriage to Guy Schoeller, a publisher, ended in divorce in 1960. Her 1962 marriage to Robert James Westhoff, an American ceramicist and sculptor, ended in divorce in 1963.         Her survivors include a son, Denis, from her marriage to Mr. Westhoff.         Ms. Sagan's views on romance could be somber. In a 1980 interview, she said: ''I think love is like an illness, an intoxication. Sometimes I've been intoxicated for three or four years, but never more. I think that people can be happy together for longer than I used to believe, but I still don't think it can be forever.''         In a 1993 interview before her second drug trial, Ms. Sagan recalled: ''I had incredible luck because just when I grew up, the pill came along. When I was 18, I used to die with fear of being pregnant, but then it arrived, and love was free and without consequence for nearly 30 years. Then AIDS came. Those 30 years coincided with my adulthood, the age for having fun.''       
         Helen Gee, whose Limelight photography gallery in Greenwich Village in the 1950's became a pioneering blueprint for the offering and selling of photography as an art form, died on Sunday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 85. Her death was announced by a friend, John Erdman.         Spacious and well lit, the Limelight was started in May 1954 and supported by the adjoining coffeehouse. Although a market in fine photographs was almost nonexistent, for about seven years Limelight carried on as if there were one, setting the standard for successors that came in a trickle in the early 1970's and grew into a flood by the 1990's. Ms. Gee mounted new shows at roughly five-week intervals and wrote the news releases.         Two earlier galleries -- Alfred Stieglitz's 291 early in the 20th century and Julien Levy's in the 1930's -- had tried to sell photographs but without success. Limelight did somewhat better. An Atget show, with the prints made by Berenice Abbott and priced at $20 each, was almost a sellout. More than half the pictures in an Edward Weston exhibition, at $75 a print, were bought. But rare photographs, photograms and photomontages by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (priced between $100 and $200) failed to sell. Prints by Robert Frank ($25 each) and Julia Margaret Cameron ($65 each) found only a few buyers. Limelight was the showcase for a wide variety of photographic styles, from classic straight photography (Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham) to social documentary (Brassai, Lisette Model, W. Eugene Smith) and subjective and experimental work (Rudolph Burckhardt, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind). Such a roster differed sharply from the generally homogeneous fare found in popular picture magazines like Life and Look.         Before opening Limelight, Ms. Gee had been a successful retoucher of color transparencies. She briefly took photography courses with Alexey Brodovitch, Model and Sid Grossman. But what Ms. Gee lacked in coffeehouse experience, she made up for in iron determination, familiarity with the Village art and photography worlds, and personal charm.         In her 1997 memoir, ''Limelight: A Greenwich Village Photography Gallery and Coffeehouse in the 50's'' (University of New Mexico Press), Ms. Gee recalled with wry humor and unsentimental directness her struggles with freeloading drug addicts, the lack of adequate help, the threat of bankruptcy as well as brutish union officials.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Mary Cantwell described how Ms. Gee ''had to survive a crooked contractor, a plague of city inspectors, hours in the Bowery's restaurant supply stores and an inundation of Seven Sisters graduates and dropouts all looking to be doing 'something' that would bring them closer to the arts.''         Helen Charlotte Wimmer was born on April 29, 1919, in Jersey City. Her father, Peter Wimmer, had trained in Europe as a church decorator. Settling in New York, he supported his family by painting apartments.         At 16, Helen left home to live in Greenwich Village with Yun Gee, a Chinese modernist painter she had met through an art teacher. They were married in 1942. When Yun Gee, subsequently found to be schizophrenic, threatened to turn violent, Ms. Gee left with their infant daughter, Li-lan.         With a child to support, she taught herself transparency retouching, which paid well. By the early 1950's, with leading magazines and advertising agencies for clients, she could afford a secretary, private school for Li-lan and designer clothes. It was during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art that Ms. Gee came across a photography show and was instantly hooked.         Financial and labor pressures forced Ms. Gee to close the Limelight's doors on Jan. 31, 1961. She then became an art consultant and also started to revive interest in Yun Gee's work. When the photography market began to heat up in the late 1970's, Ms. Gee returned to photography, this time as a curator, lecturer and writer.         In late 2001 and early 2002, Ms. Gee offered her collection of photographs for exhibition and sale, first at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago and then at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in New York. Most of the prints had been given to Ms. Gee by photographers whose work had appeared at Limelight.         Ms. Gee's second marriage, to Kevin Sullivan, ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Li-lan Gee, an artist who lives in Easthampton, L.I., she is survived by a sister, Ellen Berland, of Warren, Conn., and a brother, Henry Wimmer, of Bath, N.Y.

         Frederica de Laguna, an anthropologist whose work on the history and culture of little-known Arctic civilizations was groundbreaking in the most literal sense of the word, died on Oct. 6 at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 98.         Her death was announced by Bryn Mawr College, where Dr. de Laguna was the William R. Kenan Jr. professor emeritus of anthropology. She founded the college's anthropology department and taught there from 1938 until her retirement in 1975.         An authority on Alaskan prehistory, Dr. de Laguna was part of the first generation of women to succeed in the rough-and-ready, ultramasculine world of early 20th century field archaeology. She traveled thousands of miles by steamship and skiff, leading expeditions to villages so remote they appeared on no map. There, she contended with -- and generally got the better of -- bitter cold, frozen ground, ravenous mosquitoes and the rare male colleague foolhardy enough to question her ability.         ''I love the actual digging, the rhythmical swing of the arms and the bending and pushing with the whole body,'' Dr. de Laguna wrote in ''Voyage to Greenland'' (1977), a memoir of her first field trip, made when she was 22. ''The sun shines warmly over my back, the rich, sweet smell of rotted blubber rises from the saturated earth.''         In 1975, Dr. de Laguna and Margaret Mead were the first female anthropologists elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Among her best-known books are ''The Archaeology of Cook Inlet'' (1934), ''The Prehistory of Northern North America as Seen From the Yukon'' (1947), ''Chugach Prehistory: The Archeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska'' (1956) and her three-volume masterwork, ''Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit'' (1972). She was the subject of a 1997 documentary film, ''Reunion Under Mount Saint Elias.''         When Dr. de Laguna made her first trip to Alaska, in 1930, Arctic culture was virtually unknown. Victorian explorers had brought back trunkfuls of artifacts, but no scholar before her had studied an Arctic community in depth.         ''She was really trying to find any possible kind of evidence that could converge to give us the overall history of these peoples,'' said Regna Darnell, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario and a former student of Dr. de Laguna's. ''Those early papers are a database that people have worked with ever since.''         Frederica Annis Lopez de Leo de Laguna, almost always called Freddy, was born on Oct. 3, 1906, in Ann Arbor, Mich. She grew up in Bryn Mawr, where her parents taught philosophy. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Bryn Mawr in 1927 and, in 1933, a doctorate in anthropology from Columbia, where she was one of the last students of the anthropologist Franz Boas.         In 1929, while still a graduate student, she joined a Danish expedition to a tiny island on Greenland's west coast. She planned to stay six weeks. She stayed nearly six months.         ''How could I realize the hold which this experience -- the free life, the happy, fascinating natives, the absorbing work and the loyal comradeship -- has obtained over me,'' she wrote in a letter home at the end of the trip. ''I feel as if I could never be content with ordinary living again, unless it were to be broken by a return to the Arctic. It makes me very sad to know that I have found my ideal vocation in such an inaccessible place.''         She was so sure of her vocation, and its incompatibility with married life, that she broke her engagement to a young mining engineer. She never married, and left no immediate survivors.         A Wave in World War II, Dr. de Laguna also studied the Pima Indians of Arizona. She wrote two mystery novels with anthropological settings, ''The Arrow Points to Murder'' (1937) and ''Fog on the Mountain'' (1938).         While Dr. de Laguna's work drew praise from many of the Alaskan Natives whose traditions she explored, she had limited patience with the sensitivities of the multicultural era. In recent years, she was called upon to defend her practice -- routine among anthropologists of her generation -- of opening the graves of indigenous people and removing their contents for study.         With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, many of these remains, which had been in museums for decades, were returned for reburial. Dr. de Laguna regretted the loss to scholarship in no uncertain terms.         ''Some of our ancestors went to the stake for the right to do science,'' she told The Baltimore Sun in 1997. ''Now we have to kowtow to the superstition of these Indians.''       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.
