         Wanda Mary Jablonski, an expert on the international oil industry and founder of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly newsletter, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said Edward L. Morse, the newsletter's publisher.         Ms. Jablonski's career began when she landed a big story in 1945 while still an office messenger at the Journal of Commerce in Manhattan. Filling in for the oil reporter and assigned to cover a news conference conducted by a Venezuelan official, she waited until the session ended to corner him for a private interview. In the interview, he disclosed plans to seize and nationalize all foreign oil operations in Venezuela. He also called for joint action by developing countries with oil reserves, an idea that culminated in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960. Savoir-Faire Was Helpful         Ms. Jablonski became the Journal's oil editor and "the most influentual oil journalist of her time," as Daniel Yergin wrote in his history of the oil business, "The Prize" (Simon & Schuster, 1990). He added that she had the "savoir-faire required to get her through all sorts of situations."         Making her way in a male-dominated industry, she befriended Texas wildcatters, Arab sheiks, corporate executives and important government figures around the globe. She traveled often, once spending six months in the desert; on a visit to Saudi Arabia, she found herself housed in the guest quarters of the king's harem.         McGraw-Hill hired her in 1954 as senior editor of its new Petroleum Week, but the magazine folded in 1961. Jobless, she founded her own weekly, which was 8 to 12 pages and printed on yellow paper. It grew steadily to a circulation in the thousands, despite an annual subscription fee in the hundreds of dollars. The current price is $1,375.         Her newsletter became required reading in the industry for information on explorations, refining, supplies, prices and political trends. The readership ranged from Central Intelligence Agency officials to Middle East rulers. Her early reports on oil company plans occasionally enraged executives, who sometimes temporarily canceled their subscriptions in protest. She sold the weekly in 1988 to the Petroleum Intelligence Group. Born in Czechoslovakia         Ms. Jablonski was born in Czechoslovakia. Her mother was a physicist; her father, Eugene, worked for the Socony Oil Company, and the family followed him around the world to England, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Texas, Europe and Morocco.         After settling in the United States in 1938, Ms. Jablonski earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1942 and a master's in journalism from Columbia University in 1943.         In recent years she worked for the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in Manhattan as the director of the National High-Risk Registry for women with a family history of breast cancer. She donated $3 million to the center.         She was married and divorced three times. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Margaret Berol Craig, a champion shower of horses and trainer of dogs, died Monday at her home in Danbury, Conn. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Craig had been a part owner of her family's company, the Berol Corporation, the manufacturers of Eagle pencils. It was founded in Germany in the early 1800's, moved to New York City in 1856 and later to Danbury, and was sold in 1987.         She was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1935 and the Columbia School of Journalism in 1940 and also attended the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons for two years.         For about 25 years she raised, trained and rode horses for show and jumping, until a back ailment forced her to quit. She then took up the training of Shetland sheepdogs for another 25 years and was the oldest trainer competing in this year's National Obedience Championship, the Gaines Classic.         She is survived by three sons, Geoffrey of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Gregory of Newington, Conn., and Gordon of Sandy, Utah; four grandchildren and a brother, E. Albert Berol of Bedford Hills, N.Y.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted. Flowers were her favorite subject, roses in particular. She exhibited in galleries and sold dozens of paintings for charity.         The Pickens sisters were born in Macon, Ga., and grew up there and in Atlanta. Their parents taught them to harmonize. Their father, a cotton broker, played the piano and their mother sang.         At first the sisters sang for friends, then at churches and schools. The family moved to Park Avenue in Manhattan in 1932, and a test recording for Victor made such an impression with radio executives that they hired the sisters unseen. Promoted as Three Little Maids From Dixie, they appeared in "Thumbs Up" on Broadway and in a movie, "Sitting Pretty." Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.

         Anita Colby, perhaps the nation's first "supermodel" and known as "The Face" after her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, died yesterday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 77 years old.         Miss Colby died of lung disease, her sister, Francine Okie of East Greenwich, R.I., said.         Although her career was launched and revolved around her widely acclaimed beauty, Miss Colby became an author, a newspaper columnist, an advertising executive, chief assistant to Hollywood moguls and a host on the "Today" show -- as well as a model and film actress.         Born Anita Counihan in Washington, on Aug. 5, 1914, Miss Colby was the eldest daughter of Bud Counihan, a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. A Stunning $100 an Hour         At the age of 19, Ms. Colby moved to New York and soon became the nation's most famous and highest-paid model, working for the John Powers agency. With her willowy, ash-blonde beauty, she was the first model ever to receive $100 an hour -- a stunning figure in those days -- and she once appeared on the covers of 15 magazines in a single month, including Time.         "She was the first great model," Miss Colby's longtime friend, Frances Koltun, said yesterday. "She was an extraordinarly stylish woman, and I hate to use that word because it sounds superficial, but she had exquisite taste."         Realizing that she had chosen a short-lived career, Miss Colby moved to Hollywood after only one year as a model and, while on contract with R.K.O., appeared in nine movies, including "Mary Queen of Scots" and "Brute Force." A New Career         But her reviews were hardly raves, and Miss Colby returned to New York in the early 1940's to take a position selling advertising for Harper's Bazaar. A column about her in The Herald Tribune on Jan. 4, 1950, written by Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg, said, "Her contract called for a salary of $55 a week, plus -- and that proved to be a big plus -- 10 percent of all the advertising she brought into the magazine." Miss Colby's sister, Francine, said yesterday, "She sold more advertising than all of them."         To her friends, according to the Herald Tribune column, she said: " 'If I ever go to Hollywood again, I'll tell those stars what to do.' And she did."         In 1944, Miss Colby was hired by David O. Selznick as his studio's "feminine director." Ms. Falkenburg, who became a close friend of Miss Colby, said yesterday: "She was in charge of coordinating all of these stars of the Selznick stable, on screen and off. She decided how they should be photographed, how they would dress, how public they should become, what interviews they should do. She was the den mother for the top beauties in America." Turned Down Clark Gable         And in the process, Miss Colby became friends with Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and others. She also turned down marriage proposals from Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, but let them down easy. "I introduced them to their wives," she told a reporter in 1970 on the occasion of her first and only marriage, to Palen Flagler, a business executive. Mr. Flagler died in 1980.         In 1947, after working for the Selznick organization, Miss Colby served as a $150,000-a-year executive assistant to the head of Paramount Pictures. She later started a public relations company in New York, wrote "Anita Colby's Beauty Book," bought and sold the Women's News Service, for which she wrote a syndicated newspaper column called "Anita Says," and appeared for six months on the "Today" show with Dave Garroway. There he hired Barbara Walters to write her scripts.         Miss Colby is survived by her sister.       
         Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.         She died of cancer, a relative said.         Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.         Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.         Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.         She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.       
         Minnie Mazer Nathanson, a philanthropist involved in the founding of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         She died of lymphatic cancer, said her daughter, Bobbie Abrams of Manhattan.         At the time of her death, she was a member of the boards of the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum and chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel-Jewish Association for College Youth.         She and her three brothers and a sister jointly donated the funds for the construction, in the mid-1950's, of the first dormitory at Albert Einstein College. Mrs. Nathanson and her siblings gave the Mazer Building in memory of their father, Abraham Mazer, who died in 1952. Mr. Mazer was a founder and chairman of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company, based in New York City and later sold to Georgia-Pacific.         Over the years, Mrs. Nathanson was also a vice president and trustee of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, an officer of the Council of Jewish Federations and a member of the board of the New York Association for New Americans.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College.         Her husband, Dr. Louis Nathanson, a radiologist and member of the Albert Einstein College faculty, died in 1968.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Dr. Noel Nathanson of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anna Lopin, and a brother, William Mazer, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Carole Mills Weinberg, a modeling agent and executive, died on Thursday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 49 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.         She was in Little Rock for treatment for cancer at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Center, her husband said.         Mrs. Weinberg was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to the United States with her family. After attending Northwestern University, she began modeling in Chicago and then taught modeling there.         Moving to New York City in the 1960's, she worked as an agent for the Sanford Leigh modeling agency, then became director of the television division of the Ford modeling agency and later director of the casting department at the Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn advertising company. She specialized in television commercials.         She and her husband, William P. Weinberg, became half-owners of Wilhelmina International Limited, the parent company of the Wilhelmina Artists and Wilhelmina Models. He was president of the Wilhelmina organizations, and she was on the board of directors. They sold their share in the company two years ago but remained as consultants for special projects.         Her survivors include her husband and her parents, Adam and Greta Boyce of Mount Prospect, Ill.       
         Margaretha Ley, chief designer and co-founder of Escada AG, the German women's apparel company known for colorful, highly decorated sportswear, died last Thursday in Munich after a long illness.         Mrs. Ley lived in Munich. The company would not disclose her age or cause of death, but she underwent intestinal surgery in recent months.         Mrs. Ley and her husband, Wolfgang Ley, founded Escada in 1979 and built it into an international company that had sales topping $800 million last year. They took the name Escada, which means staircase in Portuguese, from a racehorse, believing it boded well for their future. There are 140 Escada boutiques around the world, including a six-story shop that opened on 57th Street in New York last November. The clothes are also sold in 1,200 specialty and department stores around the world.         In addition to the Escada label, the company also manufactures women's clothing under the Crisca, Laurel, Apriori and Natalie Acatrini labels, produces the Cerruti 1881 women's collection under a licensing agreement and owns a majority percentage of St. John Knits, a California knitwear concern, and Badgley-Mischka, a New York company known for evening wear. The company also makes accessories, luggage, small leather goods and a perfume called Escada. The Leys took Escada public in 1986, retaining 51 percent of the voting stock.         In recent years, Mrs. Ley directed a team of designers who turned out 1,200 styles each season under the Escada label alone. The clothes are divided into color groups, with coordinating shoes, scarfs, gloves and jewelry. New merchandise is shipped to stores every two weeks. Prices are in the upper bracket, with jackets averaging $1,000.         Born in Sweden, Mrs. Ley worked as a model in Stockholm, Vienna and Paris before turning to design. She designed for Mondi, a German sportswear manufacturer, for 10 years before founding Escada with her husband, whom she had married in 1974.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Sven Ley, of Munich, and two children from a previous marriage, Karin Srb, of Munich, and Kristian Srb, of Water Mill, N.Y.       
         Hope Miller Lessman, a former actress and real estate executive, died on July 25 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lance.         As Hope Miller, Mrs. Lessman appeared in numerous dramas on film, the Broadway stage, and in television between 1940 and 1954. Her credits included the live television drama "This Thing Called Love" with Ralph Bellamy in 1948; the 1950 Broadway play "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" with Fredric March, and the 1954 live television drama "The Wages of Fear," with Louis Jourdan.         In 1953 Mrs. Lessman married Herbert L. Miskend, the president of a New York-based apparel company, and retired from acting. When Mr. Miskend died in 1962, Mrs. Lessman became president of Dural Realty Corporation, a company Mr. Miskend had owned, and she managed several buildings on a portion of the site now occupied by the Continental Illinois Building at Madison Avenue and 53d Street in Manhattan. She held that post until 1969, when she sold her property there.         Mrs. Lessman married Jac Lessman, a hotel and resort developer, in 1965. He died in 1990.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Henry. Both are from Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Rodgers, a writer, interior decorator and inventor and the widow of the composer Richard Rodgers, died at her home in Manhattan yesterday. She was 83 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughters, Mary Rodgers Guettel of Manhattan and Linda Rodgers Emory of Katonah, N.Y.         Mrs. Rodgers, whose maiden name was Feiner, was born in New York City. She attended the Horace Mann School and studied art and interior design at Wellesley College from 1926 to 1928. In 1930 she married Mr. Rodgers, who collaborated with the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d on musicals including "Oklahoma!," "South Pacific," "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music." Mr. Rodgers died in 1979.         Mrs. Rodgers founded Repairs Inc., an agency that hired craftsmen to repair broken objects, in 1935 and was its head until 1941. In 1945 she patented the Jonny Mop, which was sold by Johnson & Johnson. It was one of several inventions. In 1958 she created the Basically Yours dress pattern for McCall's, and in 1972 she patented the Turn and Learn storybooks, sold by the Ideal Toy Company. Books for Home and Family         Mrs. Rodgers wrote several books on home design and entertaining, including "My Favorite Things" (1964) and "The House in My Head" (1967). With her daughter Mary, she wrote "A Word to the Wives" (1970), which offered advice on mother-daughter relations. The book led to a nationally syndicated radio program in 1971 and 1972 and a monthly column for McCall's magazine called "Of Two Minds," which ran from 1971 to 1979.         Mrs. Rodgers was an officer of many charitable and arts organizations, including the Authors League of America, the American Institute of Interior Designers, the Public Education Association, the Museum of Modern Art, the American Red Cross, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Jewish Museum.         In addition to her daughters, she is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.

         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party. But when you've read the stories, your next party might may seem to you as if Laurie Colwin had written it."         Ms. Colwin's four novels were "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 1990), "Family Happiness" (Knopf, 1982), "Happy All the Time" (Knopf, 1978) and "Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object" (Viking, 1975). A Focus on Food         Her three collections of short stories were "Another Marvelous Thing" (Knopf, 1986), "The Lone Pilgrim" (Knopf, 1981) and "Passage and Affect" (Viking, 1974). Some of her work was adapted for stage and television.         She also worked as a translator for Isaac Bashevis Singer and wrote for The New Yorker, Mademoiselle and Redbook.         In 1987 Ms. Colwin won a Guggenheim fellowship.         Food was also a focus of her life.  During the campus uprisings at Columbia University in 1968, she cooked forstudent protesters occupying buildings. Later she was a volunteer and a cook for the Coalition for the Homeless and the Antonio Olivieri Shelter for Homeless Women.         She was also a food columnist for Gourmet magazine and wrote two volumes of essays and recipes, "Home Cooking" (Knopf, 1988) and "More Home Cooking" (HarperCollins, 1990).         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton.  Then she began trying her own hand at writing and sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of the Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.

         Margaret Hockaday LaFarge, a pioneer among women in the advertising industry whose saucy, irreverent ads shook up Madison Avenue, died on Friday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 85.         She died in her sleep of heart failure, said her niece, Susan Hockaday Jones.         Miss Hockaday, who used her maiden name professionally, was founder and president of Hockaday Associates, a New York agency with a reputation for whimsy and flair. The Hockaday ads were so inventive that they were frequently reported on in the general press and the trade magazines.         She made her first big splash in 1953 with Dunbar furniture, picturing sofas, armchairs and beds in treehouses, on city streets, in green fields -- everywhere but in their normal setting.         Then followed the Capezio campaign, starting in 1956, in which the shoe company was presented as a state of mind, with shoes not even mentioned in the ads for several years. Her "Capezio people" appeared everywhere; some critics complained that the ads did not picture the product, but they sold shoes.         Her most quoted slogans were for swimwear and Scotch: "Just wear a smile and a Jantzen," and, "As long as you're up, get me a Grant's."         Under her direction Hockaday Associates, which had started out in 1949 in a converted barber shop on 58th Street, moved to 575 Madison Avenue. Her list of accounts grew to include Fuller Fabrics, Crane stationery, Health-tex clothing for children, Elizabeth Arden, Reed & Barton silver, Royal Worcester Porcelain.         Her husband, L. Bancel LaFarge, an architect, died in 1989. Besides her niece, Susan, of Princeton, N.J., she is survived by two nephews, Peter Hockaday of San Francisco and John Hockaday of Alexandria, Va.
