         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Dinah Shore, a vivacious entertainer who was widely loved for her homey, heartfelt singing and breezy Southern charm, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Constance L. Stone, her publicity agent.         Miss Shore's career, which spanned more than 50 years, embraced radio, pop records and television, and reached its zenith in the 1950's and 60's when she appeared four times in a Gallup Poll of the most admired women in the world. Among her many honors were 10 Emmy Awards.         It was on "The Dinah Shore Chevy Show," a weekly television variety program that ran from 1956 to 1963, that she sang the jingle that would become her unofficial theme, "See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet." From 1970 to 1984, she was the host of several television talk programs, in which her vitality and relaxed rapport with celebrities from all walks of life established her as a forerunner of stars like Oprah Winfrey. A Friend of the Camera         "I don't know how to be afraid of that old red eye," she once said, referring to the television camera. "It's one person to me. I don't visualize large numbers of people out there. I'm comfortable with it."         Miss Shore, whose original name was Frances Rose Shore, was born on March 1, 1917, in Winchester, Tenn. She graduated from Vanderbilt University, where she majored in sociology. While in college, she made her radio debut with a 15-minute program on the Nashville station WSM. The theme song of that program was the 1925 hit song "Dinah," a name she adopted legally in 1944.         In 1938, Miss Shore came to New York, where she took a singing job with the radio station WNEW. The next year, she secured a two-week engagement singing with Leo Reisman's popular orchestra at the Strand Theater. In 1940, she began to build a national following as a performer on the NBC program "Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street" and on Eddie Cantor's program, where she was a regular guest for three years before starting her own program.         In 1940, she signed a recording contract with RCA Victor and had her first hits, "The Breeze and I" (with Xavier Cugat's orchestra) and "Yes, My Darling Daughter." These were the earliest of some 75 hit records she recorded between 1940 and 1955. Her 1942 recording of "Blues in the Night" sold a million copies and established her as a sultry blues-tinged balladeer in the tradition of Ethel Waters and Mildred Bailey. 'I'll Walk Alone'         She had her first No. 1 hit in 1944 with "I'll Walk Alone," a quintessential World War II song of longing. Among her other major hits were "The Gypsy" (1946), "The Anniversary Song" (1947), "Buttons and Bows" (1948) and "Dear Hearts and Gentle People" (1949).         "Buttons and Bows" became the most popular in a long line of novelty hits she recorded, trading on her down-home image and Southern drawl. Other such songs were "Shoofly Pie and Apple Pandowdy" and "Pass the Jam, Sam."         The success of "Blues in the Night" led to roles in several movies, including "Up In Arms" (1944) and "Till the Clouds Roll By" (1946). But her movie career was short-lived (she appeared in only seven pictures), and she quickly returned to radio and a new recording contract with Columbia. In an interview in 1981, Miss Shore said she felt she had "bombed" as a movie star. "I'm just not photogenic," she said.         But the charm and vitality that somehow eluded the movie cameras made her one of television's biggest stars for three decades. Much more than her singing, it was her personality -- direct, unpretentious and enthusiastic -- that made her into a symbolic Everywoman of the 1950's and 60's. 1951 Start on TV         She started on television in 1951 with "The Dinah Shore Show," a 15-minute musical program. Then, with the more elaborate "Dinah Shore Chevy Show" in 1956, she became one of the few female entertainers to have long-term success as the host of a television variety program.         In the 1970's, Miss Shore switched from musical variety to talk programs with "Dinah" (1970-74), "Dinah's Place" (1974-79) and "Dinah and Friends" (1979-84). More recently, a weekly cable-television show, "A Conversation With Dinah,' ran from 1989 to 1991 on the Nashville Network, for which she also was the host of specials with Eddy Arnold and Burt Reynolds.         Miss Shore was married twice. Her 1943 marriage to the movie star George Montgomery ended in divorce in 1962. A second marriage, in 1963, to Maurice F. Smith, a professional tennis player, lasted less than a year. During the 1970's, Miss Shore had a six-year relationship with Mr. Reynolds that was highly publicized because she was nearly 20 years older than he.         Miss Shore, a sports enthusiast, played tennis and golf and sponsored a professional golf tournament, the Dinah Shore Classic, in the Palm Springs, Calif., area for more than two decades. She was also the author of three cookbooks, including the best-selling "Someone's in the Kitchen With Dinah."         She is survived by a daughter, Melissa Ann Hime; a son, John David Montgomery, and three grandchildren.       
         Claire Nichtern, who produced or helped to produce several dozen Broadway plays and musicals in her theatrical career, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Nichtern.         From 1979 to 1985 Ms. Nichtern was president of Warner Theater Productions, a division of Warner Communications. During that period she produced over 30 plays and musicals for Warner, among them "Crimes of the Heart" by Beth Henley, which won a Pulitzer Prize.         In 1955 Ms. Nichtern took an aptitude test that suggested that theater production would be a good field for her talents. She accepted a job as a receptionist at the Phoenix Theater in Greenwich Village and rose quickly to casting director.         In the early 1960's she helped in the production of two short plays, "The Typist" and "The Tiger" by Murray Schisgal, starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, at the Theater de Lys. The production was an immediate success.         In 1965 Ms. Nichtern won the Tony Award as best producer of a drama for her Broadway production of Mr. Schisgal's comedy "Luv," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Mr. Wallach, Ms. Jackson and Alan Arkin. Among her other productions of the 1960's and 1970's were "The Banker's Daughter," "Jimmy Shine," "Cold Storage," "House of Blue Leaves," "Absent Friends" and "I Got a Song."         Ms. Nichtern's two marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, David, both of Manhattan.       
         Margaret Millar, whose psychological mystery novels included "How Like an Angel," "A Stranger in My Grave" and "Beast in View," died on Saturday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, said Eleanor Van Cott, a trustee of her estate.         Mrs. Millar earned a reputation as a master of the suspense novel with her carefully constructed, literate mysteries populated by complex, sometimes disturbed characters and rooted in her belief that psychological terror achieved an effectively chilling "violence by implication."  What a Writer Knew         An avid reader of detective magazines as a child, she once told an interviewer: "They tell you always to write about what you know. What I knew was murder."         Mrs. Millar was born in Kitchener, Ontario. Her maiden name was Sturm. She began playing piano at the age of 4, and as a teen-ager performed on local radio programs. She was preparing for a musical career when a classics teacher fired her interest in archeology.         She won a scholarship to University College at the University of Toronto, where she contributed stories to the school's literary magazine. She left college without a degree, and in 1938 married Kenneth Millar, whom she had known since high school.         While recovering from an illness, Mrs. Millar wrote her first mystery, "The Invisible Worm" (1941), about a multiple murder. In short order, she turned out "The Weak-Eyed Bat" (1942), "The Devil Loves Me" (1942) and "Wall of Eyes" (1943). Her success led her husband to try his hand, as well. Under the pen name Ross Macdonald, he achieved a reputation that overshadowed her own. He died in 1983.         Mrs. Millar was prolific. She wrote 21 mystery novels, most of them set in Santa Barbara, notably "A Stranger in My Grave" (1961), "How Like an Angel" (1961), "The Fiend" (1964), "Beyond This Point Are Monsters" (1970) and "Banshee" (1983). "Beast in View" (1955), whose central character finds her personality splitting in two, received the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery novel of the year from the Mystery Writers of America. Branching Out         She also wrote four nonmystery novels and a work of nonfiction, "The Birds and Beasts Were There" (1968).         In 1983, she received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. She served as the president of this organization in 1957 and 1958.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Schlagel of Santa Barbara.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Nadia Gray, an actress best known for her performance in Federico Fellini's 1961 film "La Dolce Vita," in which she did a striptease to entertain a roomful of bored party guests, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Henry R. Silverman, her stepson.         Ms. Gray, who often played elegant, aristocratic women, had her first big break in the theater when Noel Coward made her his co-star in the Paris production of his play "Present Laughter." Her success in that role brought her offers from British film makers. She subsequently appeared in "The Spider and the Fly" (1952) with Eric Portman, "Night Without Stars" (1953) with David Farrar and "Mr. Topaze" (1961) with Peter Sellers.         She went on to make films in France, Italy and the United States. Among her other screen credits are "La Parisienne" (1958) with Charles Boyer, "Candide" (1962) with Jean-Pierre Cassel, "The Crooked Road" (1965) with Robert Ryan, "The Naked Runner" (1967) with Frank Sinatra and "Two for the Road" (1967) with Audrey Hepburn.         Ms. Gray also had a career as a singer, appearing in clubs and on television and radio shows in the United States and abroad.         In addition to her stepson, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Herbert R. Silverman, and a stepdaughter, Karen Mayers of Washington.       
         Edith K. Bergtraum, a teacher at Public School 143 in Corona, Queens, for 25 years, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. Mrs. Bergtraum, who lived in Kew Garden Hills, Queens, was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Bergtraum.         Mrs. Bergtraum, a graduate of Hunter College, taught at the elementary school from 1960 to 1985. In 1974 she became a member of Community School Board District 25 in Flushing and served for 19 years. She had also served since 1973 as a member of the New York City Commission on the Status of Women.         She is survived by two daughters: Judith of Kew Garden Hills and Marcia Williams of Lake Success, L.I.; a son, Howard, of Old Westbury, L.I., and two sisters, Janice Sommer of Roslyn, L.I., and Pearl Schenkler of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Danitra Vance, an actress and performance artist who appeared in "The Colored Museum" and "Spunk" at the New York Shakespeare Festival, died on Sunday at the home of her grandfather, Clarence M. Edwards, in Markham, Ill. She was 35 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, said her companion, Jones Miller.         Once described as a cross between Laurie Anderson and Little Richard, Ms. Vance appeared in feature films and in 1985 became the first black woman to join the regular cast of "Saturday Night Live."         But it was through her association with George C. Wolfe, the playwright and director who is now the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, that Ms. Vance was best known to theatergoers. In "Spunk," Mr. Wolfe's 1990 adaptation of stories by Zora Neale Hurston, she demonstrated "exceptional range in playing a trio of women who are in turn worn to the bone, full of sass and aglow with innocence," wrote Frank Rich in The New York Times. Ms. Vance received an Obie Award for her performance.         Ms. Vance was born in Chicago. She attended the National College of Education in Evanston, Ill.; Roosevelt College in Chicago, from which she graduated with honors, and the Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After performing with the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago, she moved to New York in 1981, where she became an Off Broadway success with her 1985 revue "Danitra Vance and the Mell-o White Boys." In it, she created a range of comic characters including a ghetto Shakespearean actress, a feminist stripper and a genteel "lesbian recruiter."         Ms. Vance last appeared at the Public in the spring as the guardian angel in Jose Rivera's "Marisol." After breast cancer was diagnosed in 1990, she used her experience of the illness in a performance piece called "The Radical Girl's Guide to Radical Mastectomy." "Pre-Shrunk," an autobiographical show in which she expanded on this material, was scheduled at the Public Theater last season, but Ms. Vance was unable to perform.         In addition to Ms. Miller and Mr. Edwards, Ms. Vance is survived by her mother, Laura Vance of Chicago, and a sister, Latrice Lee, of Markham.       
         Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.         The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.         Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.         Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.         Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Amy Clampitt, known for her dense, ornate and allusive poetry, died on Saturday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 74 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Anne Close, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf.         Ms. Clampitt published her first full-length book of poetry, "The Kingfisher," when she was 63. It was a delayed but auspicious beginning. Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that the author "immediately merits consideration as one of our most distinguished contemporary poets." The work, which challenged readers with long strings of dependent clauses, an often obscure vocabulary and arcane literary allusions, ran counter to the prevailing taste for pared-down, plain speech. Instead, she offered "baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon," the poet Alfred Corn wrote in a review.         Ms. Clampitt was born in New Providence, Iowa, and grew up on a 125-acre farm. After earning a bachelor's degree with honors in English at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1941 she studied at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         She worked as a secretary and a writer at Oxford University Press from 1943 to 1951 and as reference librarian at the National Audubon Society from 1952 to 1959. Through the 1960's and most of the 70's, she was a freelance writer, editor and researcher. From 1977 to 1982 she was an editor at E. P. Dutton. Initially Self-Published         In college, Ms. Clampitt succumbed to the spell of Gerard Manley Hopkins, but she wrote little poetry at the time. In the 1950's, she made unsuccessful stabs at novel writing. It was not until the 60's that she began writing poetry in earnest, initially without success. In 1974, at her own expense, she published a poetry chapbook, "Multitudes, Multitudes." The work caught the eye of Howard Moss, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, who began publishing Ms. Clampitt regularly. In 1981, a second small collection, "The Isthmus," was published.         "The Kingfisher," published in 1983 by Alfred A. Knopf, immediately pushed its author to the front ranks of American poets. Organized around the elements earth, air, fire and water, it treated subjects as various as the plants and marine life of New England, John Lennon's murder, the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.         Comparing Ms. Clampitt to Hopkins, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, critics noted her pinpoint descriptions of the natural world that led to unexpected metaphysical insights and conclusions. She once referred to herself as "a poet of place," a characterization that she later revised to "a poet of displacement." From Life and Myth         "What the Light Was Like" (1985, Knopf) solidified its author's reputation. Like "The Kingfisher," it began with several poems about the New England coast, notably the book's title poem, an elegy for a drowned lobsterman.         In "Archaic Figure" (1987, Knopf), inspired in part by the author's travels in Greece, Ms. Clampitt used Greek myth to explore what Virginia Woolf called "the ancient consciousness of women." Her other major collections were "Westward" (1990, Knopf) and "A Silence Opens" (1994, Knopf).         She also published an essay collection, "Predecessors, et Cetera" (1991, University of Michigan Press) and edited "The Essential Donne" (1988, Ecco Press).         Ms. Clampitt received a fellowship award for distinguished poetic achievement from the Academy of American Poets in 1982 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. She was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         She is survived by her husband, Harold L. Korn; two brothers, Lawrence, of Brunswick, Me., and Philip, of Auburn Hills, Mich., and a sister, Beth, of Carlisle, Iowa.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Pearl Primus, a pioneering dancer, choreographer and teacher whose anthropological work exposed Americans to the realities of black life in America and to the richness of African and Caribbean dance, died on Saturday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 74.         Miss Primus died after a brief illness, said Joyce Knight, a friend.         A powerful performer and lecturer, Miss Primus played a role similar to that of Katherine Dunham in establishing dance by and about blacks as an important part of American culture. Her belief that there was material for dance in the everyday lives of black people -- and her strong personality and early success -- had a profound influence on several generations of black choreographers and dancers, among them Donald McKayle and Alvin Ailey.         Miss Primus visited Africa for the first time in 1948, but she had begun to present carefully researched dance with African themes in 1943 and was the first American choreographer to do so. In 1974, her contributions were celebrated in a salute to her and the ballerina Janet Collins by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         But Miss Primus was equally celebrated for her depiction of American life and of the injustices inflicted on black Americans, particularly in the American South. In one of her best-known dances, "Strange Fruit," a woman reacts in horror to a lynching. "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" -- created, like "Strange Fruit," in 1943 and inspired by the Langston Hughes poem -- depicted the Mississippi and the hard lives of blacks along its shores. "Dance has been my freedom and my world," she said in 1991. "I dance not to entertain but to help people better understand each other."         An accident of fate led Miss Primus to become a dancer. Born in Trinidad, she was brought to the United States as a child by her parents. She received a bachelor's degree in biology and pre-medical sciences from Hunter College with the intention of becoming a doctor. Unable to find a laboratory job open to blacks, she applied to the National Youth Administration and was put into a dance group.         She enrolled in modern-dance classes at the New Dance Group, where she began to teach, and in 1943 gave the first performance of her own work. John Martin wrote in The New York Times that "if ever a young dancer was entitled to a company of her own and the freedom to do what she chooses with it, she is it."         A few months later, Barney Josephson invited Miss Primus to perform at his Cafe Society Downtown. Troubled by having to choose between medicine and dance, she consulted Mr. Martin. No one would ever be able to say, he told her, whether art or medicine had the greater curative power. Miss Primus remained at the nightclub for 10 months. When there was a problem with the music during her first performance there, a burly man rose from the audience and encouraged her to keep on, teasing her about having broken up his home by teaching his son the Lindy Hop. The man was Paul Robeson, one of many black cultural figures with whom Miss Primus would become friendly over the years.         Miss Primus toured with the musical "Show Boat," then founded a company and presented her work on Broadway and in national tours. On one Southern tour, she was offered a Rosenwald Foundation scholarship to study dance in Africa. Later, she worked there with local performers. She married Percival Borde, a dancer she met on a visit home to Trinidad in 1953, and they founded a popular school in New York and performed frequently together. Mr. Borde died in 1979.         Miss Primus was made director of a new performing-arts center in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1959. Two years later, she and Mr. Borde performed throughout Africa with their dancers and musicians on a tour sponsored by the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. It was not until 1978 that she completed her work for a doctorate in anthropology at New York University.         "My life has been like traveling up a river," she told an interviewer in 1979. "Every now and then I would hear singing around the bend, and so around the bend I would go and become occupied with living."         Miss Primus continued to perform until 1980, after which she was the director of the Cora P. Maloney College, a black studies school at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and was Five-College Professor of Ethnic Studies at schools in Massachusetts in the 1980's. She was an early and important participant in "The Black Tradition in American Dance," a program to revive and preserve black dance that began in 1988 at the American Dance Festival, where in 1991 she was named the first recipient of the Balasaraswati/ Joy AnnDewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching. Other honors included the National Medal of the Arts in 1991. Miss Primus continued to teach throughout the United States until her death.         She is survived by a son, Onwin Borde of Miami.       
         Evelyn Anderson, believed to be the last surviving member of the troupe that danced with Josephine Baker in "La Revue Negre" in Paris in the 1920's, died on Oct. 29 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, her family said.         Miss Anderson was 18 and had worked as a dancer in several shows produced by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake when she was recruited to join a revue, as yet unnamed, going to Paris.         The troupe was formed by a wealthy Chicago woman, Caroline Dudley, who had backed other shows featuring black artists. The star of the revue was to have been a singer and dancer named Maude de Forest. Miss Baker came to the fore when an artist named Paul Colin featured her in a now-famous poster for the show, which the French producers decided to call "La Revue Negre." The show became an instant success and made Miss Baker an international star.         The revue was scheduled to go to Berlin and Moscow after the Paris engagement, but when Miss Baker broke her contract and went to the Folies Bergere, the company broke up. Miss Anderson was among those who chose to remain in Europe, and for the next 15 years she performed in revues and night clubs on the Continent.         When World War II broke out, she was working in the Netherlands, dancing in a cabaret in The Hague, according to Jean-Claude Baker's book about his adoptive mother, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart." When the Germans conquered the Netherlands, they deported her, her partner Harry Watkins and several of her friends.         They were interned first in the Netherlands and later moved to a camp in Germany. In 1943, they were released in a prisoner exchange and made their way back to the United States. In 1944, Miss Anderson married Robert Robbins, an orchestra leader in the Philadelphia area.         She is survived by two brothers, John and Thomas Anderson.
