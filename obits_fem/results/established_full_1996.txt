         Rhoda Haas Goldman, a San Francisco civic leader and benefactor of a wide variety of causes, died on Saturday while vacationing in Honolulu. She was 71.         She suffered a heart attack, said Duane Silverstein, executive director of the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund in San Francisco.         Over the past five years the fund has contributed some $25 million in grants to cultural and environmental causes. She and her husband, Richard, also established the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1990 to reward grass-roots environmentalists around the world.         Mrs. Goldman, a San Francisco native and graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, was a vice president and past president of the San Francisco Symphony and chairwoman of her city's Memorial to the Six Million Victims of the Holocaust. She was a director of the Mount Zion Health System and former president of the Mount Zion Hospital and Medical Center.         A great-grandniece and heir of Levi Strauss, the denim king, she was a corporate director of his apparel concern, Levi Strauss & Company.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Goldman's survivors include two sons, John D., of Atherton, Calif., and Douglas E., of San Francisco; a daughter, Susan R. Gelman  of Chevy Chase, Md.; a brother, Peter E. Haas Sr., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Esther S. Manz, who was a 208-pound housewife pregnant with her fifth child when a kitchen-table gathering in 1948 inspired her to found TOPS, a weight-loss support group that grew into a 300,000-member nonprofit organization, died on Monday at the Heritage Nursing Home in Milwaukee. Mrs. Manz, who made her home in Greenfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, was 88.         TOPS, which stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly, draws its philosophy from something the 5-foot-2-inch Mrs. Manz, then 40, observed in group sessions intended to prepare women for childbirth: the power of mutual support in helping participants remain within their doctors' guidelines for weight.         TOPS members work out a sensible diet and weight goal with their physician and provide evidence of having consulted a doctor before attending weekly meetings that include a weigh-in and provide support and encouragement for members.         Men and women who achieve their weight goals become KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly), role models who are themselves reinforced in their efforts to maintain their weight by continuing to attend meetings.         "Life is a battle," Mrs. Manz once said. "Just let us win the one on obesity."         According to data from the weekly weigh-ins, TOPS members in 12,000 chapters  in the United States and abroad lost more than 740 tons last year, a spokeswoman said yesterday.         The nonprofit organization, based in Milwaukee, is supported by membership dues -- $16 in each of the first two years and $14 thereafter. When Mrs. Manz wrote TOPS's articles of incorporation in 1952, she committed it to finding a cure for obesity, and TOPS says it has contributed more than $4.5 million to obesity research.         After Mrs. Manz and three friends established their support group at her kitchen table in Milwaukee, the organization's name took its final form as the result of a newspaper article.         Mrs. Manz said she originally thought of it as TOP. "We didn't even have a name for our club at first, but when we went down to The Milwaukee Journal to be interviewed about our organization, the reporter asked what we called ourselves," she said in the group's handbook for new members. When the article was published, the name appeared as TOPS, and Mrs. Manz said it was later suggested that the S be made to stand for "sensibly."         On Jan. 21, 1948, the first meeting of TOPS was held at a Milwaukee community center. In the early days of the organization, Mrs. Manz carried a scale with her as she made her rounds as roving ambassador, organizing meetings.         Mrs. Manz, who achieved average proportions in her effort to control her weight, became president and chairwoman of the TOPS board in 1952. Declining health prompted her to relinquish the presidency in 1991, but she remained chairwoman until her death.         Born in 1907 in Plymouth, Wis., she grew up as Esther Schuland and graduated  in 1926 from Wisconsin State Teachers College. She taught at rural Wisconsin schools, married Gilbert Manz, a steelworker, in 1929 and later moved to Milwaukee, where she became a housewife.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Manz is survived by a son, Gilbert Jr.; four daughters, Bonnie Prieben, Maureen Weigert, Barbara Canapa and Marjory von Hof;  a brother, Carl Schuland, of Green Bay, Wis., 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. All of Mrs. Manz's children live in Milwaukee except for Mrs. von Hof, a resident of Altura, Minn.       
         Helen Bunce, who knitted so many mittens she didn't know what to do unless she was knitting more mittens, died on Feb. 24 at a nursing home in Watertown, N.Y., where she was known as the Mitten Lady. She was 86 and had been knitting mittens until a few days before her death.         Mrs. Bunce had been a legend in Watertown and in international church circles for decades, although until December only a few people knew she was the Mitten Lady whose anonymous handmade donations to an annual church clothing drive had spread her fame far and wide.         Since 1948, when the third-grade Sunday school class at the Emmanuel Congregational Church in Watertown established a special Christmas tree to collect clothing for poor children, Mrs. Bunce had spent every otherwise spare moment knitting away.         "She could knit in her sleep," her daughter, Helen McDonald, said yesterday,  estimating that her mother had knitted at least 4,000 pairs of mittens over the  last 47 years, and probably a lot more.         "She didn't keep records in the early years," Mrs. McDonald said, "but some years she did more than 200."         For all the mittens she turned out, the Mitten Lady sobriquet was somewhat misleading. Mrs. Bunce, who knew that little heads as well as hands needed protection against the cold, knitted a matching cap for every pair of mittens and also turned out scarves.         The sets, which included a handwritten tag saying "God Loves You, and So Do I," were distributed to various churches and charities in Watertown and through  Church World Service, the Protestant relief agency, to poor children across the  nation and abroad.         As word of Mrs. Bunce's work spread, people across the country began sending  her yarn in care of the church, and she kept a scrapbook of thank-you notes from children she had helped and photographs showing some of them wearing her handiwork. Like the donated packages of yarn, the notes, addressed simply to the Mitten Lady, were delivered to the church and then passed on to her.         Mrs. Bunce, who lived in Watertown most of her life, carried her knitting wherever she went, clicking away whenever she found a spare moment. Her mittens, which always included two contrasting colors in striking designs, came in three  sizes, with the colors becoming darker as the sizes increased.         Although she suffered from osteoporosis so painful that she found it difficult to sit in a wheelchair in her last months, Mrs. Bunce, who had taught  herself to knit lying down after entering the nursing home, insisted on being taken to the church in December to make her usual surreptitious donation of her  year's production.         This time her cover was blown. She was introduced to the congregation as the  Mitten Lady, and the woman who had once explained that she labored anonymously because the purpose of her work was to help poor children and not to have people say, "Oh, that's wonderful," had to endure a five-minute ovation.         Then she went back to the nursing home and continued her knitting. Mrs. Bunce, who always made it a point to start a new pair of mittens or a cap as soon as one was completed (on the assumption, she once explained, that God would not let anything happen to her as long as she had unfinished work), apparently knew the end was near. When she died, her daughter said, her needles were empty.         Mrs. Bunce's husband of 67 years, Karl, died on Feb. 27. In addition to her daughter, of Alexandria Bay, N.Y., she is survived by two sons, Roy, of Strasbourg, France, and Jack, of Watertown; 11 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Betty Meredith-Jones, a dance educator and a pioneer in the field of movement rehabilitation and community dance in Britain, died last Sunday at her home in Rhosili, Wales. She was 87.         Ms. Meredith-Jones, born in Wales in 1908, trained as a young dancer with Rudolf Laban, a movement theorist. She taught physical education and dance before coming to the United States in 1952. In the late 1950's she came to Manhattan, where she began teaching movement classes for the elderly. In the early 60's, at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, she established a pilot program in the rehabilitation through movement of patients with Parkinson's disease.         Ms. Meredith-Jones received a master's degree from Columbia University and taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and the New School for Social  Research.         She is survived by a sister, Georgina Meredith-Jones.       
         Frances L. Loeb, who spent a dozen years as New York City's liaison to its vast corps of foreign diplomats and a lifetime maintaining a family tradition of philanthropy, died on Friday at her home on Park Avenue. Mrs. Loeb, who also had homes in Purchase, N.Y., and Lyford Cay, Nassau, the Bahamas, was 89.         "One thing I had in my mind," Mrs. Loeb said in 1990 when she announced a $7.5 million gift to Vassar College for construction of an art center, "I'm never going to be the richest person in the cemetery."         With her husband, John L. Loeb, an investment banker, and other family members, Mrs. Loeb was a benefactor of Barnard College (where Adele Lehman Hall  was named for her mother), of Central Park (the Loeb Boathouse and the Children's Zoo), Lewisohn Stadium (which bore her maternal grandfather's name),  the Loeb Student Center at New York University and the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar.         In 1990, the Loebs pledged $70.5 million to finance new faculty positions and scholarships to Harvard College, as well as programs and positions in the schools of design and public health. The gift also benefited the Loeb Drama Center, home to the American Repertory Theater, established in 1957 with help from the Loebs.         Mrs. Loeb was also a trustee of Vassar and Cornell University and an overseer of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         In addition to money, Mrs. Loeb gave time. For 12 years in the 1960's and 70's, during the administrations of Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, Mrs. Loeb was New York City's unsalaried commissioner for the United Nations and for the Consular Corps. Directing a staff of nine full-time and six part-time employees, Mrs. Loeb eased cultural shock and fostered amity in a foreign diplomatic community that numbered 35,000 people from 197 missions and 91 consulates.         Besides forgoing a salary, Mrs. Loeb stretched the commission's relatively scant $158,000 budget by coaxing, cajoling and wheedling tens of thousands of dollars from friends and family. She committed the gifts to financing lectures,  establishing nursery schools, providing counseling about high schools and colleges and sponsoring courses in English.         In 1976, Mrs. Loeb and her staff handled more than 1,800 inquiries about housing, education, traffic, consumer fraud, police, family matters and legal problems. Thirty volunteers made more than 900 visits or telephone calls to 796  new diplomatic arrivals, and Mrs. Loeb attended endless receptions, lunches and  dinner meetings.         Frances Lehman Loeb was born in Manhattan on Sept. 25, 1906, into two of the  German-Jewish families whose rise to prominence and zeal for public service were chronicled in Stephen Birmingham's 1972 book, "Our Crowd." These 100 or so families founded banking, securities and retailing empires and many were known for their philanthropies. Her mother was Adele Lewisohn, the daughter of Adolph  Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. One uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, became Governor of New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, became Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals.         Frances Lehman attended Vassar from 1924 to 1926. In 1926 she and John Loeb were married in the Park Avenue apartment of her grandfather Adolph Lewisohn. From the 1930's through the 1970's, Mr. Loeb was a partner in the investment firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Loeb was known as Peter, a name she traced to the days when she was "the unwanted girl baby" and "Peter Pan" was playing on Broadway.         "I was a sick child," she said, "and they called me Peter Pan, hoping that I  would live forever."         Besides her husband of 69 years, Mrs. Loeb is survived by their five children: Judith L. Chiara of Manhattan and Purchase, John L. Loeb Jr. of Manhattan and Purchase, Ann Loeb Bronfman of Washington, Arthur Lehman Loeb of Manhattan and Deborah Loeb Brice of London; 14 grandchildren, and more than 30 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Rosamond Haas, a professor of linguistics whose interests ranged from American Indian languages that were dying to the prehistory of languages and modern Thai, died on May 17 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         She suffered a long illness, according to the University of California at Berkeley, where she retired as professor emerita in 1977.         She, along with a handful of graduate students, was trained at Yale University by Edward Sapir, the legendary linguist and anthropologist, and became a force behind the Survey of California Indian Languages. Financed by the State Legislature, the project provided the wherewithal for sending qualified graduate students into the field for studies of the spoken native American word.         The program, started as a pilot project in 1949, surveyed cultures and languages presumably doomed to oblivion. In 1953, the survey of surviving Indian tongues became official, and the graduate department of linguistics was established on the Berkeley campus.         In the 1950's and 1960's, Dr. Haas used the survey for intensive explorations of the native languages in California and beyond. Such efforts inspired more than 40 dissertations and the careers of a generation of ethnolinguists.         Dr. Haas was a graduate of Earlham College in her native Richmond, Ind. She received a degree in comparative linguistics at the University of Chicago in 1931 and a Ph.D. at Yale in 1935. Her dissertation was on Tunica, an Indian language once spoken in what is now Louisiana.         She then delved into fieldwork with various other endangered or extinct species: Natchez, the only known member of its family of languages, as well as several of the Muskogean branch-offs, like Creek-Seminole.         As the entry of the United States into World War II loomed, she started working with the Thai language. She helped prepare Thai materials for the armed  forces and taught the language in a special training program at Berkeley, an experience that led to her appointment as an assistant professor of Siamese and  linguistics in 1947. She was promoted to professor of linguistics in 1957.         Her books in print include "Language, Culture and History: Essays" (Stanford  University Press, 1978), "Prehistory of Languages" (Mouton, 1978), "Thai Vocabulary" and "Thai System of Writing" (Spoken Language Service).         Dr. Haas is survived by a brother, Robert Haas, of Elkhart Lake, Wis.       
         Mollie H. Beattie, who resigned as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 6 because of failing health, died on Thursday at Grace  Cottage Hospital in Townsend, Vt. She was 49 and lived in Grafton and Alexandria, Va.         The cause was brain cancer, said a friend, Alexandra M. Marks.         A forester by training, Ms. Beattie was the first woman to head the agency.  In three years as director, she defended the Endangered Species Act against attacks from many Republicans in Congress and fought efforts to reduce the agency's budget, not always successfully.         "In the Clinton Administration, she was probably the strongest single voice for wildlife conservation," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit group that works to protect and preserve species.         Ms. Beattie was a strong proponent of the effort to have gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park for the first time since the 1920's. Mr. Schlickeisen  said one of his most vivid memories of her was seeing her rub cold water on the  belly of a wild wolf at Yellowstone in April to cool it so the animal could be moved to another site for release. Despite the rain in her face, he recalled, she smiled broadly and said, "Any day I can touch a wild wolf is a good day."         As director, she was responsible for the wildlife service's 7,000 employees and an annual budget for resource management of $501 million in the current fiscal year, down from $511 million the previous year. The agency, part of the Interior Department, enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species  Act and carries out wetland protection and management. John Rogers has been serving as acting director.         Ms. Beattie sought to conserve species by managing entire ecosystems rather than waiting until individual species became endangered, and presided over the addition of 15 national wildlife refuges to a system that now has 508.         The agency said that under her direction 140 habitat conservation plans were  established and 300 more were being developed. These plans are formal agreements between landowners and the Fish and Wildlife Service that allow the owners to harm individual members of a species listed as endangered or threatened if they  take steps to help the species as a whole to recover.         She argued that such plans demonstrated that the Endangered Species Act, under which they are carried out, has the flexibility to conserve species while  allowing economic development. In fact, she said, the act "has been one of the biggest success stories of the conservation movement in America," contending that many myths had been spread about the act's supposedly onerous effects.         Just before she resigned, she led efforts to resume the listing of endangered species after a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, which sharply cut the agency's money for such listings in the current fiscal year.         Earlier this month, Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in the House and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in the Senate to name an eight-million-acre wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after her.         Mollie Beattie was born on April 27, 1947, in Glen Cove, L.I. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1968 and a master's degree in forestry at the University of Vermont in 1979. She also received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1991.         She was program director and lands manager for the Windham Foundation, a nonprofit organization that conducts seminars on critical issues facing Vermont, from 1983 to 1985; commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and  Recreation from 1985 to 1989, and deputy secretary of the state's Agency of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1990. She left to become executive director of a  public policy institute, the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government in Vermont, before taking her post at the Fish and Wildlife Service.         She is survived by her husband, Rick Schwolsky of Grafton; her mother, Patricia Beattie of Ketchum, Idaho, and a sister, Jane Beattie, also of Ketchum.       
         Justice Birdie Amsterdam, who achieved several judicial firsts, including being the first woman elected to the New York State Supreme Court, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Lower East Side, just steps from where she was born.         Justice Amsterdam came to be called the "first lady of the judiciary" by her  peers and other admirers, a sobriquet earned during 35 years on the bench.         She was the first woman elected to the Municipal Court in New York County in 1940. She was active in the Democratic Party, but when she was up for re-election in 1949, she carried the endorsements of all three parties, all bar  associations, the Citizens' Union and the American Federation of Labor.         In 1954, she was appointed Acting Justice of the City Court, another first for a woman, and won election to the office the next year.         In 1958, she gained the Supreme Court bench as a Democrat-Liberal, supported  again by a long roster of civic, communal, educational, labor, scientific, philanthropic and religious groups. She served until 1975.         Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the first woman on the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest tribunal, recalled Justice Amsterdam's trailblazing  achievements in a 1991 article in the New York Law Journal.         The State Supreme Court was more than 250 years old before a woman was elected to it, Judge Kaye wrote, and even today women do not enjoy the status of equals in the legal profession. "Thoughts of Justice Amsterdam's arrival on the  New York State Supreme Court serve to remind of us both of how far we have advanced toward these objectives and how much they continue to elude us," she wrote.         Justice Amsterdam was one of six children of Joseph Amsterdam, a band leader  from Austria. At 12, she taught English to foreign-born neighbors. Growing up in a neighborhood of immigrants and the poor awakened a commitment to social issues that guided her life as a lawyer. Her concerns ranged from playgrounds to summer camps, from slum clearance to shelter for the aged and the infirm, and from medical care to tuition assistance that could give a student a leg up. One of her special interests was the advancement of women in the legal profession.         She graduated on a state scholarship from Hunter College High School at 17. Waiting to meet the age requirement for admission to New York University Law School, she spent a year studying economics, banking and accounting at City College. She took evening classes at N.Y.U. and held a full-time job at Mount Sinai Hospital, keeping records and accounts.         Once she received her law degree in 1922, Mount Sinai doctors helped her practice by steering friends her way. She swiftly established a reputation not only as a skillful lawyer but also as an eloquent friend of the downtrodden, a champion of women's rights and a diligent party worker. She became a Tammany Hall district co-leader on the East Side.         Justice Amsterdam was honored by scores of organizations. "Who's Who of American Women" named her outstanding woman of the year for 1960 in the legal field, citing her "pre-eminent attainments and the inspiration they offer to other women in your profession."         Justice Amsterdam is survived by a sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Judge Milton Sanders, with whom she shared a home on Second Avenue for 59 years, as well as another sister, Sybil Chizner of Hollywood, Fla.         Correction:  July 11, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday of Justice Birdie Amsterdam, the first woman elected to New York State Supreme Court, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Ruth Sanders, not Cynthia.       
         Helen Kushnick, who managed Jay Leno's rise from small-time comic to star of the ''Tonight'' show but was dismissed as the program's executive producer four months after Mr. Leno succeeded Johnny Carson as host, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Jane Rosenthal, a friend. She was 51.         After Mr. Leno took over ''Tonight'' in May 1992, the show received an avalanche of criticism and ratings began to fall. In late September, NBC executives dismissed Ms. Kushnick after she was accused of demanding that guests booked by ''Tonight'' not appear on rival talk shows.         Ms. Kushnick, whose maiden name was Gorman, grew up in Harlem. Her first job was as secretary to the producer David Gerber at 20th Century Fox in New York. She moved to Hollywood with Mr. Gerber and eventually found work at International Creative Management, the talent agency, where she rose from secretary to agent.         In the mid-1970's, she formed a partnership with her husband, Jerrold Kushnick, an entertainment lawyer, and established herself as a manager. Her clients included Mr. Leno, whom she spotted in 1975 at the Comedy Store, Elayne Boosler, Jimmie Walker and for a brief period David Letterman.         Ms. Kushnick's role in Mr. Leno's rise to host of ''The Tonight Show'' was chronicled in ''The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno and the Network Battle for the Night,'' by Bill Carter, a television reporter for The New York Times. In an HBO movie based on the book, the role of Ms. Kushnick was played by Kathy Bates.         Ms. Kushnick, contesting Mr. Carter's version of events, filed a lawsuit for libel, which was settled out of court.         Mr. Kushnick died of cancer seven years ago. The couple had twins, one of whom, Samuel, became infected with the virus that causes AIDS during a blood transfusion and died at age 3 in 1983. Ms. Kushnick became a campaigner in the fight against the disease.         Ms. Kushnick is survived by a daughter, Sara Rose (the other twin), and a brother, Joseph Gorman, of New York City.       
         Helen Wilson Nies, a former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, died on Wednesday, her 71st birthday, at Beebe Hospital in Lewes, Del. She lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was head injuries suffered in a bicycling accident a week earlier in Henlopen Acres, Del., the court said.         President Jimmy Carter named Judge Nies to the United States Customs and Patent Appeals Court in 1980, and President Ronald Reagan reassigned her to the Federal Circuit when that jurisdiction was established in October 1982. She became Chief Judge in June 1990, and served in that post until March 1994. She took senior status last November.         Judge Nies, a native of Birmingham, Ala., graduated from the University of Michigan in 1945 and, three years later, from Michigan Law School. She was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1948 but moved to Washington that year to work at the Justice Department.         She later was a counsel in the Office of Price Stabilization, but took eight years off in the 1950's to rear a family. Before her court appointment, she was a partner in Chicago and Washington law firms.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, John Dirk Nies; two sons, J. Dirk, of Rockville, Md., and Eric W., of New York City; a daughter, Nancy N. Sloan of Las Vegas, Nev.; her mother, Lida Wilson of Rockville; a brother, George E. Wilson, and two grandchildren.       
         Julia Waldbaum, an effervescent personification of motherly concern, homey wisdom and business savvy who helped build a supermarket chain from a butter and egg store in Brooklyn, died in her sleep on Monday as her son held her hand in her apartment in Floral Park, Queens.         Mrs. Waldbaum, 99, who would have turned 100 on July 4, had been a longtime resident of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.         Late in life, even after nearly all her family's stock in the Waldbaum's supermarkets was sold to the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company in 1986, Mrs. Waldbaum  liked to keep an eye on the stores.         In the 1960's, her picture appeared on almost all of the 400 food products sold under the Waldbaum's label, along with recipes she had tested in her own kitchen.         ''They left me off the dog food and the bathroom tissue,'' she observed one day as she made one of her regular surprise inspections as self-appointed watchdog of the chain.         In a store on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, Mrs. Waldbaum, who was also the secretary of the company, told a produce clerk to discard a bruised grapefruit, or put it in with the reduced-price merchandise. She checked at the meat counter to see if anyone had poked through the plastic meat wrappers. ''When that happens, I have it rewrapped,'' she said.         She told how she grew upset when she saw long lines at the checkout counters and not enough checkers, and how she became angry when clerks forgot to say ''thank you'' to customers.         As she continued her tour, one of 30 she made each month, she brushed dust off cans of kidney beans and straightened an untidy display of marshmallows.         ''I'm really not too fussy about messy shelves, though,'' she said. ''That means we're selling.''         By the early 1980's, the chain was grossing $1.376 billion at 140 supermarkets in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. There was never a Manhattan store, she said. ''Manhattan has too many single people, rents are too high and there's no space for parking lots.''         Julia Leffel, the daughter of Harry and Anna Leffel, was born in Manhattan and reared in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. She was 12 when she met Israel Waldbaum. Known as Izzy, he was an immigrant from Austria selling butter and eggs in a little store established in 1904 at 911 DeKalb Avenue.         According to family legend, one day during World War I, Anna Leffel asked Izzy Waldbaum if he could get her some sugar, which was in short supply. Mr. Waldbaum found a 50-pound sack and offered to deliver it personally to her home. When he did, he encountered Julia. He realized that she was the girl who came to his store every day to buy milk, which she carried home in a pail.         In time, Izzy Waldbaum asked to carry the pail home for her. That was their courtship. When he was 28 and she was 21, they married, and Julia went to work in the store.         ''People used to stand three abreast to get into that store,'' she said with a faraway look in her eyes as she reminisced in 1967, 20 years after she was widowed and left with three children.         By the time Mr. Waldbaum died at age 55, the chain consisted of seven stores. When a store ran short of a product, Mrs. Waldbaum, the first woman in her family to have a driver's license, would put her children in the car, drive to a store with a surplus of the product and take some to the needy supermarket.         For years, much to the consternation of her family, she refused to have her telephone number unlisted. ''I like to have the customers call me, because a lot of them think Julia Waldbaum is an imaginary person like Betty Crocker,'' she said.         Away from the supermarkets, Mrs. Waldbaum was devoted to opera and the theater and was a benefactor of many charities.         She is survived by a daughter, Shirley Waldbaum Witkin of Glen Cove, L.I.; a son, Ira Waldbaum of Old Westbury, L.I.; a sister, Sylvia Goldman of Riverdale, the Bronx; a brother, Alfred Leffel of Syosset, L.I., 10 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Lewis Farkas, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1973 after she and her husband, the founder of the Alexander's department stores, contributed $300,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, died on Friday at the Park Avenue home of her son Robin. She was 89.         Mrs. Farkas, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla., had been staying with Mr. Farkas and his wife, Carol, a nurse, in Manhattan since her release two weeks ago from the New York University Medical Center, where she had been treated for a heart ailment.         Despite the uproar that surrounded Mrs. Farkas's appointment and a delay in her Senate confirmation, her posting caused little stir in the tiny grand duchy of Luxembourg, which was accustomed to Americans whose path to ambassadorships was paved with political contributions.         Although Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast his Foreign Relations committee vote against her and denounced her appointment as demeaning the Foreign Service, Senator Gale W. McGee of Wyoming said he was satisfied that Mrs. Farkas was innocent of any impropriety and laughed about the custom of making envoys of people who make generous campaign contributions.         ''The money -- that's par for the course,'' he said. ''It used to be a cheaper price -- but that's Nixon inflation.''         In contrast to Ambassador Perle Mesta, the Washington socialite who arrived in Luxembourg in 1949 with flamboyant ways and gala parties that inspired the Broadway musical ''Call Me Madam,'' Mrs. Farkas, who held a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University and a doctorate in education from New York University, maintained a low profile.         Reserved by nature and press-shy because of the uproar that surrounded her appointment, she was more at ease as the sponsor of forums on the drug problems of teen-agers than in being a second coming of a woman known as the hostess with the mostest.         Not until two years after Mrs. Farkas arrived did she make her first splash in the social life of Luxembourg, with a charity gala that featured the singer Sacha Distel and a United States Army orchestra. The event took in $28,000 for a school for handicapped children.         She maintained close ties with the Government, gave quiet and unpretentious parties and, unlike many envoys, avoided making political statements about United States policy. Most diplomatic work was carried out by her six-member staff, and in the Luxembourg diplomatic community, which then included 13 other ambassadors, Mrs. Farkas, though serious, was not considered a heavyweight.         President Gerald R. Ford accepted her resignation in 1976 and replaced her with Rosemary L. Ginn, a longtime Republican national committeewoman from Missouri.         Mrs. Farkas settled in Florida and resumed her many philanthropic and humanitarian activities and research into male and female roles through the Role Foundation, which she established in 1967.         Ruth Lewis, one of five children of Samuel Lewis and the former Jennie Bach, was born in Manhattan in 1906. Both her parents were in the real estate business and each influenced her. ''Community living and sharing, that was my mother; intellectual pursuits, that was my father,'' Mrs. Farkas once said.         Accompanying her mother into tenements taught her about poverty, and Mrs. Farkas never forgot her mother's advice: ''No matter what your station in life, no matter what you grow up to be, always try to  contribute to those less fortunate than you.''         She met George Farkas when she was 10. Their families lived in the same apartment house, at 107th Street and Fifth Avenue, where George, whose father had died, kept a close eye on his little sister, who was Ruth Lewis's best friend.         ''I didn't like him at first because he was such a boss,'' she said.         They were married in 1928, but not until she graduated from New York University. She received a master's degree from Columbia in 1932 and  was for many years a member of the executive committee of Alexander's.         Mr. Farkas died in 1980.         In addition to Robin, Mrs. Farkas is survived by three other sons, Alexander of Highland Park, Fla., and  Bruce and Jonathan, of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Charlotte H. Dinger, a New Jersey housewife who a paid a chance visit to a Philadelphia antiques shop in 1972 and walked out with the foundation of an unlikely collection and an even less likely career, died on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Morristown, N.J. She was 66, and known as the nation's leading collector and foremost authority on antique carved horses and other carousel art.         Her husband, Carl W. Dinger Jr., said the cause was a heart attack.         To hear her tell it in later years, Mrs. Dinger had two transforming experiences in her life.         The first occurred during a childhood visit to the old Olympic Park in Maplewood, N.J., where she became so enchanted with the flamboyantly beautiful wooden horses whirling around the amusement park's carousel that she promptly announced she wanted one of her own.         The second came on the 1972 visit to the antiques store, where she encountered an old and faded carousel horse that for all its obvious neglect and disrepair evoked such a powerful nostalgic recollection of her bright childhood fascination that she paid $75 for it on the spot.         By the time she got it home and began stripping away the successive layers of thick paint that had obscured the delicate carved features underneath, her old childhood fascination was well on the way to becoming a full-blown adult obsession.         Fired by her initial purchase, Mrs. Dinger soon tracked down what she recognized as a treasure trove of two dozen carousel horses stacked like so much cordwood in a Philadelphia warehouse. Their next stop was the Dinger garage.         (It's a safe bet that there aren't many such warehouse troves left. By the time Mrs. Dinger was in full swing, figures stripped from the thousands of carousels that operated  at the turn of the century were recognized as valuable examples of a neglected art.)         Her husband, only mildly irritated at the loss of space for the family cars, could hardly complain. He, too, was a collector, but then again his collection of baseball cards did not require repeated additions to the couple's Morristown home.         Over the next two decades Mrs. Dinger tracked down, bought and restored scores of horses and other carousel figures. She became familiar with the history of the American carousel, from its beginnings in 1867 with the work of a German immigrant, Gustav Dentzel, to its decline after the introduction of the automobile and its abrupt demise in the Depression.         She became an expert in the subtle distinctions of the work of such carousel masters as Charles Loof (known for friendly, smiling steeds) and Sol Stein and Harry Goldstein (the Central Park Carousel).         She helped found the American Carousel Society to spread the word among other collectors and carousel lovers. She started her own publishing company to produce a definitive coffee table book, ''Art of the Carousel.''         When her collection threatened to outstrip the capacity of her home, she put together a traveling exhibition that was displayed at museums across the country.         As other collectors, recognizing that antique carousel figures were not merely curiosities or so much junk but examples of an important American folk art, bid up the prices of choice specimens to astronomical levels (as much as $175,000), she became a consultant to Sotheby's.         And finally, concerned about the wear and tear of constant travel on her own increasingly valuable figures, she established a permanent home for more than 100 of her best pieces at Carousel World, a museum and working carousel she helped establish at Peddler's Village in Lahaska, Pa., outside New Hope.         Anyone who hasn't seen them there may have caught a glimpse of a few of her prize pieces in the family mail. The United States Postal Service has twice used Mrs. Dinger's collection as the basis for an issue of commemorative stamps depicting carousel animals.         Despite her interest in collecting individual carousel figures, Mrs. Dinger campaigned to keep the dwindling supply of working carousels intact. (According to the American Carousel Society, which estimates there were once 3,000 to 6,000 carousels in the country, from the famous Flying Horses on Martha's Vineyard, where children still ride on the oldest American carousel, assembled in 1884, to the last carousels produced in the 1920's, there are now only 133 left.)         And all her instincts as a collector and her appreciation of carousels and carousel figures as art, Mrs. Dinger never forgot her initial childhood fascination with the fairy tale experience of whirling around on a noble horse.         During her many visits to carousels across the country, Mrs. Dinger was never content just to look. She always climbed aboard and took a ride.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Carl Dinger 3d of Sugarland Tex., and Jeff, of Morris Plains, N.J., and two granddaughters.       
         Jessie Bernard, a sociologist whose wide-ranging research and writings on women's issues provided scholarly foundation for the modern feminist revolution, died on Oct. 6 at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93.         By rights, Dr. Bernard should have been content to observe the reawakening of feminism benignly from the far side of a long and completed career.         Indeed, when Betty Friedan revived feminist fervor with the publication of her landmark ''Feminine Mystique'' in 1963, Dr. Bernard was a 60-year-old Penn State professor a year away from retirement. And, with the exception of ''Academic Women,'' a 1961 work derived from her own experiences in academia, the dozen or so works on subjects like community organization that had gained her reputation as a respected scholar seemed remote from the suddenly urgent issues raised by the Friedan treatise.         But like many professional women of a certain age who had balanced a successful career with marriage and motherhood, Dr. Bernard came to the realization that she had been a feminist all along and, as it turned out, had a lot to say on the subject.         So much so, in fact, that within a decade after her formal retirement in 1964 she had turned out a torrent of books -- among them ''The Sex Game,'' ''The Female World,'' ''The Future of Marriage'' and ''The Future of Motherhood'' -- that established her as a premier scholar of the women's movement.         It is in part a tribute to her scholarship that many of the ideas she advanced, like the notion that marriage generally benefits men more than women, seem commonplace today.         Although her works were based on meticulous research, as a feminist scholar Dr. Bernard had an edge. For when it came to writing about women as wives, mothers and breadwinners, she had not only been there and done that, she had also done it with uncommon flair.         On the surface, she had led the most conventional of lives. The daughter of immigrant shopkeepers from Romania, Dr. Bernard, whose original name was Ravitch, was born in Minneapolis, attended the University of Minnesota, married her college sweetheart and followed her husband from job to job, serving variously as his assistant and collaborator while holding a series of lower-level jobs, and not beginning her own academic career in earnest until she was in her 40's, an age when a woman's children are generally old enough to fend for themselves.         But surfaces can be deceiving, and there was very little conventional about Dr. Bernard.         For one thing, the college sweetheart she married was not a classmate, but one of her professors, Dr. Luther Lee Bernard, a founder of the modern study of sociology and a man more than twice her age when they met in a classroom and felt such a powerful mutual attraction that neither looked back.         She then accelerated her education, graduating at 20 and receiving a master's degree the next year. After marrying her professor she began a peripatetic life, following him band from academic post to post, including a sojourn to Argentina, where she helped him with the research that would win him wide acclaim.         Dr. Bernard did not obtain her own doctorate, from Washington University in St. Louis, until she was 32, and did not begin her teaching career, at the Lindewood College for Women, near St. Louis, until she was 37.         Then, at a time when many women's children are beginning to leave home, Dr. Bernard started having children, the first when she was 39, another when she was 42 and the last when she was 47, three years after she and her husband had joined the Penn State faculty and six months before his death at the age of 69.         By the time she retired from Penn State and began writing about women's issues, Dr. Bernard knew what it meant to be both a wife and a single mother.         She moved her family to Washington and became a central figure in the feminist revolution, studying subtle forms of sex discrimination as scholar in residence for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, for example, and becoming a founding board member for the Center for Women in Policy Studies.         In her later years Dr. Bernard, who was known for her beaming smile and generosity in helping younger scholars, exerted a magnetic attraction at conferences and other gatherings, her colleagues at the center said, and was regarded by some scholars as a founding mother of sociology.         Dr. Bernard is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Jackson of Washington; two sons, Claude, of Laurel, Md., and David, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Former Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota, a fierce champion of family farms, medical research and campaign finance reform and the creator of Federal student loans, died at a nursing home in Edina, Minn., on Thursday, her legislative achievements all but overshadowed by her vindictive husband's ''Coya, Come Home'' campaign that led to her defeat after two terms in 1958. She was 82.         Her son, Terry, said the cause was kidney failure.         If there had ever been any doubts that a woman's place is in the House, they must surely have been dispelled in 1954 when the former Coya Gjesdal unseated a six-term Republican and swept into Congress like a whirlwind from northern Minnesota.         There had been women in Congress continuously for more than 30 years, and Mrs. Knutson, although the first from Minnesota, was one of seven elected in 1954. But it is safe to say that the House had never seen anything quite like her.         A Norwegian immigrant's daughter who grew up on a North Dakota farm, graduated from Concordia College in 1934 and spent a year studying voice and piano at the Juilliard School before returning to North Dakota to teach school, she married in 1940 and settled in the little town of Oklee, Minn., just across the state line.         She and her husband operated a small hotel cum cafe until Mrs. Knutson, a populist inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt, got the political bug and made a successful run for the Minnesota Legislature in 1950.         A tireless campaigner who accompanied herself on the accordion while singing her own campaign song in a lilting soprano, she stunned the Minnesota political establishment when she won the 1954 Congressional election, and when she got to Washington she stunned Congress even more.         Despite her lack of seniority, Mrs. Knutson promptly won a place on the House Agriculture Committee. She subsequently initiated the first Federal appropriations for cystic fibrosis research, introduced the first bill calling for the income tax checkoff to finance Presidential election campaigns and originated the idea and the legislation that established the Federal student loan program.         Mrs. Knutson was an independent-minded woman, and she made her share of political enemies along the way. But, despite opposition from some leaders of her own Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, she appeared headed for a long and brilliant career in Congress as her second term drew to a close.         Then, in May 1958, when her party declined to formally endorse Mrs. Knutson for a third term, forcing her to run in a primary to seek re-election, Andy Knutson, the farmhand she had married 18 years earlier, dropped a bombshell.         In an open letter to his wife, he urged her to leave Congress and return to what he described as the ''happy home we once enjoyed.''         Never mind that Mr. Knutson, who had once worked on her father's farm in North Dakota, had not shared a bedroom with his wife for years or that he had regularly beaten her so badly during her visits to Minnesota, as their son later recalled it, that she had to wear dark glasses to hide her black eyes from her fellow members of Congress.         Once the resulting ''Coya, Come Home,'' newspaper headline was carried across the country, it created a firestorm of publicity that accepted Mr. Knutson's story as the plaintive truth and portrayed his wife as an uncaring wife who had abandoned her family for political ambition.         Mr. Knutson later stirred the fire by accusing his wife of having an affair with a legislative aide half her age, but although the charge was a blatant fabrication, Mrs. Knutson refused to denounce her husband.         She managed to win the primary, but lost the general election by 1,390 votes to Odin Langen, a Republican who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and campaigned on the slogan, ''A Big Man for a Man-Sized Job.'' There was never any doubt that the ''Coya, Come Home,'' campaign had cost Mrs. Knutson the election, and as it turned out, her political career.         She failed in a comeback bid in 1960, divorced her husband in 1962, and then spent a dozen years working in the Defense Department in Washington before trying another abortive race in 1977, polling 13 percent of the vote in a primary in which one of her opponents was her former legislative aide.         According to her son, who was adopted when he was 8 over the objections of his father, Mrs. Knutson, a deeply religious woman who frequently cited the biblical passage, ''Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord,'' never expressed bitterness toward her husband.         But she was also apparently content to leave forgiveness to the Lord. When Mr. Knutson died of acute alcohol poisoning in 1969, she did not attend his funeral.         Besides her son, of Bloomington, Minn., Mrs. Knutson is survived by two sisters, Helen Riets of Devil's Lake, N.D., and Crystal Greguson of Edina, two grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Irma Ullmann, the matriarch of a New York philanthropic family, died on Nov. 4 at White Plains Hospital while staying with family in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 91 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla., since moving from Manhattan more than 30 years ago.         Working through the Ullmann Family Foundation, she carried on the work she began with her husband, Siegfried Ullmann, a Wall Street commodities trader, supporting educational and medical institutions here and in Israel. Centers and projects they sponsored in both countries bear their name.         Among the chief beneficiaries were Yeshiva University and its Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where she was a board member of the national women's division. The Ullmanns established the college's Research Center for Health Sciences and a chair in molecular genetics.         At the American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, she was a principal supporter of scientific and technological research at the institute in Haifa. The Ullman Teaching Center serves undergraduates and Technion's 19 faculty departments, and family funds sustained an Ullmann Robotics Center, along with scholarships, dormitories and laboratories.         The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel was a beneficiary from its beginning, and she left her stamp on its Ullmann Institute of Life Sciences, the Ullmann Gallery at Weizmann, to which she contributed art from her private collection, and an Ullmann Professorial Chair.         Other major recipients included UJA-Federation of New York and the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. The Lichtenstadter Hospital for the Chronically Ill in Israel was established in memory of her parents, Jakob and Flora Lichtenstadter.         Mrs. Ullmann is survived by a son, Dr. Leonard P. Ullmann of Incline Village, Nev., five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Her husband of 40 years, Siegfried, a founder and former president of the international metals and commodities trading firm of Philipp Brothers, died in 1966.       
         Alma Kitchell, a pioneering radio singer who became a pioneering talk show host, sang in the first televised opera and capped her career by presiding over the first television cooking show, died on Wednesday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 103.         She was known as the Golden Voice of the Golden Age of radio, and from the time she walked into NBC's old New York station, WJZ, in 1927 and sang her way into a job, her rich contralto was rarely silent for the next two decades.         After singing regularly on the local station for a year, she moved up to NBC's old Blue network, spending two years with the NBC Opera Company and five years as the soloist on a weekly program with the NBC concert orchestra before increasing her schedule to three nights a week for a seven-year run.         By the time she abandoned broadcast singing in 1940, Miss Kitchell had embarked on a new phase of her vocal career, as the originator and host of a series of talk shows devoted to women's concerns. Her program and Mary Margaret McBride's, which ran on NBC's Red network, are regarded as the first radio talk shows.         Under names like ''Let's Talk It Over,'' ''Women's Exchange,'' and ''Alma Kitchell's Brief Case,'' in which she answered her voluminous mail, the programs were broadcast from 1938 to 1947, initially on NBC and later on ABC, the network organized in 1943 to take over NBC's Blue network.         Along the way, Miss Kitchell interviewed prominent women like Eleanor Roosevelt, discussed family and social issues and chatted about her own active life.         For all the fans she acquired as a singer, Miss Kitchell became even more famous as a talk show host, and she put her celebrity to civic use, especially during World War II. She once sang on the air while giving blood, for example, and she conceived of and popularized the slogan ''A Stamp a Day for the Man Who's Away'' to help sell war bonds.         A formidable woman on or off the air, Miss Kitchell, who had been sent on cross-country speaking tours by NBC to promote radio, became an important fund-raiser for the Republican Party in New York and was named to state commissions by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey.         A native of Superior, Wis., Miss Kitchell, whose maiden name was Hopkins, began singing locally. She studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory and came to New York in 1912 at the age of 19 to pursue a professional career.         According to family legend, she was chaperoned by her mother during her first year in New York, spent the second year on her own and in the third married her voice teacher, Charles W. Kitchell.         She began by singing with major local choral societies and orchestras, and made her debut at Town Hall in 1924 in a program that included Bach and Handel airs, Swiss and Jewish folksongs and modern French, German and Russian songs with American lyrics.         By the time she began her radio career in 1927, Miss Kitchell had already established her credentials as a broadcast pioneer. In 1917, six years before regular broadcasts were begun, she sang for an experimental station established at the base of the Statue of Liberty.         For all her devotion to music, Miss Kitchell came to love radio more. In 1937, she turned down an opportunity to join the Metropolitan Opera in order to stay in broadcasting.         Although she was primarily known for her work in radio, Miss Kitchell was a pioneer in television as well. In 1939, when RCA began the first experimental television broadcasts from its Rockefeller Center headquarters, she sang the part of Ruth, the piratical maid of all work, in the first televised opera, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance.''         Eight years later, at the dawn of network television in 1947, Miss Kitchell abandoned her radio career and ABC to return to NBC and make television history once again, this time as the star of the first commercial network television series, also  television's first cooking show, ''In the Kelvinator Kitchen.''         She remained on the program until 1949, then retired from public life.         Miss Kitchell, whose first husband died in 1956, married Joseph Yoder, a retired chemical engineer, in 1965 and settled in Florida. Mr. Yoder died about a decade ago.         Miss Kitchell remained in vigorous health until her 100th birthday. It was an occasion noted by Willard Scott, the ''Today'' weatherman, from NBC's studios in the same building where she had helped open the television era a half-century earlier.         She is survived by two sons,  Charles Kitchell of Osterville, Mass.,  and James Kitchell of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and four great-grandhildren.       
         Nancy Macdonald, the well-born anarchist who helped radicalize her husband, Dwight Macdonald, in the 1930's, managed his magazine Politics in the 1940's, and then struck out on her own in the 1950's to aid refugees of the Spanish civil war, died last Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 86 and had lived on East 10th Street for more than half a century.         Her son Nicholas said the cause was emphysema.         The darlings of New York's radicals in the 1930's were the half million Spanish loyalists who fought in vain against the forces of Francisco Franco, then made their way across the Pyrenees to refuge in southwestern France.         The loyalists got a lot of attention at the beginning, and those who had been Communists continued to receive support, but by the 1950's, with Franco's fascist dictatorship well established, the others had become what Mrs. Macdonald called ''the legion of the forgotten,'' languishing in poverty, unable and unwilling to return to their homeland.         It was then that Mrs. Macdonald decided to remind the world of their plight. In 1953 she founded Spanish Refugee Aid to provide help to the non-Communist exiles.         From her office on Union Square, Mrs. Macdonald attracted money and support from intellectual friends like Hannah Arendt, James T. Farrell, Alfred Kazin and Barbara Tuchman, while Pablo Casals and Francine Faure, the wife of Albert Camus, distributed the aid in France.         And her home, which had been a literary and political social center in the 1930's, was hopping once again. Where T. S. Eliot had once been among the lionized guests, Alexander Calder mingled with refugees.         There was, to be sure, one change on East 10th Street. Mr. Macdonald, who had helped establish the aid organization, was no longer around as the marriage had dissolved.         On paper, at least, the union between Dwight Macdonald and Nancy Gardiner Rodman seemed made in establishment heaven. He was Yale, she was Vassar, and both were descended from prominent families, he from the Dwights of old New England, she from the Gardiners of colonial New York.         When her brother, Selden Rodman, a poet and prominent art collector, introduced them at a party, she, the daughter of a New York architect, was fresh out of college, and he was a writer for Fortune magazine.         For all their social and establishment credentials, both had left-wing views. In his years as a founding editor of Partisan Review in the 1930's, as the founder of Politics in the 1940's and later as a social critic for The New Yorker, Mr. Macdonald acknowledged that his wife had prodded him ever leftward.         It was also her family money that enabled him to leave Fortune for The Partisan Review, where she worked as business manager. And it was her administrative skills as managing editor that helped keep Politics going  after the couple established it in their apartment in 1943.         While her husband was securing his reputation as a major critic, Mrs. Macdonald was becoming known for her intellectual fervor and for what Mr. Kazin recalled as her abiding kindness and concern for others.         Mrs. Macdonald, who peppered The New York Times and other publications with letters and articles describing the plight of the refugees, even after the death of Franco in 1974, continued to direct Spanish Refugee Aid until retiring in 1983, then summed up her work with a book in 1987 based on taped interviews, ''Homage to the Spanish Exiles: Voices from the Spanish Civil War.''         With the time and the restoration of democracy in Spain, the number of exiles has declined, but there are still 125 aging loyalists receiving help from the charity. According to the director, Margaret Childress, because of Mrs. Macdonald's financial efforts, the help will continue.         Mr. Macdonald died in 1982. In addition to her son Nicholas, of Brooklyn, and her brother of Oakland, N.J., Mrs. Macdonald is survived by another son, Michael of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great grandchild.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Monday about Nancy Macdonald, who aided refugees of the Spanish Civil War, misstated the year of Francisco Franco's death. It was 1975, not 1974.       
         Joan Hartman-Goldsmith, an art historian and writer known for her expertise in Chinese works, especially jade, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         At her death Mrs. Goldsmith was the director of the Institute for Asian Studies on East 44th Street, which she founded in 1981 as a school for adult education. Its lecture programs cover a wide range of historical and contemporary subjects pertaining to Asia.         She also was a member of the art committee of the China Institute in America, which has its headquarters on East 65th Street. She established the institute's art gallery and helped in its work for nearly three decades.         She contributed numerous articles and book reviews to art publications and also wrote about jade and Chinese art for the general reader. Her most recent book was ''Chinese Jade,'' published in 1986 by Oxford University Press in Hong Kong.         Born Joan Lederman in Malden, Mass., she graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan. She studied Chinese art on her own for 10 years and started a career at the China Institute and the School for Continuing Education at New York University. In the 1970's she worked as an administrator at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan.         Mrs. Goldsmith made 13 trips to China, most recently in June. She lectured at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Design as well as other museums and institutes across the country and abroad.         A marriage to Alan Hartman ended in divorce.         Mrs. Goldsmith is survived by her husband, Robert L. Goldsmith; a daughter, Hedy Hartman of St. George, S.I.; and a sister, Louisa Lubar of Newton Centre, Mass.       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Helen Weil Benjamin, a longtime benefactor of the Mount Sinai Medical Center  and the Whitney Museum of American Art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Benjamin was a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital from 1954 to 1979. A volunteer for the Mount Sinai Hospital Auxiliary Board from 1927 to 1991, she served as president for five of those years and was a founder of the hospital gift shop. She also established the Mrs. Robert M. Benjamin Educational Fund to  provide summer fellowships in gerontological social work.         She and her husband, a corporate lawyer, developed an interest in contemporary art that led to her involvement with the Whitney Museum. She served as a member of its Painting and Sculpture Committee from 1978 to 1989.         She was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Vassar College in 1925.         Mrs. Benjamin is survived by a daughter, Mary B. Arnstein of Hamden, Conn.; two sons, Robert M. Jr., of Manhattan and Stephen, of Santa Fe, N.M., seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Freeman Meyer, a philanthropist who attended Syracuse University's School of Management and remained a booster her whole life, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, she was 93.         Mrs. Meyer, who was born in Syracuse, upheld the notion that education makes  a difference in a young person's life by providing some of the financial wherewithal for it. She contributed to Syracuse University for decades, and in 1968 she established the Herbert and Ruth Meyer Endowment Scholarship Fund.         Steadily replenished, the fund has grown to $1.9 million and ranks among the largest individially financed scholarship programs at Syracuse. It provides full tuition, renewable for three years, for promising students from the New York City region, regardless of major.         She was on the board of the Council of Jewish Women and kept a continuing interest in the 92d Street Y.M.H.A. Fund. She also belonged to the Committee of  a Thousand, a support group active at Mount Sinai Hospital.         Mrs. Meyer's husband, Herbert, a New York businessman, died in 1968.       
         Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, an author, musicologist and composer, died yesterday of a heart attack in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., where she was being treated for a broken hip. She was 86 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.         The oldest daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, Dr. Eisenstein was the first woman to have  a bat mitzvah, in 1922.         No thunder sounded," she said in 1992, recalling the ceremony. "No lightning struck."         But opening to women the bar mitzvah rite that had long marked the passage of Jewish males into religious adulthood proved to be the first of many changes broadening the role of women in Judaism, including in recent years their ordination as rabbis.         Today the bat mitzvah ceremony, usually carried out when girls are 12, is an  established practice within the Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism, and parallel celebrations are common in some quarters of Orthodox Judaism as well.         From 1929 to 1954, Dr. Eisenstein taught music education and the history of Jewish music at Jewish Theological Seminary's Teacher's Institute, now known as  the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies in Manhattan.         While there she published a Jewish songbook for children, "Gateway to Jewish  Song," which was followed by other books of Jewish music and musical history for young people.  From 1942 to 1974, she wrote seven cantatas on Jewish themes, among them the frequently performed, "What Is Torah," which she wrote with her husband, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein.         In 1959, at the age of 50, Dr. Eisenstein, who had earned a master's degree in music education at Columbia University's Teachers College, began work for her Ph.D. at the School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in New York. After receiving her degree, she taught there from 1966 to  1979, teaching as well at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia.         The smallest branch of Judaism, Reconstructionism views Judaism as what Dr. Eisenstein's father, Rabbi Kaplan, called the "evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people," emphasizing the cultural and moral heritage of the Jewish people but not traditional supernatural and theistic beliefs.         Dr. Eisenstein, who was born on Sept. 10, 1909, studied at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. An early marriage ended in divorce and in 1934 she married Rabbi Eisenstein, the assistant rabbi at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Manhattan synagogue that her father headed.         She collaborated with her husband on five of her cantatas. In February 1952,  on the eve of a Jewish Music Festival in New York, Dr. Eisenstein defended the idea of a distinctive Jewish music. While Jews had borrowed much musically from  the nations and peoples they had lived among, she wrote in The New York Times, the music of Jews "bears the unmistakable stamp of their own peculiar wistfulness, puritanism, or wry humor."         When she was 82, 12 years past the biblical life span of 70, Dr. Eisenstein had a second bat mitzvah, at which she was also honored by feminist and Jewish leaders, including Betty Friedan, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ruth W. Messinger, Elizabeth Holtzman, Rabbi Rachel Cowan and Blu Greenberg.         At that time, Dr. Eistenstein expressed disappointment that bat mitzvah ceremonies, like bar mitzvahs, were often overshadowed by lavish parties. "Bat mitzvah began not just as a statement of feminism," she said, "but as a statement of dedication to something larger than oneself."         In addition to her husband, Dr. Eisenstein is survived by two daughters, Miriam Eisenstein of Gaithersburg, Md., and Ann Eisenstein of Manhattan; three sisters, Hadassah Musher and Selma Goldman, both of Manhattan, and Naomi Wenner  of Chevy Chase, Md., and one grandchild.
