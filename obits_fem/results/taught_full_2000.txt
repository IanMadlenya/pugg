         Hsieh Ping-ying, a Chinese feminist author known for her autobiographical work, died on Jan. 5 in San Francisco. She was 93.         Miss Hsieh moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970's from Taiwan, to which she had fled from mainland China in 1949.         Miss Hsieh ''pioneered the literary construction of a soldier image for women -- as imaginative as it may have been -- and thereby influenced this kind of literature in China for decades,'' said Charles A. Laughlin,  professor of modern Chinese literature at Yale University.         Her first book was ''War Diary,''  published in 1928 in Shanghai. Dr. Laughlin recalled that, in writing the book, Miss Hsieh accompanied soldiers of the Chinese Nationalist army in 1926 and 1927, when it was trying to bring warlords in the eastern half of China under control and while she was a ''girl soldier'' with propaganda training.         ''At a time when Chinese women were trying to find new modes of identity in the 20th century after having shed the shackles of traditional Chinese feminine identity, there were many different, alternative identities available to them,'' Dr. Laughlin said, ''and I think she was the first to create this very military one.''         A scholar's daughter, Miss Hsieh was born in a village in Hunan province. Before she was 20, she enrolled in the Wuchang Central Political and Military School. The academy trained young women to be uniformed propagandists attached to the regular military.         After her relatively brief military service Miss Hsieh returned to her village and an arranged marriage. In 1940 her book ''Girl Rebel: The Autobiography of Hsieh Pingying'' was published in the United States.         After her marriage ended, Ms. Hsieh was charged with being a Communist and radical and was imprisoned. After her release she studied Chinese literature and worked as a roving writer, editor and teacher. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, she again became a ''girl soldier,'' accompanying Chinese combat troops to the front. Diary entries about her experiences appeared in newspapers and in another book. After World War II she escaped to Taiwan, where she taught and wrote.         Her second husband, Earl Chia,  died in 1988. The couple became American citizens after moving to San Francisco. She is survived by a daughter, Lily Chia Brissman of Nacogdoches, Tex.; two sons, Luke, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Wen, of Ambler, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Victoria A. Fromkin, an internationally renowned linguist who gathered the flotsam of human discourse -- slips of the tongue, mishearings and other speech errors -- and used it to illuminate the way in which language is organized in the mind, died on Jan. 19 in Los Angeles. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said officials at the University of California at Los Angeles, where Dr. Fromkin, an emeritus professor of linguistics, had taught since 1965.         In addition to publishing many articles on psycholinguistics, Dr. Fromkin and Robert Rodman wrote ''An Introduction to Language'' (Harcourt Brace), now in its sixth edition and regarded as the seminal undergraduate textbook in the field.         As Dr. Fromkin was gleefully aware, everyday speech contains many a slip 'twixt the brain and the lip. While earlier scholars had noted the theoretical usefulness of these errors, she was the first to gather them in quantity, colleagues said, building a collection of linguistic inadvertencies like spoonerisms (''speech production'' coming out as ''preach seduction''), semantic substitutions (''That's a horse of a different race'') and slips of the ear (''All of the members of the group grew up in Philadelphia'' heard as ''All of the members of the group threw up in Philadelphia'').         To know Dr. Fromkin was to be accustomed to having every verbal lapse transcribed for scientific posterity in a notebook she carried.         Dr. Fromkin used the collection, which grew to more than 10,000 examples, to offer evidence of the unconscious knowledge of language structure that people draw on whenever they speak.         A person who means to say ''bridge of the nose'' but says ''bridge of the neck'' instead, she explained, was furnishing concrete, if unwitting, evidence that the words ''nose'' and ''neck'' are stored near each other in some sort of mental lexicon.         Dr. Fromkin was born Victoria Alexandra Landish in Passaic, N.J., on May 16, 1923. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1944. She married Jack Fromkin in 1948. A son, Mark, died in an automobile accident at age 16.         Returning to school in her late 30's to study linguistics, Dr. Fromkin received a master's degree from U.C.L.A. in 1963 and a Ph.D. from the same institution in 1965. She joined the faculty that year.         From 1980 to 1989, she was vice chancellor of graduate programs at U.C.L.A., one of the first women in the University of California system to hold such a position.         She was a past president of the Linguistic Society of America. Dr. Fromkin is survived by her husband.         ''We all produce slips of the tongue,'' Dr. Fromkin wrote in 1980. ''And those of us trying to understand the nature of language and language use are grateful for this fact.''       
         Anne Devenney, the spark plug of community organization who helped keep the tidy, solid neighborhoods of the northwest Bronx from turning into another burned-out urban slum, died Jan. 9 in the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A former resident of Norwood, the Bronx, she recently lived with her daughters in Yonkers.         Mrs. Devenney was a founder, president emeritus and living legend of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, which started in the mid-1970's. An umbrella organization for nine community groups, it champions home ownership, tenant-controlled housing, street safety and local investment.         ''She was a no-nonsense Bronx grandmother who took leadership of a whole part of the Bronx in some of its darkest times as the head of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition,'' said the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who had known her for some 20 years. ''She led the charge against arson for profit, housing deterioration and unresponsive politicians. She was a real original.''         At times, it seemed that her coalition was fighting sluggish bureaucracies and corporate obtuseness as much as the obvious symptoms of urban blight. It took on the problems of drug dealing, street crime, vacant buildings and the flight of residents that those things would set off, but it also attacked mortgage redlining and the deterioration of city services.         Anne O'Hanlon was a child of the Depression, the youngest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents in Hell's Kitchen, on the West Side of Manhattan. She lived in tenements there, in Harlem and in Morningside Heights. As a teenager, she washed and ironed and scrubbed floors for the well-to-do on Riverside Drive for $1.25 a day.         She dropped out of high school and got a $12-a-week dime-store job, but returned to night classes to earn a high school diploma. A defining experience of her youth was the eviction of her family from their apartment house, which was demolished to make room for a ramp to the George Washington Bridge.         In 1941, she married John Devenney, and in 1956, the couple moved to Putnam Valley, N.Y., from which Mr. Devenney commuted to his draftsman's job in New York City. But the suburbs were not her natural habitat, and Mrs. Devenney later said that she hated being dependent on a car and that all the rain and snow and hard mud for months on end made her long for the swept pavements of the city.         In 1962, the family moved back to the Bronx into a fifth-floor five-room apartment on Perry Avenue, but in a few years, the ailments of the inner city moved into the neighborhood. Black and Hispanic refugees from the South Bronx moved in, with the causes of their flight in pursuit.         Landlords, frightened by the wave of arson sweeping the borough, began to neglect their buildings and even abandon them. Many white working-class families started to think of moving to other places for a haven. But Mrs. Devenney's upbringing among people of different races and creeds had taught her that the struggle against community destruction knew no color.         Banding together with members of the clergy and young community organizers, she began to haunt hallways and community centers, trying to shake people out of their complacency and into partnerships with residents of surrounding areas where the blight was setting in.         The result was the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. It and its affiliated groups badgered city officials for decent sanitation services and the money to keep streets, parks and other public places in good repair. They trooped to City Hall, demanding action against landlords who burned their buildings for the insurance money.         They homed in on redlining by insurers that refused to write policies in their neighborhoods for fear of losses and by banks that denied mortgages in the community despite the large amounts of deposits that they held from its residents.         Coalition members picketed corporate headquarters, invaded annual meetings with proxies from stock-owning churches, and met personally with politicians and executives who knew little of the people living in those communities.         Mrs. Devenney's husband died in 1993.         She is survived by two daughters, Betty Devenney and Carol Gibney, both of Yonkers; two sons, John, of Macon, Ga., and Joseph, of Mahopac, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Devenney stayed in the forefront of the campaign for neighborhood survival until the late 1980's, negotiating with commissioners, mayors and banking and insurance executives for a fair share of city services and private-sector investment.         She described herself as ''conservative-liberal-radical,'' explaining, ''I have to be conservative because I want to conserve my neighborhood, liberal to keep my mind open and radical to carry a picket sign.''       
         Frances Messersmith Miner, who for 43 years nurtured tulips, radishes and children at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, died Monday in Utica, N.Y., her brother said. She was 94 and lived in a nursing home in nearby Clinton.         Miss Miner learned of the Brooklyn children's garden, the first to be included within a scientific botanic garden, as a freshman at Smith College when her botany professor mentioned it. She made a note that that was ''something I'd like to do.''         Seven years later, in 1930, she began working at the children's garden under the tutelage of its founder, Ellen Eddy Shaw, who began it in 1914 on a single acre of the 52-acre Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         Miss Miner, tall, slender and less frail than she seemed, looked as if she belonged in a garden: she favored straw hats and print dresses.         She relished getting down on her hands and knees to weed at a time when not many women did. Her title was curator of instruction, but she was called ''the botanic lady'' by generations of youngsters, some of whom were inspired to become influential gardeners as adults.         ''To me, she seemed to know everything,'' said Helen Mattin, who almost seven decades ago began crossing Washington Avenue as an 8-year-old to take classes and is now a major benefactor to the garden. ''It was great to be with someone who just poured out love to me.''         Scott Appell, who started gardening at 9 in 1963 and is now educational director at the Horticultural Society of New York, emphasized that Miss Miner provided much more than engaging baby-sitting. There were written tests, badges and medals for high achievement. Well-kept children's plots were marked with signs with a white star on a green background; those needing work got a sign with a blue question mark.         ''When we went to class on Saturday, it was just like being in school,'' he said. ''It was not informal at all. It was very hard. We were taught a sense of responsibility.''         A tangible example of the responsibility Miss Miner demanded was the care of gardening tools. Hoes, rakes and trowels dating back more than 80 years can be seen gleaming on the racks of the Children's Garden House, which last year was refurbished and named for Miss Miner.         Once, when tomato stakes needed painting, she bought green paint and asked the children to do it. Naturally, everybody went home green, but ''she knew that if the children painted the stakes, they would take better care of them,'' said Daphne Welch Day, a longtime colleague.         Miss Miner summed up her approach in a publication for the Brooklyn garden. ''I believe that students, especially beginners in this adventure, should be participants rather than spectators,'' she wrote. ''A feeling of ownership and a sense of responsibility for the care of a plant 'pet' elicit an entirely different kind of response than viewing displays of plants, no matter how spectacular.''         Miss Miner was born in Plainfield, N.J., and grew up in Oriskany Falls, N.Y. After graduating from Smith, she worked briefly with the Girl Scouts in Elmira, N.Y., then accepted a post at the Brooklyn garden as an educational assistant.         Friends quickly came to appreciate her sometimes quirky approach. She liked to be known by her initials, FMM. Each day she would jot notes on the subway to and from her home on 110th Street in Manhattan. They would be daily distributed to ''DW,'' ''AB,'' and her other colleagues.         She is survived by her brother Charles of Oriskany Falls.         In addition to writing about botanical topics for publications like the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society in England, she wrote a 95-page children's book called ''The Adventure Book of Growing Plants.''         Her joy was seeing a child learn a  lesson about plants. She wrote of a boy named Johnny who despaired because his plants were thriving and healthy but lacked tomatoes. It turned out that Johnny was meticulously picking off the blossoms, which he called ''old yellow flowers.''         ''Johnny learned the hard way that a blossom is necessary to fruit production and that fruits lead to seed which in turn lead to new plants and more flowers,'' she wrote. ''Johnny took home more than tomatoes.''       
         Anna Holbrook Clark, who transcended a secretarial job to become an influential policy adviser to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and worked at five levels of government, died on Jan. 28 in a Manhattan nursing home. She was 95.         The era in which Ms. Clark served the dynamic mayor known as ''the Little Flower'' seems almost impossibly quaint: he had no telephone on his desk and wandered into her cubbyhole to take calls. But it was the Depression era, and as the country moved toward World War II she was at the center of events during a turbulent period at City Hall.         ''I do not think that anyone who stops to consider it can deny that we are in the midst of a social revolution,'' Ms. Clark said in a paper on economic strategies written for Mayor La Guardia in 1940. She saw the mayor's office as ''one of the nerve centers of the world,'' according to an oral history she prepared in the 1980's.         The pace of life -- eventually as secretary of the Board of Estimate, the panel of top elected officials that then ran city government -- was blistering: Mayor La Guardia resented staff members taking lunch, barely tolerated their vacations and routinely punished unproductive commissioners by making them wait five or six hours for appointments.         Ms. Clark was one of dozens of women promoted by Mayor La Guardia to positions of influence as part of his reformist philosophy. She eventually held jobs at the city, county, state, federal and international levels. Her approach to her often-chaotic working environment was steady, soft-spoken and utterly attentive.         ''You told her something once,'' said Susan Alt, former president of the Women's Civic Club, a policy analysis and advocacy organization of which Ms. Clark was a member throughout her adult life.         Ms. Clark possessed a steely determination learned from her grandmother Kate, a suffragist and prohibitionist who frequently campaigned on street corners.         Women won the right to vote when Ms. Clark was 16. Her mother took her along to the polling place even though she was too young to vote. Smiling broadly, the mother told officials that her daughter was 21 -- a bit of calculated revenge for centuries of female disenfranchisement.         Anna Clark was born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights in 1904. She was the oldest of five children. One sister contracted polio and another died of influenza in 1918, leaving a long shadow over the family, said a niece, Cheryl Chalmers.         But spirited discussions of public affairs obscured the sadness. Talk often revolved around corruption cases that her father, John Kirkland Clark, investigated as a lawyer in the Manhattan district attorney's office.         Ms. Clark attended the Barnard School for Girls, but she later regretted that the school taught her little science. She graduated from Smith College, majoring in government. Her first job was with a magazine published for social workers.         She then received a one-year fellowship to Bryn Mawr College to study bias in the news. Her next job was as a writer for The American City, a technical journal for city government managers. She was laid off during the Depression.         ''I remember saying to my family that I thought if I were a man I might try for a job in city government,'' she said in her oral history. Her father suggested speaking to his secretary, who just happened to be Mayor La Guardia's sister. ''I'm not averse to using contacts,'' Ms. Clark said.         The result was an interview with the mayor at his temporary offices in the Empire State Building during a renovation of City Hall. In the middle of the session, an aide scurried in and whispered in the mayor's ear. The mayor jumped up. ''I have to go to a fire,'' he said. ''Come back on Monday.''         She was not sure she wanted the job, which involved reorganizing extensive files, supervising three secretaries and much more. But when it was offered, at a salary of $2,600 a year, she grabbed it. Eight months later she received a raise of $280 a year, according to a one-paragraph report in The New York Times.         She was meeting people like Robert Moses, the man behind the city and state's highways, bridges and parks. Introducing her, Mayor La Guardia said, ''She's a career woman.'' Mr. Moses looked at her and asked how long that would last.         She never married, perhaps because her social life was circumscribed by the mountains of work she habitually brought home. She was tall and slender, and had ''a sweet manner of speaking,'' said Edith Spivack, 89, a lawyer who worked in the La Guardia administration. Her voice was authoritative, and she squinted a bit when making an important point, said Richard K. Lieberman, director of the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.         Ms. Spivack said: ''She was neat and tidy. She was all the things a lady should be.''         As the war deepened, the Board of Estimate did less and less. So Ms. Clark went to Washington to work in the Pentagon, the State Department and the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.         After the war she used a recommendation from Mr. Moses to get a job working on transportation issues in Nassau County. She then worked for the United Nations, raising money for Unicef and helping refugees in Bremen, Germany.         For years Ms. Clark continued to fight for civic improvements, as a member of her Upper East Side community board and in other forums. She led the successful fight to expand bus service on First Avenue to better serve the hospitals there. She lobbied to build four tracks rather than the planned two on the Second Avenue subway should that ill-starred line ever be built.         She is survived by a sister, Margaret Vander Veer of Charlotte, N. C.       
         Sarah Caudwell, the British author whose modest but ecstatically received output of three erudite and maliciously witty mystery novels led at least one critic to compare her to Oscar Wilde, died on Jan. 28 at her home in London. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said Barney Karpfinger, her agent.         Ms. Caudwell produced her first novel, ''Thus Was Adonis Murdered,'' in 1981, during an accomplished career as a Chancery barrister. The novel was set in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where the author had practiced law. It featured a sleuth, Hilary Tamar, who taught law at Oxford, as did Ms. Caudwell.         Although the story revolved around the lusty antics of ''a decorative little group'' of junior barristers, it was the classical erudition and acerbic tongue of the narrator, whose sex is never stated, that set the droll tone of the series. ''I am an  historian'' was Tamar's explanation for the devious workings of his or her mind. ''My profession largely consists of speaking ill of the dead.''         ''The Shortest Way to Hades''  (1985) and ''The Sirens Sang of Murder'' (1989) continued in the same elegantly mannered style, with stories bound up in arcane areas of British law and steeped in obscure allusions to classical literature. (A crucial clue in ''The Shortest Way to Hades'' is embedded in Book XI of ''The Odyssey.'') Her final novel, ''The Sybil in Her Grave,'' which deals with insider stock trading and corporate takeovers, will be published in June by Delacorte Press.         The incisiveness of her legal points won her admirers among members of the profession, including Robert Bork (who was once quoted as saying, ''In my opinion, there can't be too many Sarah Caudwell novels''), while the gleeful savagery of her satiric style made her a darling of the critics. Newgate Callendar, in The New York Times Book Review, praised her for writing ''in a kind of English that has not been around since the days of Oscar Wilde.''         Sarah Caudwell was born May 27, 1939, to the author and journalist Claud Cockburn and his wife, Jean Ross, the actress and writer who was Christopher Isherwood's model for Sally Bowles in his Berlin stories and the musical ''Cabaret.'' Ms. Caudwell chose the surname Caudwell because it was a family name. She is survived by her half-brothers, the political writers Alexander, Andrew and Patrick Cockburn.         Her family ''recognized how much of Sarah there was in her characters,'' Andrew Cockburn said. ''There are certain aspects of Hilary Tamar, certain eccentricities, that are pure Sarah, although not Sarah's pipe-smoking. And, of course, that acuity of mind. Sarah had this incredibly sharp brain, which was evidenced by her success at both navigating and portraying what someone in Oliver Cromwell's Parliament once called 'the tortuous, ungodly jungle of English law.' ''         She graduated from Aberdeen University and received her law degree at St. Ann's College, Oxford. When she arrived there, the Oxford Union, a prestigious debating society, was still closed to women, said Andrew Cockburn. She led the fight that changed that, and she made her point at one off-limits event that she attended dressed as a man. Her disguise was discovered and she was ejected, but ultimately won the war.         She joined the Chancery bar in 1966 and worked in property and tax law. When she joined Lloyds Bank, she became a senior executive in the trust department.         ''As a woman, she had to have had a first-class mind to join the Chancery bar, to have built up a successful practice and to have become a senior executive at Lloyds,'' said a friend and fellow barrister, John Tackebury. ''All these institutions were highly resistant to women at a senior level, and certainly to a woman who smoked a pipe.''       
         Mae Faggs Starr, an Olympic champion sprinter and the first renowned athlete of the Tigerbelle women's track teams at Tennessee State University, died Jan. 27 at her home in Woodlawn, Ohio. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Eddie Starr.         In the 1950's, when women's track and field began its emergence, the Tigerbelles became a national force. Tennessee State's most heralded sprinter would be Wilma Rudolph, who at the 1960 Games in Rome became the first American woman to capture three gold medals in a single Olympics. Faggs, known as ''the mother of the Tigerbelles,'' was the first American woman to compete in three Olympics and was a mentor to Rudolph.         At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, she ran the first leg on the 4x100 relay that captured a gold medal in a world-record 45.9 seconds, teaming with Barbara Jones, who would go on to Tennessee State; Catherine Hardy; and Janet Moreau.         At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, Faggs ran on an all-Tennessee State 4x100 relay squad -- with Rudolph, Margaret Matthews and Isabelle Daniels -- that won a bronze medal.         Faggs won 11 national Amateur Athletic Union titles and was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in Indianapolis in 1976.         Aeriwentha Mae Faggs was born in Mays Landing, N.J., but grew up in New York City. She was a student at Bayside High School in Queens when, at age 16, she competed in the 1948 Olympics in London, failing to qualify for the 200-meter finals.         In the fall of 1952, she left for Tennessee State, a historically black school in Nashville. She had never been in the South and was warned by her father about the segregation she would face. But she thrived at Tennessee State, having been the first athlete recruited by Ed Temple, who would build a national reputation as the Tennessee State women's track coach and an Olympic coach.         ''She had a lot of determination, a lot of drive,'' Temple recalled Tuesday from his home in Nashville. ''She didn't back off from anybody, and she was a good student.''         Faggs was tested early on by her teammates.         ''I was already a national outdoor champion, I was national indoor champion, I had been to the Olympics,'' she recalled in an interview with Runner's World magazine in 1993. ''My teammates, all they cared about in practice was running past Mae Faggs. You couldn't let your guard down at all because if one ran past you . . . hey. They turned around and gave you one of those looks that said, 'Uh-huh, I got you now.' ''         With the Melbourne Games coming up, Faggs was trying for her third Olympic berth while Rudolph was a teenager hoping for her first. At the United States trials, Faggs set out to steady Rudolph's nerves with the finals of the 200 meters in sight even though they would compete against each other.         ''I knew Wilma was nervous because she was only 16, and I knew how nervous I was at 16 trying to make the Olympic team,'' Faggs remembered. ''So I told her: 'You do everything I do.' And she says, 'O.K.'         ''In the 200, Wilma was on the inside lane, I was in the second lane, and I couldn't see her coming out of the corner of my eye. So I turned my head and said, 'Come on.' And she said, 'I'm coming.' And she was coming. I mean, she was blowing down that straightaway. I had to reach back and get some of those horses I didn't think I had to beat her.''         After graduating from Tennessee State, Faggs received a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati and then taught physical education at high schools in the Cincinnati area.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Eddie Starr II, of Phoenix, and a daughter, Evelyn Starr, of Pittsburgh; two brothers, Melvin Faggs, of New York City, and Steve Murray, of Huntsville, Ala.; and two grandchildren.       
         Lenore Kight Wingard, an American swimmer who won medals in the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, died Wednesday at a hospital in Cincinnati, where she lived. She was 88.         Wingard won a silver medal in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles and a bronze at the 1936 Games in Berlin, both in the 400-meter freestyle.         Her silver-medal performance in 1932 came just a tenth of a second behind Helene Madison of the United States in a race so close that the judges took 15 minutes before declaring a victor. And both Wingard and Madison, who won with a time of 5 minutes 28.5 seconds, broke the previous world record.         As much as her medals, Wingard remembered the atmosphere of the 1936 Olympics, which was dominated by the presence of Hitler. Wingard, who swam in the days of wool suits and shirts, recalled that she once couldn't cross a street and go to her dormitory room for more than two hours because Hitler was coming down the route.         ''Where we stayed, we were fenced in, always guarded by soldiers,'' she told The Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview in 1991. ''When it was over, I was glad to get home.''         Wingard, a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was born in Frostburg, Md. She taught herself to swim when she was 14, growing up in the Pittsburgh area.         She then went on to local, state and national meets. In 1933, she won all the national freestyle swimming championship meets from 100 meters to 1,500 meters. By 1936 she held more swimming titles than any other woman.         Wingard won 20 national freestyle championships, and she held 21 American records and 7 world records in the freestyle.         After retiring from competitive swimming, she managed pools, taught swimming and, until about five years ago, swam about three miles a week at a local Y.M.C.A.         She is survived by her husband, Cleon J. Wingard; a son, Cleon Jr., of College Hill, Ohio; a daughter, Diane Lynn Peterson, of Denver; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral, chamber and vocal music, died on Monday at the Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was 86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years. Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980's her shorter works were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.         Ms. Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.         In the mid-1930's Ms. Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ''The Race of Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ''Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles Weidman and ''Tragic Exodus'' and ''They Too Are Exiles'' (both 1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ''Alcestis'' (1960) for Graham and ''My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.         Ms. Fine's symphonic works include ''Elegiac Song'' for muted strings (1937) and ''Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano, baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).         As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from 1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of her operas, ''The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings. Her last major work, ''The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and Ruth Crawford Seeger.         Still, Ms. Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by their sex. ''I hope the term 'woman composer' will be dropped soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989. ''I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk of 'poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists -- singers, pianists, violinists -- have been accepted for a long time.''         Ms. Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and Bennington College in Vermont.         She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of North Bennington, Vt.         Correction:  March 28, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the composer Vivian Fine on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her husband, Benjamin Karp of Hoosick Falls, N.Y.       
         Jeremy Ingalls, an acclaimed poet during the 1940's and 50's, died on March 16 in Tucson, where she lived. She was 88.         In 1941 Ms. Ingalls won the Yale Series of Younger Poets prize for ''The Metaphysical Sword,'' a collection that used classical, mythological, biblical and Oriental allusions. These influences weighed heavily in her most ambitious work, the epic ''Tahl'' (1945). The poem tells the story of a contemporary young musician who transcends time.         ''Tahl'' earned mixed reviews from critics who hailed it for its use of anthropological, historical, religious, literary and musical lore or criticized its writer for showing off her erudition.         In ''Tahl,'' she wrote:         The spice conjoint of human ironies         Palled on him more insipid than my game         Of cards, my maundering on fate. He stood         Groping Trophonian caves for Gygian rings         Visions and apologues, ladders to beautiful good,         And farmer's common saws could only prick him.         Mildred Dodge Jeremy Ingalls grew up in Gloucester, Mass. At 12 she was reading Dante and by 14 she took in Balzac, Goethe, Confucius, Sun Yat-sen and Nietzsche. She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees from Tufts College and studied Chinese at the University of Chicago Oriental Institute. In 1948 she joined the faculty at Rockford College in Illinois, where she taught Chinese history, English literature and creative writing before retiring  in 1960.         Ms. Ingalls's first published work, ''A Book of Legends'' (1941), was prose. It was followed in 1953 by ''The Galilean Way,'' a study of comparative religions. Her poetry collections included ''The Woman From the Island'' (1958), ''These Islands Also'' (1959) and ''This Stubborn Quantum'' (1983). In 1989 she published ''The Epic Tradition and Related Essays.''         She is survived by a foster son, Yong-ho Ch'oe of Honolulu.         In recent years several of Ms. Ingalls's poems were published in an anthology from the Yale University Press and she was honored by the University of Chicago as ''a poet of the ages.''       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Janet Reed, whose comic gifts and sparkling technique made her one of American dance's most beloved ballerinas in the early years of American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, died in Seattle last Monday. She was 83 and lived in Seattle.         She suffered a stroke one week earlier, said Maren Erskine, her daughter-in-law.         A petite redhead whose vivacious energy delighted audiences in both story ballets and pure-dance works, Ms. Reed was San Francisco Ballet's leading ballerina from 1937 to 1941 before joining Ballet Theater in 1942 and City Ballet in 1949.         She was a member of Eugene Loring's experimental chamber company, Dance Players, in 1942. In 1974 she helped found the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, remaining for two years as its first artistic director.         A member of the original cast of Jerome Robbins's first ballet, ''Fancy Free,'' Ms. Reed became associated with a memorable role and the kind of all-American image that audiences identified with her dancing. When Robbins created ''Fancy Free'' for Ballet Theater in 1944 he cast her as the young woman who dances a romantic duet with a sailor in a bar during World War II and then wipes her lipstick off his face.         By then Ms. Reed had also performed the ballerina roles in the 19th-century classics in San Francisco. These included Willam Christensen's 1940 staging of ''Swan Lake,'' the ballet's first full-length American production. As Lincoln Kirstein noted in his book ''Movement and Metaphor,'' Ms. Reed was an excellent comedian but also a classical dancer.         Kirstein and George Balanchine founded City Ballet in 1948 and Balanchine invited Ms. Reed into the company a few months later. He quickly cast her in his signature Neo-Classical ballets, including ''Symphony in C'' and ''Serenade.''         In 1949 he choreographed ''Bourree Fantasque,'' whose final exuberant section exploited the vitality and virtuosity that made up Ms. Reed's trademark style.         In the 1940's and 50's City Ballet was a very different company than it is today. Balanchine continued to develop a plotless Neo-Classical genre, but the repertory was eclectic, drawing upon a variety of choreographers. Robbins, like Ms. Reed, had transferred from Ballet Theater and become associate artistic director in 1949. Ms. Reed had danced in the 1945 premiere of ''Interplay,'' Robbins's enduring mix of bravura and blues, and he continued to use her.         Comic ballets, even by Balanchine, were not a rarity at City Ballet and in this realm Ms. Reed was queen. In Balanchine's ''A la Francaix,'' Ms. Reed was a belle who lost her swain, Andre Eglevsky, to a sylph, Maria Tallchief. In ''The Pied Piper,'' by Robbins, Ms. Reed led a jiving pack after a clarinetist onstage. She was the droopy Hortense, queen of the Waterlilies in Ruthanna Boris's ''Cakewalk,'' a comic gloss on minstrel shows.         In City Ballet's 1953 revival of Lew Christensen's ''Filling Station,'' a bit of 1938 Americana, Ms. Reed danced opposite the young Jacques d'Amboise as a gas station attendant. She was in her element as a tipsy debutante. When Balanchine created ''Western Symphony'' Ms. Reed made his satire of a classical adagio a lesson in strong technique and projection.         John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, devoted an article to Ms. Reed in 1954: ''Janet Reed is adorable, all right, and that unquestionably brings a great many customers to the box office; but she is also an artist of very high attainments, and a performer among performers.''         Ms. Reed was born in Tolo, Ore., and studied ballet with Willam Christensen in Portland, Ore., and San Francisco.         Although repeatedly praised for her comic timing and engaging characterization, Ms. Reed had an extensive dramatic range that she displayed in Antony Tudor's psychological ballets and Michael Kidd's ''On Stage!'' at Ballet Theater.         After marrying Branson Erskine, an interior designer, she appeared in the Robbins musical ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing'' in 1947. She is survived by a son, Reed Erskine of New York, and a daughter, Jane Erskine of Seattle.         Ms. Reed returned to Ballet Theater briefly before joining City Ballet, where she danced until 1958 and then was its ballet mistress until 1961. She taught in several colleges before moving to Seattle, where she also staged dances for the Seattle Opera. In 1983 she and Gene Kelly were the hosts of a gala celebrating the San Francisco Ballet's 50th anniversary.       
         Ingrid G. Brainard, a dance historian and teacher of historical dance, died on Feb. 18 at her home in West Newton, Mass. She was 74.         The cause was a heart attack, said Tristram Perry, a spokesman for the Boston Conservatory, where Dr. Brainard taught.         Dr. Brainard received a doctorate in musicology from the University of Gottingen in Germany, writing her dissertation on ''The Choreographer of the Court Dances of Burgundy, France and Italy in the 15th Century.'' Her area of expertise extended through dance of the 18th century.         In addition to reconstructing and staging the dances, Dr. Brainard lectured and wrote for publications including the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the Dance Research Journal, the Harvard Dictionary of Music and Die Musikforschung.         One of the first fellows of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Studies in Cambridge, Mass., Dr. Brainard was an artist in residence at Northeastern University and served as a director and chairwoman of the Congress on Research in Dance. She also founded the Cambridge Court Dancers. She had taught dance history at the Boston Conservatory since 1983.         Her marriage to Paul Brainard ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Christopher, of Newton.       
         Frances Gray Patton, a writer whose short stories appeared in The New Yorker through four decades and whose works included the popular 1954 novel ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. She was 94 and lived in Durham.         Ms. Potter's finely crafted stories offered glimpses into Durham society in the mid-20th century, a world she knew well as a Duke faculty wife.         Her first published work, ''A Piece of Bread,'' the story of a Southern girl's encounter with a prison chain gang, won a Kenyon Review prize and was included among the 1945 ''O. Henry Memorial Award Prize Stories.''         After that, The New Yorker began publishing Ms. Patton's stories, 30 in the next 10 years. Others appeared in magazines like Colliers, Harper's, The Saturday Review of Literature and McCall's. Her first book, ''The Finer Things of Life'' (1951), a collection culled mostly from works that appeared in The New Yorker, earned praise from critics.         Three years later, Ms. Patton's first novel, ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' was published. Developed from her story ''The Terrible Miss Dove,'' first published in Ladies' Home Journal, the work chronicled the life of a strict but beloved geography teacher in a small American town whose sudden illness shocks the community.         Writing in The New York Times, Charles Poore described the work as ''ruthlessly sentimental'' and ''a cheerful mixture of 'Goodbye Mr. Chips' and 'Mary Poppins,' with touches of the rigorous way to salvation from 'Life With Father.' ''         The novel was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and the movie rights were sold to 20th Century Fox, which turned the story into a popular film starring Jennifer Jones.         In 1955, Ms. Patton published ''A Piece of Luck,'' a second collection of stories, set mostly in suburbia, that explored the private worlds of children and women. A third collection, ''28 Stories,'' was published in 1969.         Frances MacRae Gray was born in Raleigh, N.C., where her father was editor of The Raleigh Times. Her mother had been the first woman to enroll at the University of North Carolina.         Ms. Patton became a writer by way of the theater. After high school, she attended Trinity College, now Duke University, before enrolling at the University of North Carolina, where she held a fellowship as a playwright and was active in the Carolina Playmakers. Over the years, she taught creative writing at both universities.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of San Francisco; two daughters, Mary Bogdonoff of Manhattan and Susannah Patton of Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Betsy Dworkin, a former senior lecturer in social policy and administration at the University of London's Chelsea and University colleges, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She would have been 67 today.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Ronald Dworkin.         Mrs. Dworkin was born in Manhattan to Walter and Adelaide Ross.         She received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1955 from Radcliffe College, where she studied American history and literature, and she was a Fulbright Scholar in Paris. She received a master's degree in the history of fine arts in 1957 from Harvard.         She went on to be a writer on the staff of the Metropolitan Museum, an associate editor of Art News and managing editor of a sister publication, the quarterly Portfolio. In 1962, she moved to New Haven, where she helped run a poverty program in the public school system.         In 1969, she moved to Britain, where in 1972 she received a second master's degree, this one in social policy, from the London School of Economics. From 1972 to 1989 she taught at Chelsea and University colleges.         In addition to her husband, Professor Ronald Dworkin, who teaches at New York University and at the University of London's University College, she is survived by a son, Anthony of London; and a daughter, Jennifer Dworkin of Manhattan.       
         Evelyn Swarthout Hayes, a former concert pianist, educator and arts patron, died on March 24 at George Washington University Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Hayes, who was born Evelyn Swarthout in Jacksonville, Ill., began her music career in the 1930's, appearing several times in recitals at Town Hall in New York. In 1939 she married Patrick Hayes, a music administrator. The couple moved to Washington when he was appointed manager of the National Symphony Orchestra.         Mrs. Hayes joined the piano faculty at American University in 1951 and taught there until retiring in 1976. She also continued to perform, giving recitals at the National Gallery and elsewhere, and she created ''Music in Schools,'' an educational radio program for young listeners.         She served as a judge in many piano competitions as well as giving lectures and master classes around the country.         Her husband, who founded the Hayes Concert Bureau -- later renamed the Washington Performing Arts Society -- died in 1998. She is survived by a son, Bryant, of New York; a daughter, Elisabeth Hayes of Chicago; a grandchild; two step-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren.       
         Verna Aardema Vugteveen, a late-blooming, prolific writer who regaled generations of American children with the folklore of faraway Africa, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 88.         Verna Aardema, the name on her books (of Dutch origin and pronounced AR-duh-ma), taught elementary school in Michigan from 1934 to 1973. She also contributed articles to The Muskegon Chronicle in Michigan and taught Sunday school as she developed into a full-time author and folklorist, retelling the lore of Mexico and, particularly, Africa for children ages 4 to 8.         She chose Africa when she realized that the continent, its people and their traditions remained terra incognita to American children. Her books became popular because they carried a natural storyteller's rhythm that lent itself to being read aloud by parents, and they were attractively illustrated and appealing to listeners of all ages.         Ms. Aardema had 33 books published, the first, ''Tales From the Story Hat,'' in 1960, and the latest, ''Koi and the Kola Nuts: A Tale From Liberia,'' last year. Her New York agent, Marilyn Marlowe, said that Ms. Aardema had several more  completed when she died.         Among her best-known books were ''Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears: A West African Tale'' (1975), and ''Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain'' (1981), which James Earl Jones read to inaugurate the PBS weekly program ''Reading Rainbow'' in 1982. Another favorite, ''Who's in Rabbit's House?'' (1977), retold a Masai tale in which a rabbit marshals his animal friends to remove a monster that has taken up residence in his home.         She was born Verna Norberg in New Era, Mich., and graduated from what is now Michigan State University in 1935. After she gave up teaching  to devote more time to writing, she maintained a presence in the schools as a guest story reader and lectured at colleges to help aspiring writers.         Locally, many knew her as the Story Lady. A stroke in 1992 left her in a wheelchair.         Her first husband, Albert Aardema, died in 1974. Her second husband, Joel Vugteveen, also died. She is survived by a son, Dr. Austin Aardema of Fort Myers; a daughter, Paula Dufford of Valrico, Fla.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Emily W. ReedEmily W. Reed, who in 1959 enraged Alabama segregationists by allowing a book about a fuzzy white rabbit marrying a fuzzy black rabbit onto the shelves of the state's central library, died on May 19 at a retirement community in Cockeysville, Md. She was 89.         The confrontation came as blacks were fighting to be allowed in public libraries throughout the South and a segregationist in Florida was demanding that ''The Three Little Pigs'' be removed from library shelves because the pigs were depicted in different colors. Such disputes, mirroring the struggle for access to schools and public libraries, were widely covered in the press.         In Ms. Reed's case, the book in question was ''The Rabbits' Wedding,'' written and illustrated by Garth Williams and published by Harper & Brothers in 1958. The book, which described a moonlit wedding attended by all the animals of the forest, was intended for children 3 to 7 years of age.         The book was attacked by The Montgomery Home News, a publication of the Montgomery, Ala., chapter of the White Citizens Council, on the ground that it promoted racial integration.         In response, Ms. Reed, who was the director of the Alabama Public Library Service Division, which lent books to local libraries throughout the state, ordered the book to be put on the agency's reserve shelves. This meant that local librarians visiting Montgomery could get the book by requesting it, but could not find it on the open shelves.         Harpers issued a statement from Mr. Williams saying the book had ''no political significance.''         ''I was completely unaware that animals with white fur, such as white polar bears and white dogs and white rabbits, were considered blood relations of white human beings,'' Mr. Williams said.         He added that his tale of rabbits ''was not written for adults, who will not understand it because it is only about a soft, furry love and has no hidden messages of hate.''         Ms. Reed said at the time that she liked the book and that her action was not tantamount to banning it. In an interview with The New York Times, she said that some local libraries in Alabama continued to put the book on their open shelves but that the state agency had some difficulty with it.         State Senator E. O. Eddins of Marengo County, who led the fight against Mr. Williams's book, said Ms. Reed had refused to answer when he asked her if she believed in racial integration. She said this had nothing to do with running the library service.         A measure was then introduced in the Alabama Legislature to require the state library chief to be a native of Alabama and a graduate of the University of Alabama or Auburn University. That would have disqualified Ms. Reed, who was born in Ashville, N.C. But in 1960 she left Alabama to become coordinator of adult services for the Washington, D.C., library system.         Emily Wheelock Reed grew up in Indiana and graduated from Indiana University. She worked in libraries in Detroit, Hawaii and Louisiana and taught library science at the University of Florida before becoming Alabama's library director in 1959.         After six years with the Washington library system, Ms. Reed moved to Baltimore, where she was coordinator of adult services at the Enoch Pratt Free Library until she retired in 1977.         She was cited for her work in Alabama by the American Library Association, and this year received the scroll of honor from the Freedom to Read Foundation.         She had no immediate survivors.       
         Ruth D. Turner, a Harvard professor, author, curator and diver who became one of the world's leading experts in the species of mollusks that devour wooden piers and sunken ships, died on April 30 at a nursing home in Waltham, Mass. She was 85.         Dr. Turner added volumes to the understanding of the creatures known as teredos, commonly called shipworms because of their resemblance to worms but actually a species of mollusk related to clams.         Sometimes called ''the mollusk with the million-dollar appetite,'' teredos were mentioned in Greek literature dating to 350 B.C. and were dreaded by early ocean explorers, including Columbus who lost all his vessels to the worms on his fourth voyage to the Americas. They have also been blamed for the deterioration of the Hudson River piers in New York City.         Dr. Turner even hypothesized that the pests caused the hole in the wooden dike that the Little Dutch Boy plugged with his finger. ''It may be the little Dutch boy put in more than his thumb,'' she said. ''He probably put his whole arm in there.''         Dr. Turner, who was affectionately called Lady Wormwood, wrote more than 100 publications, almost all on shipworms, covering everything from their means of reproduction to how they bore into wood and how they dispersed over wide distances. Her study of the worms took her around the world.         Working with Robert D. Ballard, who discovered the sunken liner Titanic in 1985, she identified mollusks as the reason so little wood remained in the wreck. She investigated dozens of other shipwrecks and appeared on National Geographic television specials to discuss deep-sea vent systems, the warm-water ecosystems caused by volcanic activity. She was named to the Women Divers Hall of Fame, sponsored by several organizations including the Women's Scuba Association and the Underwater Society of America.         In 1971, she was the first woman in the Alvin, the deep-sea submersible owned and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod. She was comfortable in the male-dominated society of ocean research, often enjoying poker with her male colleagues.         Her passion was mentoring researchers in the manner in which William J. Clench, her predecessor as mollusk curator at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, had inspired her. She was always ready to provide free room and board at her Cambridge home to a needy student.         ''Do what sets you on fire,'' Dr. Turner urged her students. ''If you do what you love, you'll succeed.''         Ruth Dixon Turner was born on Dec. 7, 1914, in Melrose, Mass. Her father was cabinet maker; her mother was a dressmaker. She had seven brothers and sisters. Two sisters, Winifred Garrity of Sudbury, Mass., and Lina MacNeil of Wayland, Mass., survive her.         She worked her way through Bridgewater State Teachers College, then took a job in a one-room schoolhouse in Vermont, the first of several teaching posts in New England. She worked for a short period at the New England Museum of Natural History, now the Boston Museum of Science.         In 1944, she earned a master's degree in ornithology from Cornell University. She then taught at Vassar and worked as a biologist at the Clapp Laboratory in Duxbury, Mass. Her next stop was Harvard, where she worked as a research assistant as she earned a doctorate in biology from Radcliffe in 1954.         She remained at Harvard as a research assistant and biology lecturer. When Dr. Clench invited her to lunch, she quickly became intrigued by mollusks. ''Things were not going well in the bird department,'' she later explained.         From 1963 to 1975, she was the Alexander Agassiz Fellow at the zoology museum. Since 1976, she has been a professor of biology. She also served as co-editor of the scientific journal Johnsonia.         A tiny woman with a strong jaw and equally strong opinions, she brought an easy grace to scientific expeditions, teaching others how to tie seaman's knots and sometimes cutting hair. She scuba dived until she was well into her 70's and went on her last expedition just two years ago. She never married.         The love of her life were the students she helped to understand science. She said this devotion came from a promise she had made to Dr. Clench.         ''When I asked Bill how I could return the kindness he'd given me, he said, 'You can't,' '' she said. '' 'Just do it for the next generation.' ''       
         Diane Divers Blair, who taught and practiced politics in Arkansas for 30 years, becoming fast friends with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, died on Monday at her home in Fayetteville, Ark. She was 61.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         At her death she was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Arkansas, where she lectured and wrote from 1968 until her retirement three years ago.         Mrs. Blair befriended the Clintons in the mid-1970's. She worked as a researcher for Mr. Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and as an adviser in his 1996 re-election effort. In 1993, Mr. Clinton appointed her to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.         The friendship drew scrutiny in Mr. Clinton's first term after it was revealed that Mrs. Blair's husband, James B. Blair, the chief counsel to Tyson Foods, had helped Mrs. Clinton make nearly $100,000 in profits from trading in commodity futures.         Professor Blair was a regular guest at the White House, and the Clintons reciprocated, visiting her in Fayetteville three times in recent months during her illness.         The Clintons are expected to attend a memorial service for her next month.         Professor Blair was born in Washington. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell University in 1959 and received an M.A. in political science at the University of Arkansas in 1967.         In between she worked as an analyst for the President's Committee on Government Contracts, a researcher for the Senate Special Committee on Unemployment and legislative secretary to Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.         After moving to Arkansas, she served Governors Dale L. Bumpers and David H. Pryor on various state commissions.         In 1980, Governor Clinton appointed her a commissioner of the Arkansas Educational Television Network, and she served until 1993. The board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting elected her chairman in 1997 for a two-year term.         In addition to writing many articles and book chapters, she was the author of ''Arkansas Government and Politics: Do the People Rule?'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1988).         In addition to her husband of 21 years, Professor Blair is survived by a son and a daughter by an earlier marriage, William R. Kincaid of Washington and Kathryn K. Jong of Fayetteville; two stepdaughters and a stepson, Heather E. Blair of Chicago, Arden S. Blair of Columbia, Md., and James R. Blair of Fort Worth; a sister, Lois Alard of Fayetteville, and two grandchildren.       
         Barbara T. Christian, a professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley and a pioneer of contemporary American literary feminism, died on June 25 at her home in Berkeley. She was 56.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia McBroom, a university spokeswoman.         The author and editor of several books and 100 articles and reviews, Ms. Christian was best known for her landmark study ''Black Women Novelists: The Development of a Tradition.'' It appeared in 1980 amid a general rediscovery of the work of such writers as Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and the rise to prominence of several younger authors, including Toni Morrison and Alice Walker.         Ms. Christian was a leading critical presence in the growing debates over the relationship among race, class and gender. Her widely cited article ''The Race for Theory'' challenged the increasing domination of African-American literary study by those who were primarily interested in theory rather than in writers and their work.         Born in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Ms. Christian entered Marquette University in Wisconsin at the age of 15. After she graduated cum laude in 1963, her family urged her to study medicine, but she instead chose graduate study at Columbia University, from which she received a doctorate in contemporary British and American literature in 1970. During her graduate studies, she also taught at the City College of the City University of New York.         In 1971, she was appointed assistant professor at Berkeley. A year later, she was instrumental in the establishment of the department of African-American studies, where she taught until her death. She was chairwoman of the department from 1978 until 1983. She led Berkeley's new doctoral program in ethnic studies from 1986 to 1989.         In 1978, she became the first African-American woman to be granted tenure at Berkeley. In 1986, she became the first to be promoted to full professor. In 1991, she won the university's Distinguished Teaching Award, the first African-American to do so. This year, she received the Berkeley Citation ''for distinguished achievement and for notable service to the university.''         In a letter supporting her nomination, Henry Louis Gates Jr. of Harvard University wrote that Ms. Christian ''has emerged as the senior figure among African-American feminists.'' Arnold Rampersad of Stanford University called her ''a major shaper and guide in the general area where the subjects of literature, race and feminism meet.''         Ms. Christian's marriage to David Henderson, a poet and a biographer of Jimi Hendrix, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Najuma Ide Christian of Berkeley; her parents, Judge Alphonso A. and Ruth Christian of St. Thomas; three sisters, Dr. Cora Christian of St. Croix, Reubina Gomez of St. Thomas and Alicia Wells of Philadelphia; two brothers, Alphonso Christian of Washington and Delano Christian of San Francisco; and a stepson, Imetai Malik Henderson of New York.       
         Ursule Molinaro, a novelist and translator, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was believed to have been in her 80's, said McPherson & Company, her publishers.         In a career that spanned five decades, she wrote 14 novels, 4 collections of short fiction and 18 one-act plays. She also translated books and was fluent in five languages.         Born in Paris, Ms. Molinaro was educated at the Sorbonne and the University of London, and studied medicine in Florence, Italy. Jailed for harboring Jews in Paris during World War II, she escaped and joined the Resistance. After the war she became a freelance journalist and soon published her first book, a collection of fables.         She came to New York in the 1950's to work as a simultaneous translator at the United Nations and adopted English as her primary language. Her first book published here was ''Mirrors for Small Beasts'' (Noonday Press) in 1960. That year she was also one of the founders of Chelsea magazine, a literary journal.         Ms. Molinaro's books include ''The Borrower,'' ''Green Lights Are Blue'' and ''Sounds of a Drunken Summer.''         During the 1960's and 70's Ms. Molinaro wrote a series of one-act plays and translated works by such authors as Hermann Hesse, Nathalie Sarraute and Christa Wolf for publication in English. She also taught at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of Hawaii and New York University.         Her most recent book, a trio of short satirical novels under the title ''Demons and Divas,'' was published earlier this year.         She is survived by a daughter.       
         Ethel Brown Fitzgerald, a former New York City teacher and school administrator, lawyer and musician, died July 19 at a hospital in upstate Amsterdam. She was 68 and lived in Fonda, N.Y., and Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Fitzgerald spent 16 often contentious years on the City Board of Education's semiautonomous Board of Examiners, from 1974 until the State Legislature restructured it out of existence in 1990. She served variously as a member, vice chairwoman and chairwoman.         The examiners tested prospective teachers and supervisors and drew up lists from which the school board appointed job candidates. Their critics charged the panel had become a cumbersome anachronism and a bottleneck.         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's view the chancellor and school board were trying to circumvent the merit system. Indeed, she asserted, they flirted with the very Tammany Hall-style patronage system that led to the creation of the independent examiners in the first place, in 1898.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Fitzgerald was a 1954 music graduate of Hunter College and taught orchestral and choral music in the public schools until 1967. As Ethel Brown, a member of the musicians' union, she played the cello with professional symphony orchestras.         By 1968 she had completed her graduate work at Brooklyn College, Columbia University and New York University. She received the certificate of an education supervisor and administrator from Hunter, and, in 1981, she received a doctor of laws degree from Brooklyn Law School.         She held a number of positions as assistant principal, principal and teachers' trainer before being appointed to the Board of Examiners, then practically a lifetime job. In recent years she had been in private law practice in Fonda.         Mrs. Fitzgerald is survived by a son, Dr. Kim Fitzgerald of Cleveland; her mother, Effie Hargett Brown of Fonda; and six grandchildren.       
         Sister M. Isolina Ferre, a Catholic nun from a wealthy family in Puerto Rico who was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Clinton last August for over half a century of charity and peacemaking, died on Thursday in her native city of Ponce. She was 85.         ''Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New York City to solve their differences without violence,'' President Clinton said in a statement last week. ''In Puerto Rico, her community service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed ravaged neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to empower themselves.''         Sister Isolina won the Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the government can give a civilian, for establishing charitable centers in New York City and Appalachia, in addition to Puerto Rico.         A friend and fellow nun in Sister Isolina's order, the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, said that Sister Isolina successfully mediated a conflict between warring Puerto Rican youth gangs in Brooklyn in the 1950's and 60's while she was the director of a Catholic charitable center there.         The friend said Sister Isolina's success as a peacemaker was the result of her interpersonal skills, her training in sociology at Fordham and the insights provided by her Puerto Rican heritage.         She also worked with Portuguese immigrants in New England and black youths in Brooklyn.         She won a Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1980 for her work in revitalizing communities and neighborhoods and organizing local groups to serve the unemployed, underskilled, delinquent, sick and handicapped.         Sister Isolina was born into a Puerto Rican family that owns two leading newspapers. Her brother, Luis, was a governor of Puerto Rico, and established the ruling New Progressive Party. She employed her family's influence in establishing charitable organizations.         In 1935, while on a trip to Havana, she decided to join the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity.  She studied at St. Joseph College for Women and at Fordham University. Her work in Puerto Rico included founding a vocational school in Ponce.         She is survived by her brother.       
         Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.         Mrs. Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960's. She helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated 10,000 black adults were registered.         At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of black adults were not registered. Thanks largely to Mrs. Devine, blacks began to show up at the county courthouse almost daily, demanding to register.         She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer. Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, of which Mrs. Devine was a founder.         After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run, but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom Democrats and calls for Congressional investigations into voting in Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the civil rights struggle.         In the 1960's she also helped found the Child Development Group of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community support.         Mrs. Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Gordon, the influential editor of House Beautiful magazine for more than 20 years, a missionary of taste to the American homemaker and an indefatigable supporter of Frank Lloyd Wright, died on Sept. 3 in Adamstown, Md., where she lived. She was 94.         When she took over as editor of House Beautiful in 1939, Ms. Gordon was determined to educate the American public about appropriate design and new American architecture. She devoted entire issues to topics like climate control and the emerging ranch house in California.         Her ''pace setter'' issues in the late 1940's tracked and explained important trends in design to an audience just learning how to consume. In a 1953 essay, ''The Threat to the Next America,'' she railed against cultural dictatorship and the evils of ''a self-chosen elite who are trying to tell us what we should like and how we should live,'' by which she meant the followers of International-style architecture, the curators at the Museum of Modern Art and European architects like Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.         The article attracted the appreciative attention of Frank Lloyd Wright, who became a mentor and close friend.         Another influential essay in 1960, ''We Invite You to Enter a New Dimension: Shibui,'' extolled the principles of understated resonance and serenity in design and is credited with introducing traditional Japanese design ideas to the American public.         ''She was an amazingly influential editor, crusading for the softer side of contemporary design,'' said Louis Oliver Gropp, the recently retired editor in chief of House Beautiful. ''When she covered a topic she did it in staggering depth.''         Ms. Gordon was born in Logansport, Ind., attended the University of Chicago and briefly taught high school in Wisconsin. In the 1930's she moved to New York to work as a promotional copywriter for several newspapers. She used that job as a springboard to a syndicated column on home maintenance for The New York Herald Tribune, then an editorship at Good Housekeeping, where she remained for eight years.         During the Depression, she wrote a popular how-to book, ''More House for Your Money'' (Morrow).         Ms. Gordon, who always used her maiden name professionally, married Carl Hafey Norcross, a writer and expert on aviation and planned communities, and became a pilot herself. Mr. Norcross died in 1988; Ms. Gordon is survived by a sister-in-law, Gertrude Norcross of San Diego.         At House Beautiful, Ms. Gordon, who was as famous for her large hats as for her imperious taste and insatiable curiosity, once called the magazine ''a propaganda and teaching tool.'' It took her five years of research and seven trips to Japan to prepare for the special issue on shibui. In 1988, she deposited all the materials in an archive at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. Some of her other collections were donated to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.         But it was her diatribe against the International style that proved a turning point in her career. It virtually equated the style with communism, or at least a foreign architectural invasion, and warned people not to be sure that ''it can't happen here.'' Soon after it was published, she received a mysterious telegram: ''Didn't think you had it in you. Am at your service from here on.'' It was signed only ''Godfather,'' but it came from Wright.         For the rest of the 1950's, the master architect and the determined editor worked closely together. When Wright designed one of his famous Usonian houses for a retrospective exhibition, the editors of House Beautiful furnished it. She called her office ''an extension of Taliesin,'' and allowed Wright to install an apprentice architect from Taliesin as the magazine's architecture editor.         Ms. Gordon devoted two special issues to Wright, keeping the aging architect in the public eye when the eyes of critics had turned elsewhere. He always referred to himself as her Godfather, and designed a bed with built-in cabinets and a jungle motif for her and her husband.         In 1964, Ms. Gordon left the magazine world, angry with the growing intimacy between editorial content and advertising demands.         In the 1970's, she and her husband retired to Maryland and a house filled with Japanese textiles and an Otto Natzler pottery collection. From there she continued to consult and lecture widely on design matters close to her heart.         In 1972, a special issue on Scandinavian design that she had published with an accompanying exhibition that traveled the country won her the insignia of a knight, first class, in the Finnish Order of the Lion. In 1987, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. As her goddaughter Brooke Shearer Talbot said, Ms. Gordon ''wore those big pieces of metal at every opportunity.''         ''She was not afraid to stand out.''       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneer in journalism, especially because she worked at a time when few women held positions of power in the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way to a circulation of 50,000 from 12,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction to and informal education in journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered with  charities. Society columnists called her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had been editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. The two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and kept up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, the Hollywood financier who is Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married Amos Mathews around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up its news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Sybil H. Milton, a leading scholar of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and a senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, died on Oct. 16 in the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. She was 59.         Dr. Milton, who lived in Chevy Chase, Md., died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, Henry Friedlander, a professor of history at the City University of New York and president of the German Studies Association.         She taught German history at Stanford University and elsewhere before becoming director of archives at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York from 1974 to 1984. Afterward, she was a consultant to the Holocaust Memorial Council.         At the time of her death, Dr. Milton was vice president of the Swiss-appointed Independent Commission of Experts, which was investigating Swiss policies toward Jews and Nazis during the Holocaust.         Last December, the commission issued a report condemning Switzerland's restrictive policies toward Jewish immigration during the war years when European Jews were seeking refuge from Nazi genocide.         Dr. Milton, who represented the United States on the commission, studied Swiss banks and the Nazi handling of Jewish-owned assets, precious metals and works of art.         Menachem Z. Rosensaft, a member of the executive committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which oversees the Washington museum, and who knew of Dr. Milton through her work there, said she was a pioneer in studying the memorials and archives of the Nazi death camps throughout Europe.         During a long hospitalization, Dr. Milton continued work on her latest book, ''The Camera as Weapon and Voyeur: Photography of the Holocaust as Memorial Evidence,'' which Dr. Friedlander said he plans to complete.         Sybil Halpern was born on Oct. 6, 1941, in New York City to Jewish parents who had fled Austria when the Nazis came to power.         After graduating from the High School of Music and Art, she received a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1962, a master's the next year and a doctorate from Stanford University in modern German history in 1971.         Dr. Milton's marriage to Daniel Milton ended in divorce. She is survived by Professor Friedlander.       
         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Sophie Koulomzin, a leading Orthodox Christian educator whose life encompassed the history of 20th-century Russia and the experience of Russian emigres, died in Valley Cottage, N.Y., on Friday. She was 96.         A longtime seminary instructor in the United States, she wrote widely used textbooks and church histories for use by emigres and lived to see them published in Russia, where she visited and lectured in the last few years of her life.         She was born Sophie Schidlovsky  in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1903, the daughter of Sergei Schidlovsky, the last vice president of the Czar's Duma, or Parliament.         A life of privilege was replaced by one of poverty as the family endured the first years of Soviet rule, then fled, first to Estonia, where her father died, then Berlin, then Paris.         In Germany, she studied philosophy at the University of Berlin and took part in philosophical discussions led by Nikolai Berdyaev, the Rev. Sergius Bulgakov and Semyon Frank, leading Russian religious thinkers and former Marxists who became liberal Christians and were expelled from the Soviet Union by Lenin in 1922. They were formative in her development as a broad-minded Orthodox Christian activist.         In 1926, a scholarship from the John D. Rockefeller Fund took her to the United States, where she graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in religious education.         Returning to Paris, she became a leader of the Russian Christian Student Movement, taught emigre children and edited two volumes of church school lessons. The student organization was financed by the Young Men's Christian Association, which at the time actively supported the efforts of Russian emigres to establish their church in exile.         Mrs. Koulomzin also did social work among poor Russian emigres, working with Elizabeth Skobtsova, who became an Orthodox nun known as Mother Maria and died in the Ravensbruck concentration camp after trying to help save Jews during the German occupation.         Mrs. Koulomzin was married in 1932 to Nikita Koulomzin, an engineer who was also of aristocratic descent, who survives her. She is also survived by their daughters, Elizabeth Lopukhin, Olga Poloukhine and Xenia Kalinin; their son, George; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Surviving the occupation, the family lived in Paris and then in the French provinces, where they helped Soviet prisoners of war taken by the Germans.         In 1948, the Koulomzins moved to Nyack, N.Y. Mrs. Koulomzin worked as a religious educator, creating an English-language education program and lecturing across the country. She founded the Orthodox Christian Education Commission to coordinate the work of the various Orthodox Christian ethnic groups in America.         Beginning in 1954, she taught for nearly 20 years at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, N.Y.,         After her official retirement in 1974, she continued working. At the time of her death she was president of Religious Books for Russia, founded to send Bibles and religious literature to Russia; it has continued its work in Russia.         Mrs. Koulomzin's books, including ''God Is With Us,'' ''History of the Orthodox Church'' and 'Our Church and Our Children,'' have become classic texts in Orthodox religious education. In recent years her books were widely published in Russia. Her memoir, ''Many Worlds: A Russian Life,'' written when she was 77, ends with an account of her first visit back to her homeland, in 1970.         ''Now I had again come briefly in touch with life there and suddenly I realized that there was no absolute break, no complete separation,'' she wrote. ''My life, my own life, such as it was, came easily in touch with the flow of life that went on in Russia. I was together with Russia in the life of the Church, I was together with Russia in the search for spiritual values that is going on there.''       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Anna Berenson Mayer, a social work policy planner and retired professor of social policy at Rutgers University, died on Wednesday at a New Brunswick, N.J., hospital. She was 91 and lived in East Brunswick, N.J.         Dr. Mayer, who received a doctorate in social work from Columbia University, was chosen in 1983 to head a newly formed Governor's Committee on Children's Services Planning for New Jersey. It was to make recommendations on children's issues to Gov. Thomas H. Kean.         ''We have to make sure that every child in the state has a maximum opportunity for healthy development,'' she said in an interview later that year. One obstacle she saw was inadequate welfare benefits for the poor, which, she said, made it '' very difficult to provide adequate counseling to families and their children'' who lacked ''the basic needs of food, shelter, good health care.''         She made similar observations when she delivered the panel's report to the State Legislature with the governor beside her.         She was also known as one of two co-authors of a monograph, ''Day Care as a Social Instrument,'' written for the Ford Foundation in the early 1960's. The founders of Head Start used it to help shape their program, which began in 1965.         She was born in New Orleans and taught at Columbia and New York Universities and then for a decade at the Rutgers Graduate School of Social Work.         Surviving are her husband, Nathan; a son, Steven, of Albany, Calif.; two grandchildren; and two sisters, Ruth Forsyth of New Orleans and Florence Marx of Bogalusa, La.       
         Ruth Belcher Dyk, one of the last surviving participants in the women's suffrage movement, died in her apartment in Rochester on Nov. 18. She was 99.         In a life that included working with delinquent girls, writing three books on psychology and producing anthropological studies of Navajo Indians with her husband, she never lost her fierce commitment to equality.         Only the protests of family members prevented her from going door to door in her wheelchair to canvass for Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial campaign in New York this fall. ''If I have learned one thing, New York needs a woman's touch,'' she said at rally for Mrs. Clinton on Aug. 22.         ''My mother was a suffragette,'' she said in the opening line of the Ken Burns documentary on the suffragists, ''Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' which was shown last year on the Public Broadcasting System. Her choice of word was surprising, said her daughter, Penelope Carter, of Rochester.         ''The word suffragette reminded her of the Rockettes,'' Ms. Carter said. ''She was a suffragist.''         Mrs. Dyk's deepest inspiration was her mother, Annie Manson Belcher. She was one of the first women admitted to Tufts Medical School in the late 19th century, but school officials made her drop out when she married, Ms. Carter said. The free spirit of Mrs. Belcher, who by then was married to Arthur Fuller Belcher, a lawyer, is suggested by a family story of borrowing a minister's house for a Maine vacation. When a a house of ill repute next door burned down, Mrs. Belcher graciously invited the prostitutes to stay in the minister's house, engendering a local scandal.         Mrs. Dyk and her mother walked side by side down Beacon Avenue in Boston to demand the vote. Both were overjoyed when the 19th Amendment became part of the Constitution on Aug. 26, 1920.         ''We had worked so long,'' Mrs. Dyk said in the documentary. ''If you had worked years to do it, if you believed in it, if you thought great things were going to come out of it -- great in terms of the position of women in our culture, position of women in jobs, position of women everywhere -- and this was going to improve that . . . I mean lives would be changed.''         Later in the documentary, she said she feared that women's lives ''haven't changed as much as we hoped for.'' She told friends and family members that if women had voted as a bloc, they could have effected more change. ''I don't know if we did enough with it,'' she said.         Mrs. Clinton, however, lauded her contributions in a statement after her death. ''Her devotion to her family, her profession and her work in both the local and global community is an example for women everywhere,'' the first lady said.         Mrs. Dyk was born in Portland, Me., on March 25, 1901. She was proud to say that her pedigree included several families from the Mayflower, including Myles Standish. She grew up in Newton Center, Mass., and, like her mother, attended Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass. She earned a master's degree in economics from Simmons College in Boston, and did further graduate work at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley.         She worked as a psychiatric social worker with delinquent girls in upstate New York, where, among other things, she taught her clients to play pool. She worked as a researcher at what was then called the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York in Brooklyn, and was co-author of three books: ''Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth'' (Hoeber, 1950); ''Psychological Differentiation'' (Wiley, 1962); and ''Left Handed'' (Columbia University Press, 1980).         She completed the last volume with her husband, Walter Dyk, an anthropologist who studied Navajo Indians. His principal work, called ''a revelation of the real life of the tribe'' by The New Yorker, was in the form of an autobiography of one man, ''Son of Old Man Hat,'' (Harcourt Brace, 1938).         After his death in 1972, Mrs. Dyk took transcripts of taped conversations and other research and wrote ''Left Handed,'' a continuation of the first book.         Ms. Carter said her mother's strong will was evident when Mr. Dyk was suffering from Parkinson's disease and cancer and she was juggling two jobs and raising two children in the 1950's and 1960's. ''What choice did I have? I did what I had to do,'' she said.         But when she had choices, she took an unconventional approach. ''One of my earliest memories was her looking me in the eye and saying with just a bit of venom, 'Don't be so good,' '' Ms. Carter said. ''She meant you've to have some spirit, go against the grain.''         Mrs. Dyk emphasized to her daughter that it was not necessary to marry, and that it was important to get the education that would allow her to live independently. When Ms. Carter began smoking, Mrs. Dyk said it was fine with her. With nothing to rebel against, the girl quit the next day.         In addition to Ms. Carter, Mrs. Dyk is survived by her son, Timothy, of Washington, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Dyk smoked into her 80's, drove into her 90's and voted in the recent election. She recalled how she felt when she was among the first women to vote.         ''I was terribly frightened that I would push the wrong lever,'' she said. ''I still go into that booth with the same feeling -- what if I voted Republican?''       
         Eleanor Naumburg Sanger, the first program director of WQXR, the classical music station that was later purchased by The New York Times Company, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.         Mrs. Sanger and her husband, Elliott M. Sanger, who helped found the station, assembled the music and interviews that turned WQXR, one of the country's first FM classical stations, into a New York institution. She came upon the job almost by accident: Called down to the station one day not long after it was founded in 1936 to help out with a deluge of mail, she stayed for 23 years.         During more than 20 years as program director, Mrs. Sanger oversaw the staff that selected the symphonies and operas for each day's broadcast, published a program guide, hired announcers, and arranged for live radio performances by many great musicians, including Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn.         Mrs. Sanger was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Sept. 20, 1900. She taught at the Ethical Culture Society School. Except for a brief period in Paris, she spent her entire life in Manhattan.         She and her husband stayed on at WQXR long after the Times Company purchased it in 1944. Mrs. Sanger helped transform the station into an outlet for reporting breaking news to The Times's readers in New York between the paper's daily editions.         Mrs. Sanger is survived by a son, Kenneth E. Sanger, of White Plains,  three grandchildren, and four great-grandsons.       
         Gisela Kahn Gresser, a pioneer in women's chess and a nine-time national champion, died Dec. 4 in her Manhattan home. She was 94.         Mrs. Gresser, who was born in 1906 in Detroit, taught herself to play chess using a book a fellow passenger gave her on a cruise in 1939.         She was at the forefront of women's chess in the United States for more than three decades. She and a handful of other women, including Sonja Graf Stevenson, Mary Bain and Mona May Karff, dominated tournament competition from the 1940's to the 1970's.         Mrs. Gresser entered her first chess competition in 1940. In 1944, she won her first United States Women's Chess Championship.         She went on to win the championship eight more times, and became the first woman in the United States to earn a master's rating. In 1950, she was also awarded an international woman master title.         Throughout her career, Mrs. Gresser represented the United States in several international events. She played in five Women's Candidates tournaments and three Women's Chess Olympiads. She was also Women's World Chess Championship challenger in 1949 and 1950.         She retired from professional chess at 82. In 1992 she became the first woman inducted into the United States Chess Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Gresser studied classics as an undergraduate at Radcliffe College and won a fellowship for classical studies at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1927 she married William Gresser, a New York City lawyer and musicologist. He died in 1992.         She is survived by two sons, Ion and Julian, and a brother, Julius Kahn Jr.       
         Ilona Karmel Zucker, a Holocaust survivor who based much of her writing on her experiences in Nazi labor camps, died on Nov. 30 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 75.         Born in Krakow, Poland, Ms. Karmel endured the war years in the city's ghetto and in three nearby camps, where she composed her first literary work, ''Songs From Behind the Barbed Wire,'' a collection of poems written secretly on the backs of worksheets.         At Buchenwald, the last of the camps, both of her legs were crushed by a tank. During two years of postwar convalescence in a Swedish hospital, she learned to walk again and taught herself English by correspondence with Oxford University. She then immigrated to the United States in 1948, attending Hunter College before graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, where she was a protegee of the poet Archibald MacLeish.         She began her career as a short-story writer, winning the Mademoiselle College Fiction Prize in 1951 for ''Fru Holm.'' Her first novel, ''Stephania,'' completed while she was at Radcliffe and published in 1953, drew on her experiences in Sweden.         Her 1969 novel, ''An Estate of Memory,'' based on life in a Polish camp and centering on four prisoners who conspire to save the life of a child, is considered by scholars to be among the most resonant accounts of the Holocaust.         A review in The New York Times called it ''a very good book,'' adding that ''like Solzhenitsyn, Ilona Karmel has succeeded in writing about life in the prison camps'' as ''plausible, possible human experience.''         The work, translated into German in 1997, was recently reissued in paperback.         While pursuing her writing, Ms. Karmel taught in day care schools in a career that spanned a 10-year stay in Germany, where she worked in an orphanage.         On returning to the United States in 1978 with her husband, the physicist and philosopher Francis Zucker, she was appointed to a senior lectureship in the writing program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she remained until her retirement in 1995.         In 1995 M.I.T. named the Ilona Karmel Writing Prizes in her honor.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Florynce Kennedy, a lawyer and political activist whose flamboyant attire and sometimes outrageous comments drew attention to her fierce struggle for civil rights and feminism, died on Thursday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Known to everyone as Flo, recognizable everywhere in cowboy hat and pink sunglasses, she was one of the first black women to graduate from Columbia Law School, where she was admitted after threatening a discrimination suit. She fought in the courts and on the streets for abortion rights, represented Black Panthers, was a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and led a mass urination by women protesting a lack of women's restrooms at Harvard.         ''If you found a cause for the downtrodden of somebody being abused someplace, by God, Flo Kennedy would be there,'' former Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said yesterday.         People magazine in 1974 called her ''the biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground where feminist activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause.''         Justice Emily Jane Goodman of New York State Supreme Court said Ms. Kennedy gave women courage. ''She showed a whole generation of us the right way to live our lives,'' Justice Goodman said.         Friends like Gloria Steinem reveled in her razor-sharp wit. Ms. Steinem, who lectured with Ms. Kennedy in the 1970's, said a man in the audience would all too often stand up and demand, ''Are you lesbians?''         Ms. Kennedy would respond that it depended. ''Are you my alternative?'' she would ask.         Ms. Steinem said by phone from Hawaii yesterday, ''She understood what Emma Goldman understood: there has to be laughter and fun at the revolution, or it isn't a revolution.''         Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, yesterday called Ms. Kennedy ''one of the most wonderfully outrageous pioneers of feminism in America.''         Florynce Rae Kennedy, the second of five daughters, was born on Feb. 11, 1916, in Kansas City, Mo. Her father was a Pullman porter and later owned a taxi business. He once stood up with a shotgun to members of the Ku Klux Klan who wanted to drive him from a home he had bought in a mainly white neighborhood.         In her autobiography, ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'' (1976), she said her parents almost never criticized their daughters. In fact, they could seemingly do almost no wrong. ''We were taught very early in the game that we didn't have to respect the teachers, and if they threatened to hit us, we could act as if they weren't anybody we had to pay any attention to,'' she wrote.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Kennedy opened a hat shop in Kansas City with her sisters. Within a few years, she was involved in her first political protest, helping organize a boycott when the local Coca-Cola bottler refused to hire black truck drivers.         After the death of her mother, Zella, from cancer, Ms. Kennedy and her sister Grayce moved to New York. Ignoring those who urged her to become a teacher, she enrolled in pre-law courses at Columbia University. ''I find that the higher you aim, the better you shoot,'' she wrote.         She applied to Columbia Law School, but was refused admission. She was told the reason was not that she was black, but that she was a woman. Justice Goodman said she answered, ''To my friends at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, it all sounds the same.''         After threatening a lawsuit, Ms. Kennedy was admitted. She was one of eight women and the only black in her class. She graduated in 1951 and worked briefly for a Manhattan law firm before opening her own law office in 1954. Business was not good, and she had to take a job at Bloomingdale's one Christmas to pay the rent.         One of her cases involved representing the estates of the jazz greats Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker to recover money owed them by record companies. Even though she won the cases, the experience soured her on the law.         ''Handling the Holiday and Parker estates taught me more than I was really ready for about government and business delinquency and the hostility and helplessness of the courts,'' she wrote. ''Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practicing law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.''         She turned to political activism, setting up an organization called the Media Workshop in 1966 to fight racism in journalism and advertising. Picketing an advertising agency led to the protesters' being invited upstairs to state their case. She said, ''Ever since I've been able to say, 'When you want to get to the suites, start in the streets.' ''         Her strategy became to go after the biggest targets possible. ''Grass-roots organizing is like climbing into bed with a malaria patient in order to show how much you love him or her, then catching malaria yourself,'' she wrote. ''I say if you want to kill poverty, go to Wall Street and kick -- or disrupt.''         Increasingly, her legal cases were almost always political. ''Sweetie,'' she said, ''if you're not living on the edge, then you're taking up space.''         In 1966, she represented H. Rap Brown, the civil rights leader. In 1968, she sued the Roman Catholic Church for what she viewed as interference with abortion. In 1969, she organized a group of feminist lawyers to challenge the constitutionality of New York State's abortion law, an action credited with helping influence the Legislature to liberalize abortion the next year.         In 1969, she helped represent 21 Black Panthers on trial in Manhattan for conspiracy to commit bombings, among other things. They were eventually acquitted, but during the trial she used them for another purpose.         She and Ms. Goodman, not then a judge, and others were renting a house on Fire Island. They decided to take the Panthers to a community on the island for a dinner at a restaurant that did not accept blacks or Jews. It created quite a commotion, the intended effect. But afterward, Ms. Goodman asked if it was all that important, compared with the life and death issues at stake in the trial.         Ms. Kennedy gave an emphatic yes. ''Her point was that you have to fight on all the fronts all the time,'' Justice Goodman said.         Other fronts included founding the Feminist Party in 1971. Its first act was to nominate Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of New York, for president.         In 1967, Ms. Kennedy attended a rally against the Vietnam War in Montreal. Bobby Seale, the Black Panther, was not allowed to speak. ''I went berserk,'' she wrote. ''I took the platform and started yelling and hollering.'' An invitation for Ms. Kennedy to speak in Washington followed, and a 20-year lecturing career was born. She made $3,500 a lecture at her peak.         Ms. Steinem called her lectures with Ms. Kennedy on the college circuit ''the Thelma and Louise of the 70's.'' Ms. Steinem said, ''I definitely speak first because after Flo I would have been an anticlimax.''         In 1957, Ms. Kennedy married Charles Dye, a writer 10 years her junior. He died a few years later. ''Anyone who marries a drunk Welshman doesn't deserve sympathy,'' she once said.         Her views on the exclusivity of marriage were not much brighter. ''Why would you lock yourself in the bathroom just because you have to go three times a day,'' she wrote.         Ms. Kennedy is survived by three sisters, Joy Kennedy Banks of East Orange, N.J., Faye Kennedy Daly of Honolulu and Grayce Kennedy Bayles of Queens.         As her health failed, her spirit did not. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stopped to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.''
