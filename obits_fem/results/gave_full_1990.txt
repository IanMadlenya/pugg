Izard, a retired children's librarian in Westchester County, died of complications from cancer on Monday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa. She was 74 years old.         Miss Izard was a consultant for the Westchester Library System, which has more than 40 branches, for nearly 20 years. She led classes, workshops and monthly meetings for librarians in book reviewing, storytelling and book collections.         She headed the children's services division of the American Library Association and was former chairwoman of its Newbery-Caldecott committee.         She began her career at the New York Public Library and also worked in Greenwich, Conn., and Mount Vernon, N.Y., before going to Westchester in 1959. Miss Izard retired in 1976. The Board of Regents gave her the James E. Allen Jr. Memorial Award for distinguished service to education.         She graduated from Duke University in 1937 and received an M.A. from Simmons College in 1940.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jones instructed young women in charm, beauty and fitness as the owner-operator of the Candy Jones Career Girls School for more than 20 years. Later she and her husband, Long John Nebel, were co-hosts in Manhattan on a late-night talk and interview show, first on Radio Station WOR and then on WMCA. When Mr. Nebel died in 1978, she continued the all-night show until last year.         Candy Jones was born Jessica Arline Wilcox in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and educated in Atlantic City, where she won a beauty pageant at the age of 16. A trip to Manhattan followed, as did a modeling career and small roles in such 1940's Broadway musicals as ''Mexican Hayride'' and ''Polonaise.'' In World War II she headed a U.S.O. troupe called Cover Girls Abroad that entertained troops in the South Pacific.         Author of a Dozen Books         Tall, blond and with blue eyes, she gave beauty advice to women in more than a dozen books, including ''Make Your Name in Modeling and Television,'' ''Finishing Touches,'' ''Look Your Best,'' ''Between Us Girls'' and ''Candy Jones' Complete Book of Beauty and Fashion.'' Graduates of her school included Julia Meade and Sandra Dee.         In radio and television, Miss Jones was the hostess of several daytime talk and interview programs and took part in commercials as a performer, teacher and consultant. She also judged and advised beauty pageants and fashion shows around the country and lectured at colleges.         Before her marriage to Mr. Nebel, Miss Jones was married to Harry S. Conover, a model agency chief. The marriage ended in divorce.         Surviving are two sons, Harry Conover of Sudbury, Mass., and Carey Conover of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
        Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago.         The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).         Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).         Some of Her Other Films         Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953).         The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000.         From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards.         The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907.         When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again.         Left School at Age 13         Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family.         At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' ''         In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.         Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra.         'Beloved by All' Involved         Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.''         Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston.         Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times.         Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice:         ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.''         Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom.         Praise for 'Thorn Birds'         In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.''         Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce:         ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.''         In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer.

And, in 1987, her colleagues and admirers added their tributes to her independent spirit and professionalism as she received the 15th annual life achievement award of the American Film Institute.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).

        Jean Wallace, a screen actress who had feature parts in a dozen Hollywood productions and was married to two stars, Franchot Tone and Cornel Wilde, died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage Wednesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 66 years old.         Jean Wallace, a screen actress who had feature parts in a dozen Hollywood productions and was married to two stars, Franchot Tone and Cornel Wilde, died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage Wednesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 66 years old.         Among Miss Wallace's films, most of which were made in the 1940's and 1950's, were ''You Can't Ration Love,'' ''Song of India,'' ''Maracaibo'' and ''Lancelot and Guinevere.''         Miss Wallace, born Jean Walasek in Chicago, was a fashion model in her teens and went to Hollywood to get into pictures.         Rescued by Paramount         Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer gave her a part in a Hedy Lamarr feature, ''Ziegfeld Girl,'' but dropped her upon learning that she was not 19 years old, as she had said she was, but 17, which meant that under state law she could work only four hours a day and had to have a tutor.         Paramount gave her a six-month contract, complete with tutor. She was given a bit part in the 1941 musical ''Louisiana Purchase.'' By then she had become a protegee of Franchot Tone, who at 36 was twice her age, and in October 1941 she and the actor eloped to Yuma, Ariz., and were married.         The marriage lasted seven years, during which the couple had two sons, whose custody was awarded to Mr. Tone when they were divorced.         In 1949, after a visit with the chldren, Miss Wallace stabbed herself in the abdomen with a kitchen knife, but quickly recovered.         Early in 1950 she was married to James Randall, a soldier she had met while on a hospital tour. The marriage was annulled after five months. She married Cornel Wilde in 1951 and appeared in several movies made by Theodora Productions, a company she and Mr. Wilde created. They were divorced in 1981.         Miss Wallace is survived by three sons, Pascal Tone of Hamilton, Mass.; Thomas Tone of Ottawa, and Cornel Wallace Wilde of Beverly Hills, a brother, John Wallace of Los Angeles, a sister, Karol Crawford of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
        Dorothy Avery Slesinger, a teacher and co-founder of one of the first coeducational summer camps on the East Coast, died of pneumonia on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dorothy Avery Slesinger, a teacher and co-founder of one of the first coeducational summer camps on the East Coast, died of pneumonia on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.         With her husband, the late Donald Slesinger, a psychologist, Mrs. Slesinger founded Camp Tree Tops in Lake Placid, N.Y., in the early 1920's. The Slesingers gave up management of the camp in the early 1930's, and the camp was later sold.         Mrs. Slesinger, a graduate of Wellesley College, also taught at the Cherry Lawn School in Darien, Conn., in the 1920's. More recently, she was artist-in-residence at the James Lenox House in Manhattan.         She is survived by a son, Jonathan A., of Mountain View, Calif.; a daughter, Joanna Caproni of Manhattan; a sister, M. Helen Burnard of Nashua, N.H.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Nanette Guilford, a soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera from 1923 to 1932, died of an intestinal infection on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nanette Guilford, a soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera from 1923 to 1932, died of an intestinal infection on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Guilford, who was named Nanette Gutman at her birth on Aug. 17, 1903, in New York City, was one of the first American singers to establish an operatic career without going to Europe for training or for early performance opportunities. She studied privately with Albert Jeannotte and began her career in the musical theater, in ''The Midnight Rounders of 1921'' at the Century Promenade.         In May 1923, when she signed her first contract with the Metropolitan Opera, she gave her age as 18 and was said to be the youngest singer ever signed by the company. During her career, she was called ''the baby star'' of the company.         Miss Guilford made her debut in a minor role in a production of ''Rigoletto'' and sang small roles until March 20, 1926, when she appeared as Ginevra in ''La Cena Delle Beffe'' by Giordano. Her other Met roles included Aida, Liu in ''Turandot'' and Musetta in ''La Boheme. She appeared in early Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, and in the late 1920's she made several Vitaphone sound films. She also made recordings with the violinist Max Rosen, whom she married in 1928 and divorced in 1930.         She taught voice privately until 1981, and in recent years she gave master classes at C. W. Post College and Long Island University.         There are no survivors.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''

Miriam Witkin, a soprano who sang on several New York stations in the early days of radio and who gave concerts at Aeolian and Chickering Halls, died in her sleep on Sunday at a family home in Bridgewater, Conn., after a brief illness. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Witkin was born in Helena, Ark., and moved to New York City in 1914. In the early 1930's, she used the name Mary Windsor in broadcasting a children's music series on station WOR.         She is survived by her sons, Richard and William; a sister, Elinor; five grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
        Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Miss Goddard, a Hollywood star of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, was also publicized for her friendships with many notable figures; her marriages to Charles Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque, and her glamorous life style.         The actress, a former fashion model and showgirl, made her first major screen appearance in 1936 as a waterfront waif befriended by a forsaken assembly-line worker (played by Chaplin) in ''Modern Times,'' the last silent comedy feature.         Hollywood quickly took notice, and Miss Goddard earned leading comedy roles as an adventuress in ''The Young in Heart,'' as a battling wife seeking a Reno divorce in ''The Women,'' and as Bob Hope's pert romantic foil in ''The Cat and the Canary'' and ''The Ghost Breakers.''         Other early roles included a put-upon laundress in Mr. Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' (1940); Fred Astaire's partner in ''Second Chorus'' (1941), in which she gamely struggled to keep up with him in the dance ''I Ain't Hep to That Step, But I'll Dig It,'' and a lusty Southern belle singing a suggestive sea chanty to a party of prudes in the 1942 adventure ''Reap the Wild Wind.''         Runner-Up for Scarlett         The last of these roles was a consolation prize for the major disappointment of her acting career: losing the coveted part of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh in the final round of the ''Gone With the Wind'' competition. At the time Miss Goddard said she ''cried her eyes out,'' but years later she said she recalled the episode as only ''like a game.''         Miss Goddard, an energetic and articulate woman, was a close friend of a wide range of artists, including the composer George Gershwin, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and the artist Andy Warhol. She was wealthy, both from her Hollywood salaries and her husbands, but in later years she sold many costly artworks at auction, including her collection of Impressionist art, which was sold in 1979 for $2.9 million.         At the time, she said her reason for selling was no secret. ''It's because I don't want the responsibility any longer for this movable feast,'' she said, explaining that she was tired of carting the art from Switzerland to California and New York when she changed residences. Coincidentally, more than 20 items in her extensive jewelry collection are being sold today as part of an auction at Sotheby's in New York.         Tributes for Giving and Acting         The actress was known for her philanthropies as well as her art and gems. In the last 12 years, she awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to 300 theater and film students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She had previously given the university the diaries, manuscripts and personal library of Remarque, who died in 1970. In a statement yesterday, John Brademas, the university's president, hailed the ''vision and continued generosity'' of ''this remarkable actress.''         Miss Goddard's acting also inspired tributes. The writer Robert Benchley praised her as ''a woman who could charm a rock,'' and Ray Milland, a frequent co-star, hailed her as ''the most honest actress I ever knew; she gave it all she had.''         A celebrated Goddard role was a witty social-climber in ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' directed in 1946 by Jean Renoir. She said she preferred such roles to ''sweet, boring'' parts and that moviegoers also favored ''adventuruous characters because 90 percent of the public is good.'' When an interviewer called her glamorous, she defined glamour as ''a spell of charm,'' adding: ''I don't want to be a phony. I want to be real.''         The actress could also be blunt. When several of her friends were accused of being Communists by members of Congress in 1947, she remarked, ''If anyone accuses me of being a Communist, I'll hit them with my diamond bracelets.''         Powers Model and Ziegfeld Girl         Paulette Goddard was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I., on June 3, 1911, according to major film refererence works. However, news agencies yesterday quoted municipal employees in Ronco as giving her birth year of record as 1905. Her parents separated in her childhood, and she later chose her mother's maiden name, Goddard.         She left school early and became a Powers model and then a Ziegfeld Girl. She was briefly married to Edgar W. James, a lumber industrialist, and soon sought fame in Hollywood. She played a series of chorus and other bit parts, joined the Hal Roach stock company and met Mr. Chaplin, from whom she became inseparable.         Miss Goddard's later film roles included ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940), ''Nothing But the Truth'' (1941), ''So Proudly We Hail'' (1943), ''Kitty'' (1946), ''Unconquered'' (1947) and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1949).         Her roles in the 1950's were disappointing, and, except for a 1964 Italian film, ''Time of Indifference,'' she lived in retirement with Mr. Remarque from the time of her marriage to the novelist in 1958 until his death. Her other marriges ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, Miss Vaughan influenced countless other singers - including Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade and Rickie Lee Jones - and made hits of such songs as ''It's Magic,'' ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' and ''Broken-Hearted Melody.'' Her ornate renditions of ''Misty'' and ''Send In the Clowns'' were invariable show-stoppers at jazz festivals in recent years, including the JVC Jazz Festival in New York, at which she appeared almost yearly.         Her voice remained remarkably unravaged by time; in her mid-60's, a period when most singers' vocal powers have sharply diminished, she was still close to her peak. Though her speaking voice deepened and darkened in later years, her singing retained a youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre, and she could still project delicate but ringingly high coloratura passages.         Where more idiosyncratic jazz artists like Billie Holiday excelled at interpretation, Miss Vaughan was a contralto who gloried in displaying the distinctive instrumental qualities of a voice that had a comfortable three-octave range and was marked by a voluptuous, heavy vibrato. Known for her dazzling vocal leaps and swoops, she was equally adept at be-bop improvisation and singing theater songs with a symphony orchestra. Among the singers of her generation, only Ella Fitzgerald enjoyed comparable stature.         ''She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,'' the singer Mel Torme said yesterday. ''So much so that I used to call her the diva. At one point, I asked her why she had never opted for an operatic career. She got kind of huffy, and said, 'Do you mean jazz isn't legit?' She was very defensive about being a jazz singer. Where someone like Benny Goodman was able to split his musical image and record Mozart concerts, she wanted to perform precisely where she was.''         Appropriate Nicknames         Throughout her career, Miss Vaughan was affectionately known as Sassy or the Divine Sarah. The first nickname reflected her sense of humor and the mischievous sexiness that often inflected her singing and stage patter. The second, appropriated from the legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt, acknowledged her phenomenonally versatile voice. Foremost among the singers Miss Vaughan admired was the soprano Leontyne Price, to whom she bore more than a passing vocal resemblance.         John S. Wilson, in a New York Times review of a Vaughan performance in 1957, credited the singer with ''what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.''         When Miss Vaughan appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in 1974 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, Mr. Wilson commented on the ''soaring highs and incredibly full lows'' she displayed in her opening numbers and summed up the conclusion of her concert as ''totally virtuosic.''         Sarah Lois Vaughan was born in Newark, on March 27, 1924. Her father was a carpenter and amateur guitarist and her mother a laundress and church vocalist. She studied the piano from the age of 7 and later took up the organ, and at age 12 she became the organist at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, where she was also a soloist in the choir.         Career Began on a Dare         She also enjoyed performing popular tunes at parties, and when friends urged her to enter an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in New York, she took the dare and won first prize in October 1942, singing ''Body and Soul.'' The singer Billy Eckstine heard her perform, and six months after winning the contest she was hired at his recommendation as a second pianist and singer with Earl (Fatha) Hines's big band, in which Mr. Eckstine was a vocalist and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were instrumentalists.         The following year, when Mr. Eckstine formed his own band - which featured Mr. Parker, Mr. Gillespie, Art Blakey and Miles Davis, among other jazz greats - Miss Vaughan went along, and remained with him for a year. After a two-month stint in John Kirby's jazz group in the winter of 1945-46, she began a solo career. Her early solo recordings - on which she performed songs like ''Lover Man'' in full-blown be-bop style, accompanied by Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie -helped establish her reputation as a jazz singer.         First Husband Was Her Manager         During an extended engagement at Cafe Society Downtown in New York City, Miss Vaughan met George Treadwell, a trumpet player, whom she married. He became her manager, and under his guidance she made the transition from jazz cult figure to popular singing star.         She had her first hit in late 1947 with ''Tenderly,'' for the small Musicraft label. The following year, her version of ''It's Magic,'' a song from the movie ''Romance on the High Seas,'' established her as a full-fledged pop star. In 1949, she signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, where she remained until 1954, recording mostly popular songs backed by studio orchestras. Out of more than a dozen hits she had on Columbia, the most successful was ''These Things I Offer You,'' in 1951. Although most of her Columbia hits were disposable pop confections, she also recorded many lasting standards. Columbia recently reissued a collection of 28 songs she recorded between 1949 and 1953.         When Miss Vaughan moved to the Mercury label in 1954, she was given the freedom to pursue a dual career as both a popular and jazz singer. For EmArcy, Mercury's jazz subsidiary, she recorded with Clifford Brown, Cannonball Adderley and members of Count Basie's Orchestra, among other jazz artists. On the parent label, she also scored a steady succession of hits for the rest of the decade.         Songs of Seduction         Two of her biggest successes, ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' (1954) and ''Whatever Lola Wants'' (1955), from the Broadway musical ''Damn Yankees,'' were songs of seduction in which her almost overripe timbre gave an extra edge of sensuality to come-hither messages. Her two other biggest hits were the title song of the Broadway show ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956) and ''Broken-Hearted Melody'' (1959), a ballad with a light rock-and-roll beat. Her complete output for Mercury -263 cuts - was recently reissued.         After 1959, Miss Vaughan would never have any commercially significant pop hits. But over the next 30 years, her reputation as consummate vocal artist soared steadily, thanks to her appearances in nightclubs, at jazz festivals and increasingly with symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad.         During the 1960's, she recorded briefly with Roulette, then again with Mercury and Columbia, and in the 70's and early 80's she made albums for Mainstream and Pablo. It was for Pablo, run by the jazz producer Norman Granz, that she recorded the most critically acclaimed album of her career, ''How Long Has This Been Going On?'' in which she sang with a group that included Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown.         The singer's later recordings ranged from an album of Beatles tunes to a collection of Brazilian pop songs. On CBS's classical crossover recording of ''South Pacific,'' she sang the role of Bloody Mary, and on Quincy Jones's all-star pop-jazz album, ''Back on the Block,'' she and Ella Fitzgerald sang together on a version of Josef Zawinul's ''Birdland.'' In 1982 she won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, for her ''Gershwin Live!'' recording on CBS.         Two Perennial Offerings         Though Miss Vaughan's repertory during her 1980's appearances at the JVC Festival varied from year to year, two songs she would always perform were ''Misty,'' which she had first recorded in 1957 with Mr. Jones, and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which became her musical signature during the last decade of her life.         Living up to her Sassy sobriquet, the singer liked to perform ''Misty'' as a duet with herself, singing the first half in her regular voice, than dipping to the bottom of her contralto to do an amusing imitation of a seductive male lounge singer. ''Send In the Clowns,'' the song that usually closed her shows, became her ultimate vocal showpiece, a three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression. The performances invariably won standing ovations.         Mr. Jones, who first worked with Miss Vaughan in Paris in 1957 when they recorded the original vocal rendition of ''Misty,'' had recently signed her to record a Brazilian fusion album on his label, Qwest. ''Sarah was the most musical singer America has ever known,'' Mr. Jones said yesterday.         Miss Vaughan's marriage to Mr. Treadwell ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Clyde Atkins, a professional football player; Marshall Fisher, a Las Vegas restaurateur, and Waymon Reed, a trumpet player.         She is survived by her mother, Ada, and a daughter, Deborah Vaughan, who uses the first name Paris for her acting career. Both live in Los Angeles.         Miss Vaughan's body will be flown to Newark for a funeral service on Saturday at Mount Zion Baptist Church.

        Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lady Keith, known to her friends as Slim, had just completed her memoirs, ''Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life,'' which is to be published later this year by Simon & Schuster.         Known for her wit and charm, she was a sought-after guest, a close friend of Ernest Hemingway, the Selznicks and much of Hollywood and New York society. Truman Capote, who called her ''Big Mama,'' was one of her closest friends until he wrote ''Answered Prayers,'' an article that caricatured New York society. After the article was published in Esquire she never spoke to Mr. Capote again.         In her later years her circle of friends included Mike Nichols and Jerome Robbins.         Married Hawks and Hayward         A native of Salinas, Calif., she acquired her title from her third husband, Lord Kenneth Keith, a British merchant banker, whom she married in 1962.         She was Mary Raye Gross at her birth on July 15, 1916, but her mother changed her name to Nancy. She grew up to be the kind of beauty that was sought after in Hollywood, although she never appeared in films. In her early 20's she became a regular guest at San Simeon, the Hearst estate, and in 1941 Gary Cooper gave her away when she married Howard Hawks, the director and producer. Their daughter, Kitty Hawks, survives her.         In 1946, 150 fashion editors and stylists named ''Slim'' Hawks the best-dressed woman of the year. The runner-up was the Duchess of Windsor. At the time, Mrs. Hawks was quoted as saying, ''I have a tall, skinny frame that clothes look well on. Seriously, just say that I'm a great believer in simplicity in clothes.''         In her Hollywood years she was credited with discovering and promoting such stars as Lauren Bacall, Joanne Dru and Ella Raines, all of whom resembled her somewhat in their casual, long-limbed type of good looks.         Two days after she and Mr. Hawks were divorced in 1949, she married Leland Hayward, the movie and theatrical producer, at the Manhasset, L.I., estate of William S. Paley. She and Mr. Hayward divorced in 1959 and three years later she married Kenneth Keith. They were divorced in 1972. ''I was married to each for about 10 years,'' she said at the time. ''I guess that's about all I can hack.''         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Theodora Andersen, of Burlingame, Calif., and four stepchildren, Alastaire Keith and Camilla Mackesson, the children of Lord Keith, and William Hayward and Brooke Hayward Duchin.       
        Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         In 1979, when she was 83 and was being honored in an exhibition of 10 outstanding 20th-century female photographers, she told an interviewer: ''If it had come 20 years ago, I might have been able to appreciate it. Now it's a strain. I have too much else to do.''         Mrs. Jacobi made her portraits in Germany and the United States over six decades. Her subjects included Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, the Soviet director Konstantin Stanislavsky, the theologian and philosopher Martin Buber, the actor and singer Paul Robeson, the poets Marianne Moore, W. H. Auden and Robert Frost, the cellist Pablo Casals, and the writers W. E. B. DuBois and Thomas Mann.         Miss Jacobi's portrait of the writer Theodore Dreiser is currently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, which has several Jacobi portraits in its collection, as do other museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Fourth Generation in the Art         Though best known for her portraits, between 1946 and 1955 she made a notable series of photo abstractions called ''Photogenics,'' experiments with light and shadow. She also photographed street scenes in New York, nature scenes in New Hampshire, and people and landscapes in the Soviet Union, Central Asia and her native Germany.         Miss Jacobi was born in Thorn, West Prussia. Her great-grandfather, Samuel Jacobi, learned photography from Louis Daguerre, who gave his name to an early picture-making process. Her grandfather and father took up the camera in turn, and as a beginner she was encouraged to start out by making her own camera.         In Berlin she eventually specialized, photographing personalities in the arts, theater and dance. She moved to New York in 1935 and opened a studio with her sister, Ruth. She moved to Deering in 1955 and continued working actively through the 1970's. In 1981 she donated her archives, consisting of 47,000 negatives, to the University of New Hampshire.         She is survived by her sister, Ruth, who lives in a nursing home in Mission Viejo, Calif.       
        Grace Ford Salvatori, a philanthropist who was a leading fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Music Center, died on Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 80 years old.         Grace Ford Salvatori, a philanthropist who was a leading fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Music Center, died on Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 80 years old.         Mrs. Salvatori and her husband, Henry Salvatori, an industrialist, gave many gifts to schools, hospitals and shelters. But raising funds to build the music center was her proudest accomplishment, said her daughter, Laurie Ann O'Connell. The $34 million center, with three auditoriums, was built between 1962 and 1967.         Mrs. Salvatori also made major gifts to the University of Southern California, the Marlborough School, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, St. John's Hospital, the Hospital of the Good Samaritan and the Los Angeles Mission.         She was born in Oklahoma and came to Los Angeles hoping to become an actress. She spent a brief time under contract to MGM Studios. She and Mr. Salvatori were married in 1937.         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Salvatori is survived by a son, Henry Ford Salvatori, and a grandson.       
        Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known sopranos in the 1960's and 1970's, died of cancer on Friday, her family said. She was 52 years old.  Miss Harwood, who died at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London, specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and in the music of Mozart.         Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known sopranos in the 1960's and 1970's, died of cancer on Friday, her family said. She was 52 years old.  Miss Harwood, who died at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London, specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and in the music of Mozart.         Her mother, a professional soprano, gave her singing lessons when she was a child, and she later studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music.         She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in ''Die Zauberflote'' by Mozart at Glyndebourne in southern England. In 1963 she scored her first major success, as Countess Adele in Rossini's ''Count Ory.'' In 1960, she won Britain's prized Kathleen Ferrier memorial award for singing, and in 1965 was a winner of the Verdi Competition at Busseto in Italy.         Miss Harwood first appeared at the annual music festival in Salzburg, Austria, in 1970, singing the role of Constanze in Mozart's ''Abduction From the Seraglio'' and that of Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte.'' Returning to Salzburg in 1972, she sang the countess in a new production of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' conducted by Herbert von Karajan. He continued to invite her to Salzburg for several years.         In the late 1970's Miss Harwood's health declined. Her last performance was in November 1989 at the Bath Festival in western England. She married Julian Royle, a businessman, in 1966. The couple had one son.       
        Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and died on Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of death.  She was born Madge McHarg on in Melbourne, Australia. She grew up in London and became a journalist in the 1920's, first working for English Vogue with the novelist Aldous Huxley and the photographer Cecil Beaton, and later freelancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.         She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor in 1933.         During World War II, she became merchandising manager for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store here, and designed some fashion.         In 1948, she founded the first British school of fashion, at the invitation of the Royal College of Art. She remained at its head until 1956.         She produced five books on fashion and the history of costumes.         She was married in the 1920's to Capt. Ewart Garland. In 1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; they were divorced in 1962. She had no children.       
        Sari Biro, a Hungarian pianist who settled in the United States in 1939, died at St. Mary's Hospital in San Francisco on Sunday. She was 78 years old and lived in San Francisco.         Her daughter, Maria Warren Watts, said Miss Biro died of pneumonia.         Miss Biro was born in Budapest on March 24, 1912, and studied at the Franz Liszt Royal Academy of Music. When she was 11 years old, she performed on the program that inaugurated the Hungarian Broadcasting System. Radio and television later played an important part in her career. In the 1950's, she performed a series of 13 live radio recitals in New York, as well as nine televised recitals that were broadcast on educational television in San Francisco. She also made several recordings on the Remington label. In the 1980's, she frequently returned to Hungary to record programs for radio broadcasts.         Miss Biro gave her New York City debut recital in November 1940 at Town Hall. Reviewing the performance in The New York Times, Noel Strauss admired her ''ability to set forth lyric passages with exceptional beauty of singing tone and a haunting expressiveness.''         She toured the United States as a recitalist and concerto soloist, and in 1949 she played nine concertos in a three-concert series at Carnegie Hall. Besides standard repertory works, the series included the New York premiere of Darius Milhaud's Second Piano Concerto. She moved to San Francisco in 1958 and made her last New York appearance in 1972.         She is survived by her daughter and a granddaughter, Fiora Sari Watts of San Francisco.

        Irene Dunne had a ladylike gentility that made her naughty antics in sophisticated comedies all the more hilarious. In classic farces like ''The Awful Truth,'' in which she portrayed a worldly divorcee briefly inpersonating a gauche chorine, she delighted audiences and reviewers with her wit and elan.         Critics agreed that her artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. Miss Dunne was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and longtime popularity, an Oscar eluded her.         Colleagues regarded her as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., once a co-star, wrote that she was ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         Studied Music         Of Irish descent, Irene Dunne was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec 20. The year was 1904, according to most sources. Her father was a supervisory steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, an accomplished pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended a convent school, studied voice and piano with private teachers, sang in a church choir, attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and, after winning an arduous contest, was given a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors.         After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected for being, Miss Dunne recalled, ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in a number of minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, a milestone year, she was cast in the leading role of Magnolia for what became a hugely successful 72-week tour of Florenz Ziegfeld's production of ''Show Boat.''         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after a minor picture called ''Leathernecking'' and six months of drama lessons, she won the leading role of Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.''         Miss Dunne was cast for several years in such tragic and lachrymose roles as a hanidcapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a hugely popular tearjerker; a troubled wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she challenged a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 30's         By the mid-30's, her rich, warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline,'' the sparkling ''Roberta,'' ''Show Boat,'' and ''High, Wide and Handsome.''         Miss Dunne chose her vehicles with great care and won even greater popularity in effervescent and urbane madcap comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a daring book and tries to live up to it.In several other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying backtalk.         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her personal favorite of her 41 films.         The actress later received accolades for two major wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was the indestructible Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's King in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family in early 20th-century San Francisco in ''I Remember Mama.''         Active in Philanthropies         Miss Dunne was miscast in her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by the makeup she wore to play a frumpy elderly Queen Victoria. Her final film was ''It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952. In the 50's, she made occasional television appearances.         As her acting career became less demanding, Miss Dunne found other pursuits, away from the film industry. An active Republican, she was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairman of many philanthropies.         Miss Dunne was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter, Mary Frances.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria. In the 1950's, she made only occasional television appearances.         As she did less acting, she turned to other pursuits. She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS. ANNA         These are among the more than 40 films made by Irene Dunne during her 22-year film career:         Cimarron (1931)         Ann Vickers (1933)         Roberta (1935)         Magnificent Obsession (1935)         Show Boat (1936)         Theodora Goes Wild (1936)         The Awful Truth (1937)         Love Affair (1939)         My Favorite Wife (1940)         A Guy Named Joe (1943)         The White Cliffs of Dover (1944)         Anna and the King of Siam (1946)         Life With Father (1947)         I Remember Mama (1948)         The Mudlark (1950)       
        Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of arteriosclerotic heart disease, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Ascoli, a daughter of Julius Rosenwald, a Chicago clothier who was a chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company, devoted most of her adult life to charitable causes, many of them involving child welfare. She was the widow of Dr. Max Ascoli, the editor and publisher of The Reporter magazine, who died in 1978.         Mrs. Ascoli's principal interest was promoting health services for children. She was active with the Citizens Committee for almost four decades and served as its president from 1960 to 1962 and chairwoman from 1962 to 1964, when she stepped down and became head of the committee's health section, a post she held until 1981.         Married Housing Specialist         At her death Mrs. Ascoli was an honorary vice president of the committee. She was also a former president of the New York Fund for Children and, from 1948 to 1960, was president of the Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem.         Mrs. Ascoli, a native of Chicago, attended Wellesley College for a year before she married Alfred K. Stern, a housing specialist who later became chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. They were divorced in 1936. She married Dr. Ascoli in 1940.         Mrs. Ascoli, who lived in New York City for more than 50 years, moved to her summer home in Croton-on-Hudson seven years ago. Active in community affairs there, she gave 150 acres of her estate to the Teatown Lake Reservation, a conservation group.         Mrs. Ascoli is survived by two sons, Alfred R. Stern of Manhattan, and Peter M. Ascoli of Chicago; a brother, William Rosenwald of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Dorothy Perkins Freeman, who in 1960 donated her family estate in the Riverdale section of the Bronx to New York City to establish the Wave Hill arboretum and cultural center, died on Sunday at Miles Memorial Hospital in Damariscotta, Me. She was 99 years old and lived in Damariscotta.         Dorothy Perkins Freeman, who in 1960 donated her family estate in the Riverdale section of the Bronx to New York City to establish the Wave Hill arboretum and cultural center, died on Sunday at Miles Memorial Hospital in Damariscotta, Me. She was 99 years old and lived in Damariscotta.         Mrs. Freeman was born in Chicago, the daughter of George W. Perkins, a financier and partner in J. P. Morgan & Company. Her family moved to Manhattan in 1893, when she was 2 years old, and a decade later her father acquired the fieldstone house and grounds, known as Wave Hill, overlooking the Hudson River.         The house, built in 1830, had been occupied at various times by, among others, Theodore Roosevelt in his boyhood, Mark Twain and Arturo Toscanini. A second residence on the 20-acre estate, the red brick Perkins House, was built in the mid-1920's.         Mrs. Freeman and her husband, Edward Woolsey Freeman, moved into Wave Hill in the early 1930's. Three decades later, at the suggestion of Robert Moses, then New York City Parks Commissioner, the Freemans, joined by other heirs of Mrs. Freeman's mother, Evalina Ball, gave the estate to the city.         In 1962 the Freemans moved to Damariscotta, where they had established a second home in the 1920's. Mr. Freeman died in 1979.         Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Evelyn Scott of Montreal; two sons, George, of Holicong, Pa., and John, of Riverdale; 11 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.       
         Anya Seton, the author of several popular historical and biographical novels, two of which were made into successful films, died on Thursday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She had been ill for several years and died of heart failure, a daughter, Pamela Cottier Forcey, said.         Miss Seton developed a devoted following from the 1940's to the 1970's for her carefully researched and evocative works, two of which, "Dragonwyck" and "Foxfire," were made into successful films. She won critical praise for her attention to the language and life style of the periods she wrote about, but she was frequently faulted for reworking familiar ground.  A First Book at 37         The daughter of a celebrated English author, artist and naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, and an American writer of travel books, Grace Gallatin, Miss Seton did not produce her first successful book until she was 37 years old. She had married the first of her two husbands when she was 18 and raised three children before turning seriously to writing.         She began selling short stories to newspapers -- her first brought her a check for $5 -- and in the late 1930's became interested in the story of Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia, a celebrated beauty of her time who died mysteriously.         Miss Seton decided to apply a fictional treatment to the woman's life and the result was "My Theodosia," published in 1941 and well received by critics and the public.         "Dragonwyck," her second published novel, gained international recognition. A Gothic tale set along the Hudson River in the 1840's, it was serialized by the Ladies' Home Journal, selected by the Dollar Book Club, translated into nine languages and made into a film starring Vincent Price as a feudal overlord who tyrannizes his tenant farmers, kills his wife and takes up with a distant relative, played by Gene Tierney. Role for Vincent Price         The film, released in 1946, was adapted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was his first directorial effort; it established him as a major force in movies and set a villainous style for Mr. Price that he was to repeat many times.         That year Miss Seton followed with "The Turquoise," a novel of the American Southwest in the 1890's, inspired by visits to her father's ranch in New Mexico. Two years later came "The Hearth and the Eagle," set in Marblehead on the Massachusetts coast.         For each of her books, Miss Seton spent a good deal of time getting to know the locale about which she was writing.         "It is impossible for me to describe or 'feel' any place to which I have not been," she once said. "I am inspired by places." "Dragonwyck," "The Turquoise," "The Hearth and the Eagle" and "Foxfire," the latter set in an Arizona ghost town and made into a 1955 film starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, all resulted from visits to places which, Miss Seton said, "suddenly became meaningful." Dark Romances         But her favorite books were her biographical novels. Besides "My Theodosia" these included "Katherine" (1954), the story of the mistress of John of Gaunt; "The Winthrop Woman" (1958), about the niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, and "Devil Water" (1962), "Avalon" (1965) and "Green Darkness" (1973), all of which take place in England and tell of dark romances.         Miss Seton was born in Manhattan and raised in Cos Cob, Conn., where her family had an estate. She was christened Ann, but a family friend, a Sioux chief, gave her the Indian name Anutika, which her family adapted to Anya. She traveled extensively with her parents; by the time she was 13 she had crossed the Atlantic eight times. She had private tutors much of the time but graduated from the Spence School.         Miss Seton was twice married and divorced. Her son, Seton Cottier, died in 1979. She is survived by Mrs. Forcey, who lives in Manhattan, and another daughter, Clemency Chase Coggins of Auburndale, Mass.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.         Miss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in "Bulldog Drummond" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in "Disraeli" (1929) and John Barrymore in "Moby Dick" (1930).         She portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in "Me and My Gal" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in "Little Women" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in "Private Worlds" (1935).         The leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made "Algiers," a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called "Trade Winds," and she began an entirely new career.         A Change of Personality         Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- "The House Across the Bay" and "The Man I Married" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in "Man Hunt" (1941), a mysterious model in "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in "Scarlet Street" (1946).         She also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's "Macomber Affair" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's "Woman on the Beach" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's "Reckless Moment" (1949).         Then, easily shifting images again, she was an elegant, witty and nurturing mother in two classic film comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli: "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951), co-starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.         Later in 1951, Miss Bennett was a principal in a major Hollywood scandal. Mr. Wanger shot and wounded her longtime agent, Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot, accusing him of being a home wrecker. Miss Bennett later attributed her husband's outburst to desperation over large financial losses.         To avoid further notoriety, Mr. Wanger pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served 100 days at a minimum-security prison farm. Mr. Lang soon recovered, but Miss Bennett's film career did not. Before the shooting, she had starred in more than 60 movies. After it, at the age of 41, she was offered only a handful of roles.         Bad Timing         In a 1981 interview, she contrasted the judgmental 1950's with the sensation-crazed 70's and 80's. "It would never happen that way today," she said, laughing. "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures."         The Wangers divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage.         As movie offers dwindled, Miss Bennett turned to the stage and made successful national tours in such plays as "Susan and God," "Bell, Book and Candle," "Once More With Feeling," "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Never Too Late."         She also lent her presence and prestige to television's top gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," which ran from 1966 to 1971 and attracted a major cult following. The series, which also dealt with a guilt-ridden vampire (Jonathan Frid), has been frequently rebroadcast.         Associates invariably applauded Miss Bennett for professionalism and dedication. In her 1970 autobiography, "The Bennett Playbill," written with Lois Kibbee, she said her experience with "Dark Shadows," in which she played the mistress of a haunted mansion, had given her new regard for daytime television performers.         Miss Bennett was celebrated for not taking herself too seriously. In 1986, she remarked, "I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much."         Theatrical Lineage         Joan Bennett was born on Feb. 27, 1910, in Palisades, N.J. Her parents were Richard Bennett, a flamboyant matinee idol, and Adrienne Morrison, an actress whose lineage went back five generations to strolling players in 18th-century England. The couple's elder daughters, Constance and Barbara, also became actresses.         Miss Bennett attended St. Margaret's, a boarding school in Waterbury, Conn., and L'Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France. At the age of 16, she married John Marion Fox, whom she later described as a playboy and drunkard. At 17, she had a daughter, Diana, and at 18, she divorced Mr. Fox.         That same year, her father got her the ingenue role in a Broadway melodrama, "Jarnegan," in which he starred as a lecherous, brawling movie director. She received good notices, and after a five-month run, he helped her get her first movie contract. She soon succeeded in "Bulldog Drummond" and over the next decade starred in 33 films. Her major early setback was a final-round loss of the role of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh.         About Hollywood in the 1930's, Miss Bennett recalled: "The industry held a combination of nuts, talents, charlatans and geniuses, all of whom were learning, bumbling and creating with fury and innocence. The colorful types had a passionate love for the business, not just for the money. Today, it seems to me, it's strictly a big business, based on dollars and cents."         Miss Bennett is survived by her fourth husband, David Wilde, a former critic and publisher whom she married in 1973; four daughters, Diana Anderson of Los Angeles and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y., from her second marriage to Gene Markey, a film writer-producer whom she married in 1932 and divorced in 1937, and Stephanie Guest and Shelley Wanger, both of Manhattan, from her marriage to Mr. Wanger, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Alice Marble, a Californian who grudgingly gave up baseball and grew into America's No. 1 female tennis player by winning the United States women's amateur singles title four times between 1936 and 1940, died yesterday at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. Miss Marble, a longtime resident of Palm Desert, Calif., was 77 years old.         Miss Marble, who suffered from pernicious anemia, according to her sister-in-law, Bernice Marble of San Francisco, was admitted to the hospital on Saturday and died at 1:35 A.M. yesterday. A hospital spokesman, Randy Bevilacqua, gave no cause of death.         To achieve her stature as the golden-haired queen of women's tennis, Miss Marble had to overcome obstacles. Born on Sept. 13, 1913, in the lumber town of Beckwith in the Sierra Nevadas, she left with her parents and three brothers at the age of 5 to grow up in San Francisco, a chubby girl athlete, adept at boxing, baseball and basketball. Turned to Tennis at 15         Her athletic skills were not turned to tennis until the age of 15. The former Little Queen of Swat learned the game quickly in Golden Gate Park. After winning many junior tournaments in California, her progress was slowed in 1933 by a case of sunstroke after she played 108 games of tennis in one day at East Hampton, L.I.         Then, in 1934, she suffered a complete collapse during a French-American series of matches at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris, which led to a diagnosis of pleurisy. She required a year of rest in a sanitarium, causing her to miss most of the 1934 and 1935 seasons.         When she applied to play in the national amateur championship at Forest Hills in 1936, the tournament committee refused to accept her entry, saying she was unfit to play and might permanently jeopardize her health. But after practicing a week, Miss Marble persuaded the committee to accept her entry and she went on to win her first national championship. Ranked No. 1 in 1936-1940         As the No. 1-ranked woman from 1936 to 1940, she dominated the game. She won the United States singles title again in 1938, 1939 and 1940 and the women's singles at Wimbledon in 1939.         With Sarah Palfrey Fabyan she won the United States women's doubles championships from 1937 through 1940 and the mixed-doubles title with Gene Mako in 1936, with Donald Budge in 1938, with Harry Hopman in 1939 and with Bobby Riggs in 1940. At Wimbledon, she also won the women's doubles in 1938 and 1939 with Mrs. Fabyan and the mixed doubles with Budge in 1937 and 1938 and with Riggs in 1939.         In 1939, she had won the singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles at both Forest Hills and Wimbledon and in 1940 she was undefeated. As a member of four winning Wightman Cup teams in matches against Britain during the 1930's she lost only one match in singles and one in doubles. Aided by a Coach         After her illness, Miss Marble was aided by the coaching of Eleanor Tennant, who made changes in her strokes. Miss Marble played an all-out athletic game complete with strong volleys and smashes. She was also adept at the twist serve and possessed a strong backhand. She was unusually quick on her feet and used her speed to good advantage while attacking the net.         Jack Kramer, a member of the Tennis Hall of Fame, said yesterday of Miss Marble: "She was the lady who most changed the style of play for women. She introduced the aggressive and athletic style that has led down to the female stars of today like Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf."         "Alice Marble was a picture of unrestrained athleticism," said Billie Jean King. "She is remembered as one of the greatest women to play the game because of her pioneering style in power tennis. I also admired her tremendously because she always helped others." Became a Pro After 1940         After her conquests of 1939 and 1940, Miss Marble renounced her amateur standing and turned professional. Since there were no professional tournaments for women, she played a series of exhibitions until the outbreak of World War II, when she enlisted in the Hale America movement to assist in improving the physical condition of women and youngsters.         She also played exhibition tennis matches to entertain servicemen and to promote the sales of war bonds. She was inducted into the Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., in 1964 with Donald Budge, her former mixed-doubles partner.         In 1946 she published a book "The Road to Wimbledon." She said she wrote it "because of so many requests from friends and fans who asked me to tell them the secret of success." Autobiography to Be Published         After the war, she continued to play exhibition matches and give tennis clinics in the United States and abroad. She also designed sportswear and traveled as a lecturer.         Her autobiogrpahy, "Courting Danger," written with Dale Leatherman, is scheduled for publication in June 1991, by St. Martin's Press.         In it, according to Miss Leatherman, Miss Marble writes of her marriage to Joe Crowley, an Army pilot who was shot down and killed over Germany during World War II. She also told of accepting an assignment as a spy for Army Intelligence in 1945 to gather information in Switzerland about German financial accounts. During the operation, she was shot in the back, but was rescued by her military intelligence contact and recovered. She was told not to mention the operation to anyone after the war.         Asked at a news conference in 1984 if she had any regrets about her tennis career, Miss Marble said, "I did not get to see myself on television and I did not get to play the tie breaker."       
         Eugenia Delarova Doll, a ballerina with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and a dance and music patron, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Doll died of complications following surgery for a brain tumor, said Robert Fizdale, the pianist, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. Doll, born in St. Petersburg, left the Soviet Union in 1926. The next year she performed in Paris with the Folies-Bergere, where she met Leonide Massine, the choreographer and dancer, at the stage door and soon after became his second wife. The Massines moved to New York City in 1928 and danced at the Roxy Theater until 1931.         Mrs. Doll joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1933, dancing as Eugenia Delarova. She originated character roles in several ballets choreographed by Massine, then ballet master and a choreographer and dancer with the company. Among the roles were the Flower Girl in "Gaite Parisienne."  Opened a Flower Shop         The couple were divorced in 1938. Mrs. Doll opened a flower shop on Madison Avenue and appeared on Broadway as a dancer and actress in shows like "Simple Simon" and "The Lady Comes Across." She married Henri G. Doll, an industrialist, inventor and director of research and development at Schlumberger Ltd. Their house on East 78th Street became a second home for musicians and dancers from all over the world, particularly Russian emigres, who were befriended and helped by the Dolls.         Mrs. Doll was an enthusiastic balletgoer, who recommended to Massine that he hire "a fantastic dancer" named Jerome Robbins "to do all his parts," as she later put it. Mr. and Mrs. Doll later commissioned Mr. Robbins's "Other Dances."         This year, Mrs. Doll gave a total of $3 million to American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the School of American Ballet and the American Friends of the Paris Opera and Ballet. Mrs. Doll also contributed to the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Joffrey Ballet and the companies of Paul Taylor and Alvin Ailey, as well as the American Symphony Orchestra, Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the French Institute/Alliance Francaise. In 1986 she was named an Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government for her support of the Paris Opera Ballet.         Mrs. Doll is survived by her husband.

She gave recitals as a mezzo-soprano in Europe and in New York City after her arrival in 1940. In the 1960's and 70's, she was on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music and the Mannes College of Music. She continued teaching privately after her retirement.         Mrs. Gurewich's best-known students include the sopranos Martina Arroyo, Florence Quivar, Grace Bumbry, Sharon Sweet and Diana Soviero.

         Portland Hoffa, a comedian and the widow of the humorist Fred Allen, died Tuesday at her home in Los Angeles.         Her niece, Frances Hershkowitz of New York City, gave Miss Hoffa's age as 83 or 84 and said her aunt had died in her sleep.         In the 1920's, Miss Hoffa danced in the choruses of several Broadway productions, including "Bombo" and "Earl Carroll's Vanities." She met Allen in 1922 when they both appeared in "Passing Show," a Broadway revue. Miss Hoffa assisted Allen when he was a juggler in vaudeville, and by the time Allen began his half-hour comedy broadcast in 1932, the two were married. Her high-pitched voice was heard on the program regularly as she and Allen figuratively strolled down Allen's Alley, talking to the resident characters.         After Allen's death in 1956, Miss Hoffa married Joseph W. Rines, a band leader and advertising executive. He died in the mid-1980's.         In addition to her niece, Miss Hoffa is survived by her sisters, Lastone Hershkowitz of New York and Los Angeles and Frederika Bond of Bellingham, Wash.
