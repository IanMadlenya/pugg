         Tana Hoban, an accomplished photographer of children who turned her photography into an innovative kind of illustration for books for the youngest audiences, died on Jan. 27 at a hospice in suburban Paris. She was 88 and had been living in Paris for the last 23 years.         Her death was announced by her husband, Robert G. Morris, a photo editor, who said it followed a long illness.         Beginning in 1970, Ms. Hoban wrote, designed, illustrated and published 110 or more titles, a score of them in print, which won dozens of awards. Most were issued by Greenwillow Books, an imprint of the HarperCollins Children's Book Group.         They ranged from alphabet books, like ''A, B, See!'' (1982), to primers for life beyond the nursery, like ''26 Letters and 99 Cents'' (1986); from ''Circles, Colors and Squares'' (1974) to ''Is It Larger? Is It Smaller?'' (1985); ''More Than One'' (1981) to ''I Read Symbols'' (1984).         ''So Many Circles, So Many Squares'' (1998), illustrated with her photographs, educated children to simple geometric shapes. Other recent books, in print, were ''Let's Count'' (1999) and ''Cubes, Cones, Cylinders and Spheres'' (2000).         She offered young readers photo images of things they would encounter as they ventured forth, as in ''Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?'' (1995), with her text and photos. She did the same in telling about demolition and construction machinery in ''Construction Zone'' (1997).         Among Ms. Hoban's early works was an illustrated do-it-yourselfer, ''How to Photograph Your Child'' (Crown, 1953). She contributed to the Greystone Encyclopedia of Photography (1963), and her pictures appeared in books by other authors as well.         Tana Hoban was born in Philadelphia and graduated in 1938 from the School of Design for Women, which is now Moore College of Art and Design. She won a scholarship that took her to England and the Netherlands, and soon turned to magazine illustration and photography.         Her photographs of children prompted Edward Steichen to display them at the Museum of Modern Art for the first of various exhibitions mounted in Philadelphia, New York, Paris and Berlin. In 1970 she progressed from photographs of children to photographs for children.         Ms. Hoban's first marriage, to Edward E. Gallob, a photographer, ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Morris, whom she married 23 years ago, she is survived by a daughter from the earlier marriage, Miela Ford of Rochester; a brother, the writer Russell Hoban, of London; a granddaughter; and one great-granddaughter.         ''My books are about everyday things that are so ordinary that one tends to overlook them,'' Ms. Hoban once wrote about her work. ''I try to rediscover these things and share them with children. But there is more to each picture than a first look reveals. I always try to include something new, something to reach for.''         Correction:  February 6, 2006, Monday  An obituary on Saturday about Tana Hoban, a photographer and an illustrator of children's books, misstated the given name of her husband. He is John G. Morris, not Robert Morris.       
         Stella Snead, a British Surrealist painter and collage artist who fled wartime Europe to work in the United States and later became a photographer noted for her books on India, died on March 18 in New York. She was 96.         Her dealer, Pavel Zoubok, said she died of natural causes at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan.         Ms. Snead's paintings of the 1940's -- nocturnal, dreamlike landscapes populated by fantastic animals and semi-human creatures -- reflected the influences of painters like Yves Tanguy and Max Ernst. Though not well remembered as a painter today, Ms. Snead exhibited her work frequently in the United States and Europe during that decade. In 1949, her work was included in the prestigious Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh.         But in the 1950's, she abruptly stopped painting. The reason was depression, she later wrote in a reminiscence. She had suffered bouts of it before, she wrote, and now the breakup of a romantic relationship had set off another episode, draining her of her desire to paint. So she turned to photography.         In India, where she began making extended visits and where she lived throughout the 1960's, she took photographs of street life, nature and Hindu sculpture. She published eight books of photography, including ''Shiva's Pigeons: An Experience of India'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972) and ''Animals in Four Worlds: Sculptures from India'' (University of Chicago Press, 1989).         Stella Snead was born on April 2, 1910, in London. It was not until she was in her mid-20's that she decided to become a painter. She studied with the French abstract painter Amédée Ozenfant, who had opened an art school in London in 1936. The English Surrealist painter Leonora Carrington was a fellow student and a close friend.         In 1939, with the outbreak of war against Germany, Ms. Snead moved to the United States. She lived mainly in New York City and Taos, N.M., for the next decade. After returning from India in 1971, she resided permanently in Manhattan. She had no immediate survivors.         In the 60's and 70's, Ms. Snead produced collages from cut-up pieces of her own photographs. Some were published in a book, ''Can Drowning Be Fun? A Nonsense Book'' (Pont la Vue Press, 1992). And in the late 80's, after a hiatus of more than three decades, she began painting again, making copies from photographs of old paintings that had been lost or stolen.         Recognition also returned to her in her later years. Last year, one of her paintings from the 1940's was included in ''Surrealism USA,'' a major survey of American Surrealists at the National Academy Museum in New York.       
         Joan Diener, whose lush beauty, showstopping stage presence and operatic voice made her a favorite in musicals, especially in the original 1965 ''Man of La Mancha'' as well as its revivals as late as 1992, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was complications from cancer, her daughter, Jennifer Marre, said.         Ms. Diener was best known for her role as Dulcinea in ''La Mancha,'' a musical version of ''Don Quixote'' by Cervantes, with music by Mitch Leigh and lyrics by Joe Darion.         Ms. Diener, a blonde, played the brunette country wench Aldonza, who becomes the princess Dulcinea in the fevered imaginings of Cervantes's knight errant. (Sophia Loren played the role in the 1972 film version.)         Ms. Diener said she was grateful for the work because it was a showcase for her vocal range and saved her from being typecast as a blonde.         In 1965, when she was 35 and starring in ''La Mancha,'' Ms. Diener told an interviewer that when she was first noticed as a young actress, the only offers she received were for ''the Jayne Mansfield-type part.''         ''And really that's so foreign to me,'' she said. ''I don't do it well. If I'd had to work, I'd have taken them. But since I was married and wanted a family, I could afford to wait.''         Born in Columbus, Ohio, on Feb. 24, 1930, Ms. Diener attended Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., where she majored in psychology and moonlighted as a stage actress.         A Life magazine photographer noticed her in a bit part in the 1950 comedy ''Season in the Sun'' and she was prominently featured in the magazine. The publicity led to more parts and eventually to a featured role in ''Kismet,'' the 1953 musical set in old Baghdad. ''As an abandoned hussy, brazenly made up and loosely clad, Joan Diener looks like a fine case of grand arson,'' Brook Atkinson wrote in The New York Times.         But the production was troubled; Ms. Diener left a London production in 1955 under disputed circumstances. In 1965, after a 12-year absence on Broadway, she opened in ''Man of La Mancha,'' directed by her husband, Albert Marre, who had also directed ''Kismet.''         ''La Mancha'' began at the ANTA Washington Square Theater and then moved to Broadway. ''Joan Diener's performance is a puzzle,'' John S. Wilson wrote in The Times in his review of the original cast recording. ''She has plenty of voice when she chooses to open up in operatic style. Most of the time, however, she uses a rather flat, colorless manner of singing. ''         Still, Ms. Diener remained a favorite of audiences and producers, starring in ''La Mancha'' revivals in Los Angeles and New York. In the last weeks of a 1992 Broadway production, she succeeded Sheena Easton, the pop singer, who had left the show.         In addition to Ms. Marre and three grandsons, all of Brooklyn, Ms. Diener is survived by her husband and a son, Adam Marre, both of Manhattan.       
         Diane Shamash, the founder and executive director of Minetta Brook, a nonprofit art organization that helped bring the artist Robert Smithson's quixotic ''Floating Island'' project to life last year and sent it circumnavigating Manhattan for nine days, died on Sunday at her home in Brooklyn Heights. She was 51.         The cause was cervical cancer, said her husband, Joseph Bartscherer, a photographer.         Ms. Shamash was born in Manhattan and maintained a love for the city's waterfront and for the Hudson Valley that motivated much of the work of Minetta Brook, named after a stream that once ran through what is now Greenwich Village.         Besides the ''Floating Island'' project -- an artificial island inspired partly by Central Park that Mr. Smithson sketched before he died in 1973 -- the organization also created ''Watershed,'' a project in which 10 artists built site-specific works in the Hudson Valley, and ''Riverrun,'' an exhibition of film and video works projected onto the facade of the Holland Tunnel Ventilation Building in Lower Manhattan in 2002.         Ms. Shamash described ''Floating Island,'' made in conjunction with the Whitney Museum of American Art, as the most complicated and challenging project her organization had ever taken on. She saw it as a kind of answer to ''The Gates,'' the massive public art project created in Central Park in early 2005 by Christo and Jeanne-Claude.         Though she told few people, Ms. Shamash was battling cancer and had recently undergone radiation and chemotherapy when ''Floating Island'' entered its construction stage at a barge yard in Staten Island, where tons of dirt, trees and rocks were moved in under her supervision and that of Nancy Holt, Mr. Smithson's widow.         Ms. Shamash, wearing a hard hat and safety vest, employed a mix of implacable friendliness and steely resolve to keep the project on track day after day.         ''The only pity about this,'' she said as she watched the island materialize last September, ''is that Smithson isn't going to get to see it built.''         Before founding Minetta Brook, Ms. Shamash was the public art program manager for the Seattle Arts Commission, which produced several projects on that city's streets and along its waterfront.         A 1981 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in visual studies, she also worked as the curator of modern art at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in California and as a gallery director for the Minneapolis Society of Fine Art.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Max, and her sister, Beba Shamash of Manhattan.       
         Beth Levine, an innovative American shoe designer whose boots, as Nancy Sinatra sang while wearing them, were made for walking, died on Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was lung cancer, said her niece, Nan Bush, the wife and producing partner of the photographer Bruce Weber.         Mrs. Levine designed shoes for 30 years under the label Herbert Levine, named for her husband, and was known as America's First Lady of Shoe Design because of her prominence in 20th-century fashion, and because her designs were worn by the American first ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy.         She made shoes for Barbra Streisand in ''Funny Girl'' and the white stiletto boots worn by Nancy Sinatra to sing ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.'' Mrs. Levine had reignited a trend for boots in the 1960's with her stretchy stocking styles and vinyl Go-Go boots, designed for dancing, (or walking all over you). When Ms. Sinatra released her anthem of women's empowerment in 1966, she was shown in film made for early video jukeboxes wearing the style from Herbert Levine. The song increased the demand for fashion boots so much that Saks Fifth Avenue opened a corner in its shoe department called Beth's Bootery.         ''She was among the most influential shoe designers of the century,'' said Elizabeth Semmelhack, the chief curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, who included Mrs. Levine in an exhibition this year called ''Icons of Elegance.''         ''In looking at 20th-century shoe design, she was in many ways a maverick mind,'' Ms. Semmelhack said. ''She saw the possibilities in all sorts of new materials and different ways of making a shoe.''         Mrs. Levine's designs were known for their poetic whimsy: She lined a sandal with an insole of Astroturf and affixed a plastic flower to its toe straps, and she designed heels made of rolled leather or silver thread that looked like a spool.         One of Mrs. Levine's most fanciful ideas, though it did not catch on, was the ''upper-less shoe,'' which was merely the sole of a high-heeled shoe with an adhesive insole that attached to the bottom of the foot. Her most outrageous designs -- driving shoes made to look like race cars, elaborately carved wooden blocks that looked like birds in flight and evening shoes that looked like Aladdin's lamp -- were included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1976, when she and her husband retired.         Beth Katz Levine was born on Dec. 31, 1914, in Patchogue, N.Y., the third of five children of Anna and Israel Katz, Lithuanian immigrants who operated a dairy farm. In the 1930's, she moved to Manhattan and found work as a shoe model (her feet were size 4B), then worked her way up from a stylist to head designer for I. Miller.         After working for the Red Cross in World War II, she applied for a job in 1944 designing shoes for another shoe manufacturer. She met Herbert Levine, who was running that company, and married him three months later.         Mr. Levine died in 1991. Mrs. Levine is survived by a daughter, Anna Thomson-Wilson, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Levine once said: ''My mother always thought a fine pair of shoes was a necessity. And my father dealt with horses and cows, so I knew about leather.''         In 1948, the couple started a business under the name Herbert Levine. Mrs. Levine wrote in a letter to the Bata Shoe Museum this year: ''We wanted to create a shoemaking niche. We were making very pretty shoes that nobody needed, but everybody wanted.''         Mrs. Levine was given the Coty Award in 1967, for design innovations that overcame traditional boundaries of footwear. In the 1950's, European designers had created a demand for mules, but they were difficult for women to walk in without crunching their toes to keep them on. Mrs. Levine's solution was a strip of elastic that caused the heel of the mule to flip upward as a woman walked, maintaining the tension between the ball of the foot and the heel. She called her invention the Spring-O-Later.         ''Clothes designers have gravity on their side,'' Mrs. Levine said. ''But shoe designers work upside down. Ideas are easy to come by. Getting them realized is something else.''         Although she worked closely with fashion designers to create shoes that would match their clothes, including a regular collaboration with James Galanos, Mrs. Levine was often a vocal critic of their work. Even after her retirement, she would call the designer Helmut Lang after his show to tell him what she liked and what she did not.         Ms. Bush once recalled introducing her aunt to Gianni Versace at a restaurant. ''The first thing she said was: 'You should be ashamed of yourself. Some of those clothes you make are really degrading to women,' '' Ms. Bush said. ''But by the end of the night, they were friends.''       
         Martha Holmes, a photographer for Life magazine for 40 years, who was known for her intimate portraits but also for covering sports at a time when that was male turf, died on Sept. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The death was confirmed by her son-in-law, John Koshel.         Hired by Life in 1944 when she was 20, Ms. Holmes was one of five women who were photographers at the magazine during its glory decades as the nation's most popular publisher of photography.         She worked in Hollywood, Washington and New York -- for five years on staff and for 35 years as a freelancer -- capturing images of movie stars like Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Van Johnson, Joan Crawford and John Garfield, and of public figures like the union leader John L. Lewis, caught in a scowl, and Eleanor Roosevelt sipping tomato juice.         ''She had a talent for extracting the best from people,'' said Bobbi Burrows, the director of photography for Life Books and an editor at the magazine for 40 years. ''She brought intimacy out of her subjects; people felt they were in good hands.''         Perhaps Ms. Holmes's most famous image is of the abstract painter Jackson Pollock, taken at his home studio in East Hampton, N.Y., for the issue of Aug. 8, 1949. It shows Pollock crouching over a canvas with paint cupped in his right hand, demonstrating his technique for applying an unbroken stream of black enamel, a cigarette dangling from his mouth.         In 1999 the photograph was the model for a 33-cent postage stamp. The Postal Service hired an artist, Howard Koslow, to copy it -- telling him to leave out the dangling cigarette, in the interest of public health.         Another well-known photo by Ms. Holmes, taken in 1947 during the Hollywood blacklist era, shows Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Danny Kaye in the audience at a hearing of the House Un-American Activities Committee, looks of concern on their faces.         Ms. Holmes's son-in-law, Mr. Koshel, said he once showed her the picture and suggested that it was an indication of her political point of view.         ''Martha remarked, 'No, I just saw Bogey was upset,' '' he said.         Martha Louise Holmes was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 7, 1923. Her father, George Holmes, worked in public relations; her mother, Emma Auer Holmes, was a voice coach. Ms. Holmes is survived by two daughters, Anne Waxman of Manhattan and Terry Koshel of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and two grandchildren. Her husband of 46 years, Arthur Waxman, died in 1998.         Ms. Holmes became interested in photography as teenager. She attended the University of Louisville for a year, but then was hired as a photo lab assistant at The Louisville Courier-Journal. Soon after, she was given a three-month trial as a cub photographer.         Two years later a Life photographer noticed her work and recommended that the magazine hire her. One of her first assignments was to cover the Kentucky Derby, where a male photographer shoved her aside. She later said she just elbowed him in the chest.         Ms. Burrows said Ms. Holmes's favorite photo, taken in 1949, is of the jazz singer Billy Eckstine surrounded by grinning female fans, one with her head on his chest.         ''It was groundbreaking back then in that it was a black man hugging a white woman,'' Ms. Burrrows said. ''There was a discussion about whether we should run it or not.'' An editor took the print to Henry R. Luce, Life's publisher, Ms. Burrows said. ''And Mr. Luce said, 'Run it.' ''         In 1953 Ms. Holmes was the subject of a sports-page article in The Louisville Times. Headlined ''Gal Sent to Cover Marciano Camp,'' it tells how she was assigned to shoot the heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano at his training camp at Grossinger's resort in the Catskills. In the article Ms. Holmes tells how an assignment editor at Life looked around, pointed and said, ''You.''         ''Who, me?'' Ms. Holmes recalled saying.         ''Yes, you're a photographer, aren't you?'' the editor said.       
         Elizabeth Allen, a leading actress on Broadway and in movies who got her start as the ''Away we go!'' girl on ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' in the 1950's, died Sept. 19 in Fishkill, N.Y. She was 77.         The cause was kidney failure, her sister-in-law, Marion Gillease, said.         Ms. Allen played major roles in five Broadway shows and in six movies, appeared on numerous television shows, including ''Kojak'' and ''Mannix,'' and sang at the Stork Club in New York. She was twice nominated for Tony Awards: in 1962 for best featured actress in a musical in ''The Gay Life,'' and in 1965 for best actress in a musical in ''Do I Hear a Waltz?''         Elizabeth Ellen Gillease was born on Jan. 25, 1929, in Jersey City, the daughter of Viola and Joseph Gillease. Her marriage in 1953 to a German baron, Karl von Vietinghoff-Scheel, ended in divorce. She left no immediate survivors.         As a teenager, Ms. Gillease, a tall, willowy brunette, was noticed by a photographer as she walked on Madison Avenue. That led to a five-year career as a fashion model. In 1953, she tried out for a bit part on the Gleason show and was chosen instead to introduce the program with what became its trademark proclamation, ''And away we go!''         While on the Gleason show, Ms. Allen also worked as a costume designer for a production of ''Hamlet'' by the Helen Hayes Equity Group. One day, Ms. Allen recalled, Ms. Hayes noticed that she unwaveringly would watch every rehearsal and said to her, ''I think you're in the wrong end of the business.'' Ms. Allen began playing roles with the company's national touring troupe.         Her big break came on a Saturday night in October 1957. While working in an industrial show in Detroit, Ms. Allen received a phone call asking her to return to New York to read for the role of Juliet in the Peter Ustinov comedy ''Romanoff and Juliet.'' The show was scheduled to open in five days, but there had been difficulty with the actress cast as Juliet. Ms. Allen had been recommended by Jack Manning, the director of the Hayes touring troupe.         She flew to New York on a Sunday and read for Mr. Ustinov and the producer David Merrick on Monday. Wherever she went during the next three days, including while her hair was being dyed red, she was trailed by someone helping her memorize the script. On Thursday night, the show opened.         Ms. Allen's Broadway roles and television appearances led to her Hollywood career. Among other major film roles, she played in ''Diamond Head'' with Charlton Heston, in ''Donovan's Reef'' with John Wayne and in ''From the Terrace'' with Paul Newman.         In 1965, Ms. Allen received her best-actress Tony nomination for the role of Leona Samish in Richard Rodgers's musical ''Do I Hear a Waltz?,'' about an American secretary seeking, but not quite finding, romance while on vacation in Venice.         ''I hated being remembered as the 'Away we go!' girl,'' Ms. Allen once said. ''Now I love it, because so many people liked it. It's flattering.''       
         Ruth Bernhard, whose classical black-and-white photographs of the female nude and inanimate objects earned her a place of distinction among 20th-century photographers, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 101.         The San Francisco medical examiner's office said her death was of natural causes.         Ms. Bernhard was known primarily for her dramatically lighted nude studies, which expressed her interest in abstract shape and form. ''My quest, through the magic of light and shadow, is to isolate, to simplify and to give emphasis to form with the greatest clarity,'' she said. ''To indicate the ideal proportion, and reveal sculptural mass and the dominating spirit, is my goal.''         In 1935 a chance meeting with the photographer Edward Weston on the beach in Santa Monica, Calif., altered the course of Ms. Bernhard's life. He became her mentor, and she studied with him for years. Seeing his pictures for the first time, she said, was a revelation. ''It was lightning in the darkness,'' she said. ''Here before me was indisputable evidence of what I had thought possible -- an intensely vital artist whose medium was photography.''         In the 1940s Ms. Bernhard became part of Group f/64, joining Modernist West Coast photographers like Weston, Ansel Adams, Minor White, Imogen Cunningham, Wynn Bullock and Dorothea Lange. All took a purist approach to their subjects. Their work is characterized by photographic clarity and detailed precision.         Weston's influence, in particular, on Ms. Bernhard's work is evident from the compositional simplicity of his own nude studies and still lifes of organic objects like shells and peppers.         Ms. Bernhard photographed almost exclusively in the studio. She was known to take a single picture from one specific angle after setting up a composition meticulously, sometimes over days.         ''If I have chosen the female form in particular, it is because beauty has been debased and exploited in our sensual 20th century,'' she told Margaretta K. Mitchell, author of ''Ruth Bernhard: Between Art and Life'' (2000). ''Woman has been the subject of much that is sordid and cheap, especially in photography. To raise, to elevate, to endorse with timeless reverence the image of woman has been my mission.''         She supported herself by holding private classes in her studio and leading workshops. She published several books of photographs, and her work is in collections at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.         Ruth Bernhard was born in Berlin in 1905. Her parents, Lucian and Gertrud, divorced when she was 2, and her father brought her up with the help of two teachers, both women, in their 40s. A graphic designer and typographer, her father was known for designing the font Bernhard, which is still in use. He married again and had four children. Two half-brothers -- Karl, of Afton, N.Y., and Alexander, of London -- survive her.         Ms. Bernhard followed her father to New York in 1927 after she completed two years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. She began photographing the female nude in the early 1930s and eventually became acquainted with Berenice Abbott and her artistic circle. She also supported herself with commercial photographic assignments.         In the early 1940s Ms. Bernhard became involved with an artist and designer, Eveline Phimister, and for the next 10 years they lived together in New York, then in Carmel, Calif.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco, which became Ms. Bernhard's permanent home in 1953.         In 1967 she became involved with an Air Force colonel, Price Rice, 10 years her junior. She remained with him until his death in 1999. Ms. Bernhard talked openly in Ms. Mitchell's book about her many affairs with men and women. ''I allowed life to give me presents,'' she told Ms. Mitchell. ''And everything just sort of happened the way it was supposed to happen. I did not pursue anything. It more or less pursued me.''
