         Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose stewardship of the Brearley School and then Barnard College made her a national role model for generations of young women who wanted to combine career and family, died on Wednesday at her home in Tyringham, Mass. She was 102.         An outspoken feminist in the 1940's and 50's before feminism became popular, Mrs. McIntosh was the first married woman to head one of the seven top women's colleges known as the Seven Sisters and became a national icon.         ''She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president, said at a gathering in 1998 at the McIntosh Student Center to mark Mrs. McIntosh's centennial birthday. She said Mrs. McIntosh, a campus legend, was a pioneer in exploring ''the struggle of both women and men to find their true roles in a changing world.''         Leora Hanser, Barnard student government president at the time of the celebration, said Mrs. McIntosh ''came from a different era, but the work and family issue is really very important, and a lot of Barnard students struggle with this today.''         In her long career, Mrs. McIntosh spoke and lectured widely, spreading ideas about women, education and child-rearing that would become popular 20 or 30 years later.         ''Having both a job and a family broadens one's perspective, which in turn makes a great contribution to a happy home life,'' she told the American Association of University Women in 1950.         She called for child care to be elevated to a dignified profession so working mothers could leave children in capable hands. And she attacked the conditioning that led young girls to feel they must subordinate their own interests when they were with boys, or to use the ''foolish technique'' of pretending they were stupid to be popular.         For anyone doubting that it could be done, Mrs. McIntosh was also the ultimate role model as she juggled marriage, five children (including twins) and her own career. Newsweek magazine viewed that as so remarkable that it put her on its cover in 1951.         But Mrs. McIntosh was less didactic than some later feminists. Even as she urged young women to participate in politics and community service and careers, she warned them that combining career and family meant pushing out nearly everything else. And she portrayed family life as a cornerstone of society and democracy, adding that in the face of conflict, family must take precedence.         ''You must be prepared to sacrifice many of your social contacts until your family is full grown,'' she said, ''and must always remember that your home comes before all else.''         She also respected the idea that happiness could come in many ways. Personal fulfillment ''may or may not lie in a career,'' she told The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. ''What is important is for each individual to order her life so that she becomes a happy, creative person.''         Her approach to life was rooted in common sense and a lack of pretense, physically and intellectually. A small, trim woman, she often wore plain suits without decoration. As a college president, she swept her own vestibule and weeded her own garden. And when she was honored after 10 years as chief of Barnard, she agreed on the condition that there be no speeches, no gifts and no flowers.         She also disliked honorifics. She preferred ''Mrs.'' to Dean and was often referred to as ''Mrs. Mac.'' When Barnard officials referred to her in news releases as ''Dr.,'' she chided them, saying, ''There is only one doctor in our family,'' referring to her husband, Dr. Rustin McIntosh, a pediatrician who taught at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.         Mrs. McIntosh saw education in its broadest sense, from conjugating irregular Greek verbs to sex education, as the way to prepare young women for the complicated balancing act she was urging on them. She believed that the education of young women for motherhood was society's ''most important task.''         At a time when few women were represented in the boardrooms of major American corporations, Mrs. McIntosh was a director of several companies, schools, foundations and civic groups.         After her retirement in 1962, she and her husband moved to their farm in Tyringham, Mass. Her husband died in 1986. Mrs. McIntosh is survived by a daughter, Susan Lloyd of Tinmouth, Vt.; 4 sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich., R. Carey, of Tyringham, Kenneth of West Newton, Mass., and J. Richard, of Boulder, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.         Millicent Carey McIntosh was born on Nov. 30, 1898, in Baltimore, the daughter of Anthony Morris Carey, who ran a machinery supply business, and the former Margaret Cheston Thomas, both active Quakers. She had five brothers and sisters, and all were taught to mend and darn and market and cook.         Her feminist notions were shaped by strong role models in her family. Her mother fought for women's suffrage, racial equality and prison reform. Her aunt, M. Carey Thomas, was a pioneer in women's education, a founder of the Bryn Mawr School (a girls' school in Baltimore) and president of Bryn Mawr College.         At Bryn Mawr, young Millicent played water polo and basketball and majored in Greek and English, graduating magna cum laude. She organized clubs for factory workers before accepting her aunt's offer of a year of study abroad.         After studying economics at Cambridge and English at Johns Hopkins University (where she did her doctoral thesis on 14th-century English mystery dramas), Mrs. McIntosh became an instructor at Bryn Mawr College. But she quickly was appointed dean of freshmen and then acting dean of the college.         She left Bryn Mawr to became headmistress at the Brearley School, the private girls school in Manhattan, from 1930 to 1947, and converted it from a half-day format to a full day. When she arrived, she asked her students to help plan the ''ideal school'' with the fewest possible rules. She worked without a desk because she felt that a desk intimated students. She introduced aptitude tests and remedial instruction and instituted a sex education course for sixth graders, which she taught.         In 1932, after she married Dr. McIntosh, her aunt discouraged her retirement, telling her, ''You can have your babies in August.'' At Brearley, she had five children. (She took to wearing academic robes to cover pregnancies.)         She was a hands-on manager, both at school and at home. She left detailed instructions for her household: menus, shopping lists, activities for the children. And every morning, she called Brearley to specify a hymn for morning assembly.         In late 1946, before Barnard had its own president (she was given the title in 1952), Mrs. McIntosh was chosen from more than 60 candidates to succeed Virginia Gildersleeve as Barnard's dean. It was a life that left few free minutes, but Mrs. McIntosh grabbed every one. She signed correspondence during intermissions at concerts and took her secretary with her to the beauty parlor so she could give dictation.         An administrator who valued good teaching, Mrs. McIntosh was dismayed that teachers were paid less than secretaries and dedicated some of Barnard's endowment for faculty salaries.         She also valued merit, and directed another part of the Barnard endowment to scholarships to open Barnard's doors to ''still more girls of superior talent regardless of their ability to pay.''         As she balanced career and home, Mrs. McIntosh acknowledged both her husband's support and good household help (which at one point included a governess, a cook and two daily helpers). She also respected the individuality of her children, keeping each in a separate school until one year, after attending five separate Christmas pageants, she said, ''I thought if I heard one more 'Silent Night' I would break down.'' Their schooling was consolidated.         At Barnard, she continued to teach: English and modern living, a required class that sought to help students think through their lives. She also presided over a $10 million fund-raising campaign.         John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rarely contributed to development funds, agreed to give Barnard $1 million, he told Mrs. McIntosh, ''because of my confidence in the exceptional vision and leadership you are bringing to the college.''         Even after she retired from Barnard, the trustees continued to consult her. In 1971, when men's and women's colleges everywhere were going coeducational and Barnard was facing pressure to merge into Columbia, Barnard's chairwoman, Eleanor Elliott, turned to Mrs. McIntosh, who suggested that the trustees try to answer three questions: Would a merger produce better education for Barnard and Columbia? Would relations between Barnard women and Columbia men be improved? And would a merger create economies for both colleges?         ''Mrs. Mac's questions helped organize our thinking simply and calmly,'' Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, ''and of course, we felt stronger.''       
         Dr. Dorothy M. Horstmann, an epidemiologist, virologist, polio pioneer and the first woman appointed as a professor at the Yale School of Medicine, died on Jan. 11 in New Haven. She was 89.         She had Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. I. George Miller, a colleague and professor of virology at Yale.         Dr. Horstmann died as the World Health Organization was on the verge of eradicating polio and four days after the death of Dr. Joseph L. Melnick of Houston, another polio pioneer with whom she worked and wrote scholarly papers.         Dr. Horstmann made significant scientific, educational and public health contributions, and her major scientific achievement was showing that the polio virus reached the brain by way of the blood, a finding that upset dogma and helped make polio vaccines possible.         ''The widely held feeling that the virus grew solely in nerve cells had to be set aside,'' said Dr. John F. Enders, who won a Nobel Prize for developing a technique that allowed the polio virus to be grown in cells.         At the time, scientists believed that the polio virus directly attacked the nervous system because efforts to isolate the virus from the blood of paralyzed patients had failed. The reason they failed became apparent when Dr. Horstmann's team detected the polio virus in the blood of infected monkeys and chimpanzees before signs of paralysis appeared. They found that by the time paralysis developed, antibodies had eliminated the polio virus from the blood.         At Dr. Horstmann's 70th birthday party, Dr. Enders said that ''obviously, the disease behaved like many viral infections'' and that ''everyone was relieved to find that poliomyelitis was not an exceptionally bizarre disease, but similar to others.''         Dr. Horstmann's work contributed to the licensing of an oral polio vaccine developed by Dr. Albert B. Sabin from live, weakened virus. The vaccine was tested among millions of people in what was then the Soviet Union. But in 1959, Western scientists were skeptical about the favorable findings reported by Russian, Polish and Czech health workers.         The World Health Organization then asked Dr. Horstmann to study the incidence of polio in the vaccinated areas. She guardedly concluded that the findings were reliable and that the Sabin vaccine was safe and effective. The United States and other countries then licensed it.         Dorothy Millicent Horstmann was born in Spokane, Wash., on July 2, 1911. She earned her undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley and her medical degree in 1940 from the University of California at San Francisco.         It was a time when doctors were first using sulfa drugs to cure pneumonia. Dr. Horstmann said that the combination of that drug advance, lectures by the renowned microbiologist Dr. Karl F. Meyer and her experience with patients during her internship and residency at San Francisco County Hospital piqued her interest in infectious diseases.         Dr. Horstmann spent an additional year training at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and, in 1942, she went to Yale to perform research under Dr. John R. Paul for a year before becoming a specialist in internal medicine. During a polio epidemic in New Haven in 1943, Dr. Horstmann pitched in. She joined the Yale poliomyelitis unit, and soon decided to devote her career to various aspects of infectious agents.         Dr. Horstmann became a pediatrician at midcareer. In 1961 she received her professorship at Yale, and in 1969 she became the first woman to receive an endowed chair there. It was in epidemiology and pediatrics and named for her mentor, Dr. Paul.         She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.         Dr. Horstmann is survived by a nephew, Paul Rooney, of Ashland, Ore.       
         Chrissie Collins, who with her husband devised and promoted what became the MedicAlert bracelet as a way to provide emergency medical information, died on Jan. 8 in Turlock, Calif. She was 94.         The concept of jewelry that could alert emergency personnel to allergies and other critical information, as well as provide a toll-free phone number for details, was born in a family emergency. In 1953, Mrs. Collins and her husband, Marion, were vacationing away from Turlock, in the Central Valley of California, when their daughter Linda, a high school sophomore, cut her finger while playing with an air rifle. She was taken to a hospital, where she had a violent reaction to a small amount of tetanus antitoxin and spent three days in an oxygen tent.         The situation was grave. Though she had received expert care from a doctor who was her uncle in an excellent hospital founded by her grandfather, she almost died because nobody knew about her allergy. Her father, a physician like his own father, sought to protect her afterward by pinning a piece of paper to her clothing saying, ''Fatally allergic to tetanus antitoxin.''         As Linda approached college, she tired of the safety pins and hotly rejected her father's suggestion that a tattoo might fit the bill.         ''She said, 'Dad, why don't you fix me some sort of bracelet?' '' Mrs. Collins said in an interview with The Los Angeles Daily News in 1998.         Dr. Collins designed the first bracelet, using the well-known medical symbol of the caduceus, two snakes wrapped around a winged staff. He placed the words ''Medic Alert'' alongside the emblem and listed his daughter's medical condition on the back.         A local jeweler fabricated that bracelet, which is now in the National Museum of Natural History's Science, Medicine and Society Collection, although it is not currently on display. The museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution.         ''Other people saw it and said, 'I ought to have one of those. I am allergic,' or 'I have a daughter with diabetes,' '' Linda told The Los Angeles Times in 1978. ''We began having them made up, one at a time.''         The family mailed literature about the bracelet to hospitals and law enforcement agencies throughout the United States and Canada. Some suggested adding a method to obtain additional information.         So the family developed a system by which emergency personnel could telephone 24 hours a day to get information. The first switchboard was that of the hospital where Linda had been taken for her injury.         Ever more volunteers came forward. In 1956, the MedicAlert Foundation was formed.         Things really took off after June 6, 1960, when This Week magazine, which appeared every Sunday in 40 large newspapers, published an article on MedicAlert. Within days, there were 100,000 orders for bracelets. Mrs. Collins remembered ''the whole town of Turlock'' working out of her family room to enroll new members and ship bracelets.         Tanya J. Glazebrook, president and chief executive of the foundation, said that MedicAlert had grown to more than four million bracelet-wearing members and that at least 80,000 lives were believed to have been saved by its efforts. People pay $35 to join and a $15 annual fee.         Chrissie Woolcock was born on July 30, 1906, in Douglas on the Isle of Mann in the British Isles. In 1912, she and her family immigrated to Turlock, where she attended local schools. She graduated from the University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif.         She thought briefly about moving to San Francisco. ''But then, I thought, I couldn't go to the opera or a play every night and I'd get tired of shopping,'' she said in an interview with The Modesto Bee in 1996. ''I thought my friends are more important, and I've always been glad that I stayed.''         In 1928, she married Marion Carter Collins, whom she had met in the eighth grade. She was the Turlock High School adult education choral director and later became involved in the Boy and Girl Scouts and local organizations and charities.         Her husband died in 1977. She is survived by her daughters, Margaret Gilbert of South Beach, Ore., and Linda Maurer of Turlock; her sons, Michael of Denton, Tex., and Thomas of Plattsville, Wis.; eight grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.         Ms. Glazebrook said Mrs. Collins was a MedicAlert board member almost until her death. She asked pointed questions about operations and was particularly fascinated by the foundation's huge computer operation. For her 90th birthday, she was given her own personal computer, and she frequently sent e-mail.       
         Kate Born Schaeffer, a longtime partner with her husband at Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan, which became known for selling art by old masters to museums and collectors, died on Dec. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 102.         For three decades Mrs. Schaeffer and her husband, Dr. Hanns Schaeffer, ran the New York Schaeffer Galleries, which was founded in 1936 and has been at 983 Park Avenue in Manhattan for more than 50 years. They also contributed some artworks to museums.         Dr. Schaeffer died in the early 1960's and Mrs. Schaeffer became the owner and president of Schaeffer Galleries until her death. Schaeffer Galleries is now owned and directed by the Schaeffers' daughter, Cornelia Bessie, who had been its vice president.         James J. Rorimer, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1955 to 1967, observed in 1961: ''The Schaeffers are among the most serious, knowledgeable and helpful art dealers who are enabling American museums to grow for the benefit of our public. They are friends who share unstintingly in helping curators, directors and trustees to choose with care the works of art which redound to the credit of their museums.''         The paintings and drawings that passed through the Schaeffers' hands included, among many others, Botticelli's ''Madonna and Child with Singing Angels,'' now held by the Staatliche Museen in Berlin; a Cranach in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo.; Correggio's ''Salvator Mundi'' in the National Gallery of Art in Washington; Rubens's ''Cleopatra'' at the Detroit Institute of Arts; a Frans Hals at the Mauritshuis in The Hague; numerous Rembrandts, including ''Young Man With a Sword'' in the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh; and da Vinci's ''Bear Walking'' and a Jean-Antoine Watteau, both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Gilbert S. Edelson, the administrative vice president of the Art Dealers Association of America, which is based in Manhattan, said the Schaeffers ''were knowledgeable, they were articulate, they had all the qualities that make truly distinguished dealers.''         Mrs. Schaeffer, whose maiden name was Born, was born in Germany and studied singing in various European capitals. She was a lieder and opera singer in Germany for a few years before she married Dr. Schaeffer, who was also born in Germany, not long after World War I ended. Later, gallery work became her main activity.         Her husband opened an art gallery in 1921 in Berlin and later operated galleries in London and San Francisco. Those galleries were also each named Schaeffer Galleries. All had closed before Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan was founded, after the Schaeffers had moved to the United States permanently.         Mrs. Schaeffer is survived by her daughter, Cornelia Bessie of Lyme, Conn.       
         Dr. Alexandra Adler, a New York neurologist and psychiatrist who carried on the tradition of her father, Alfred Adler, one of the pioneers of psychoanalytic theory, died Jan. 4 at New York University Hospital. She was 99 and lived in Manhattan.         A native of Vienna, she was among the earliest women to practice as a neurologist there and then in the United States. Her work on brain damage and alexia, the loss of the ability to read because of brain lesions, was often cited by others in the field.         She also wrote papers on psychological subjects ranging from alcoholism to juvenile delinquency. She was among the first to write detailed papers on post-traumatic stress syndrome, reflecting her studies of the surviving victims of the Coconut Grove nightclub fire in Boston in 1942, one of the nation's worst fire disasters.         Besides killing more than 490 people, the blaze left others with permanent brain damage. Dr. Adler studied the anxiety and depression that can follow such catastrophes and later applied her findings to the treatment World War II veterans.         Dr. Adler interpreted Adlerian theories in a book first published in 1938, ''Guiding Human Misfits: A Practical Application of Individual Psychology.'' It went through several editions in the United States and was republished in Germany in 1990.         Dr. Adler received her medical degree in Vienna, where she trained and practiced at the neuropsychiatric clinic of the University of Vienna. At the time, she also started editing the International Journal of Individual Psychology, the branch of psychology her father pioneered after he broke with Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytical emphasis on sex as the root of neurosis.         She came to this country in 1935 to teach and practice at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She joined the N.Y.U. faculty in 1946 and became a full professor of psychiatry at the its medical school in 1969.         An expert in schizophrenia, she worked at the New York City Department of Correction for 20 years with female offenders and was medical director of the Alfred Adler Mental Hygiene Clinic in Manhattan. She continued to see some patients at her private practice until a few years ago.         She contributed entries to national and international reference works.         In 1959, Dr. Adler married Dr. Halfdan Gregersen, a former dean and professor of Romance languages at Williams College. He died in 1980, and there are no immediate survivors.       
         Arlene Eisenberg, who with her two daughters wrote ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' which became known as the pregnancy bible, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         From girlhood, when she repeatedly read Dr. Benjamin Spock's ''Baby and Child Care'' to qualify for a Girl Scout child care merit badge, to grandmotherhood, when she led the weekly new mothers' group at Ansche Chesed Temple on the Upper West Side, she seemed the perfect mother, but her mission was to tell mothers that they did not have to be perfect.         ''She was my mother, but I lent her out a lot,'' said her daughter Heidi E. Murkoff. ''She was sort of foster mother to the world.''         ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' the team's first book in a best-selling series on what to expect from pregnancy, babies and toddlers, was released by the Workman Publishing Company in 1984. Sales were modest at first, but it inexorably climbed to the best-seller list six years later. Without extensive advertising, demand grew by what the authors called ''word of mother,'' with sales now totaling 9.6 million copies in 31 languages.         ''It was quietly marvelous, sort of like Mozart,'' said Peter Workman,  the publishing house president, of the book's success.         In 1999, Good Housekeeping magazine reported that a survey showed that 93 percent of expectant or nursing mothers who had read any book about pregnancy had read it.         Now as common as bibs at baby showers, the book provided common-sense answers to the questions of mothers-to-be. Topics range from diet to delivery to postpartum depression and are arranged by month of pregnancy.         The authors used a question-and-answer format to deal with things people might be shy about asking their doctor, like whether the fetus is aware that the parents are having sex. (No.)         Mrs. Eisenberg said the book responded to a fragmented society in which people often live far from relatives who could reassure them about pregnancy.         ''It used to be you could get all the good information about raising your kids from your mother,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1999. ''But it's all changed. Most young women have never held, never even see, a newborn baby. It's really a shock.''         The first ''what to expect'' book emerged from the 1984 pregnancy of Mrs. Murkoff, Mrs. Eisenberg's younger daughter and a writer who was dismayed that she could find few books about pregnancy that were not excessively didactic and authoritarian -- not to mention full of incomprehensible medical terms. The mother and daughter and another daughter, Sandee E. Hathaway, a nurse, teamed up to fill the void.         They delivered their book proposal to the publisher hours before Mrs. Murkoff gave birth to a daughter, Emma. They delivered the book the day Mrs. Hathaway felt the first kick from the fetus that was to be her daughter Rachel.         The success of the first book led the three to answer readers' pleas for help after birth. In 1989, they published ''What to Expect the First Year,'' and in 1994, ''What to Expect the Toddler Years.'' They also published ''What to Eat When You're Expecting,'' in 1986, and ''The Pregnancy Organizer,'' in 1996. All were published by Workman.         Arlene Leila Scharaga was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on June 8, 1934. Her father, Harry Scharaga, headed the Sanitation Department in Queens.         When Arlene was 16, her mother took her to an Eddie Fisher concert at the Paramount Theater. Afterward, they met Mr. Fisher and his young press agent, Howard Eisenberg. Before long, she volunteered to help organize fan clubs for the singer, personally visiting his barber to retrieve locks of the star's hair to send to bobbysoxers around the country.         When there wasn't enough of Mr. Fisher's hair to go around, she would send locks of Mr. Eisenberg's, Mr. Eisenberg said. He began to suspect she was most interested in being around him.         A couple of years later, she said, ''I'm going to be 18 and I don't want to waste any time.''         Mr. Eisenberg asked her to marry him. ''She ran after me until I caught her,'' he said.         She dropped out of Queens College for marriage, but her ambitions and abilities transcended babies. Mr. Eisenberg recounted how he had writer's block on a freelance article for a Sunday supplement that appeared in many newspapers. The day before it was due, Mrs. Eisenberg sat at the typewriter and wrote the entire piece, which with a few revisions, was accepted.         The two wrote articles together for many popular magazines, including The Ladies' Home Journal, McCall's and Sports Illustrated. In 1965, they won the Gold Medal of the National Conference of Christians and Jews for a Look magazine piece, ''The Christian War Against Anti-Semitism.''         The family lived in Garden City on Long Island and in Spring Valley in Rockland County, N.Y., before moving to Manhattan 19 years ago.         When the daughters became adults, the women often collaborated long distance, with various drafts and rewrites conveyed by fax or computer.         Mrs. Eisenberg did not need a guidebook to be a different kind of mother. At a time when breast-feeding was out of favor, she did it with her daughters and a son, Evan. She also insisted on wheat germ and dark bread, prompting her children to envy schoolmates eating white bread in the lunchroom.         In addition to her husband and her son (also a writer), both of Manhattan; Mrs. Hathaway, of Newton, Mass.; and Mrs. Murkoff, of Santa Barbara, Calif., Mrs. Eisenberg is survived by her mother, Mildred Scharaga of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Victor Scharaga of Washington; and six grandchildren.         Another of Mrs. Eisenberg's legacies is the What to Expect Foundation, which she and Mrs. Murkoff founded after visiting pregnant inmates at Rikers Island, the New York City jail. The foundation is printing a basic pregnancy book written at a lower literacy level for disadvantaged women.         Mrs. Murkoff says she will probably carry on with the next chapter, entirely predictable, in the family's series: ''What to Expect in the Teen Years.'' Emma, whose imminent birth inspired the first book, is 17.       
         Eleanor Lawrence, a flutist who played frequently in chamber music performances and with several orchestras in New York and who is credited with transforming a newsletter into an important resource for flutists, died on Jan. 16 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was brain cancer, said Nancy Toff, a flute historian and a former president of the National Flute Association.         Ms. Lawrence, who was also known by her married name, Eleanor Steindler, was born in Boston and grew up in Athens, Ohio, where her father, John C. Baker, was president of Ohio University. After completing her bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College, she studied the flute at the New England Conservatory with James Pappoutsakis, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She later studied with the flutist Marcel Moyse as well as with William Kincaid, the principal flutist of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and Harold Bennett, the principal flutist of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra.         When Ms. Lawrence moved to New York in the 1960's, she joined the American Symphony Orchestra and the Brooklyn Philharmonic and performed periodically with the New York Philharmonic and at the Metropolitan Opera. She also toured the United States as a recitalist. In 1969 she founded the Monomoy Chamber Ensemble, which played an annual summer series at the Monomoy Theater in Chatham, Mass. In recent years the ensemble performed as Monomoy Music and presented an annual series at Weill Recital Hall.         Ms. Lawrence had a broad repertory that included Ernst von Dohnanyi's Aria for Flute and Piano and Passacaglia for Solo Flute, both composed for her, and works by Hindemith, which she recorded for the Musical Heritage Society. One of her last projects was a reissue of Moyse's recordings, produced with the flutist William Bennett.         In addition to performing, Ms. Lawrence was an influential teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, and in master classes.         She was the president of the New York Flute Club for three nonconsecutive terms from 1973 to 1989. She edited The National Flute Association Newsletter, now The Flutist Quarterly, from the mid-1970's to the early 80's and expanded it from a concise information sheet to a publication that regularly included interviews with important flutists.         She is survived by her husband, Frank Steindler; a daughter, Catherine Steindler; a son, Frederick Steindler; and two sisters, Elizabeth Baker and Anne Baker, all of New York.       
         Sonia Arova, a Bulgarian-born ballerina who became an international star and was an early partner of such great male dancers as Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev, died on Sunday in San Diego. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Ms. Arova was the ballerina with whom Nureyev danced the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux at his New York debut with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet on March 10, 1962, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She and Bruhn first met in the mid-1940's in the Metropolitan Ballet, a short-lived but artistically enterprising London troupe.         Nureyev, Bruhn, Ms. Arova and the American ballerina Rosella Hightower joined forces to present sensationally successful programs together in Paris in 1962. Later that year, she was again Nureyev's ballerina as guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.         A dancer of strong technique and dramatic projection, Ms. Arova was born Sonia Errio in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where she studied music as well as ballet, receiving her dance training at the school of the Sofia Opera Ballet. When her teachers recommended further study in Paris, she left Bulgaria at age 11 with her mother. Her father sold his stamp collection to pay for her Parisian classes.         With the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Arova's British piano teacher in Paris urged her to escape France. Disguised in male attire as the teacher's son, Ms. Arova was smuggled into England on a fishing boat in 1940. She never saw her father again but was eventually reunited with her mother and sister.         In England, she danced with International Ballet (1942), Ballet Rambert (1946) and, most notably, with Metropolitan Ballet (1947-48). Then she became a balletic globe-trotter.         Ms. Arova was first associated with Page in Paris in 1951 when she danced a leading role in ''Revenge,'' the popular choreographic adaptation of the opera ''Il Trovatore'' that Page created for Les Ballets des Champs Élysées. Later, she appeared with Page's own Chicago company.         She was guest artist with American Ballet Theater several times in the 1950's and 60's, dancing both classical and contemporary works. Reviewing her performance in 1956, John Martin of The New York Times said she had become ''a lovely and curiously individual dancer, especially where dramatic color and characterization are involved.''         She also danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, London Festival Ballet, the Komaki Ballet of Japan, the Australian Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington.         Ms. Arova became increasingly involved with company direction, often in association with Thor Sutowski, the American dancer and choreographer, whom she married in 1965. As director of the Norwegian National Ballet from 1966 to 1970, she introduced several ballets by George Balanchine into the repertory, produced the first complete Oslo versions of ''Swan Lake'' and ''La Sylphide'' and was knighted for her services by King Olaf V.         She became director of the San Diego Ballet in 1971. In 1977 she and Mr. Sutowski were named co-directors of the dance department at the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a state-run high school in Birmingham. Many dancers they trained joined the Birmingham-based Ballet South, which made its New York debut at Brooklyn College in 1996 with a ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski. Anna Kisselgoff of The Times praised it for allowing its young women to ''show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork'' and ''dance with a pure classical style.''         Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski returned to San Diego in 1997, where they taught for both the San Diego Ballet and the California Ballet.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ariane Sutowski of San Diego, and a sister, Jeanette Errio of Vence, France.       
         Gail Fisher, who won an Emmy Award in 1970 for her portrayal of Peggy Fair, secretary to the gumshoe played by Mike Connors on the CBS television series ''Mannix,'' died on Dec. 2 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 65.         The cause was kidney failure.         Ms. Fisher's role on ''Mannix'' was the high point of a career that arched from rural poverty in New Jersey to a home in Beverly Hills before descending into problems with drugs and sporadic acting jobs.         At the peak of her career, on ''Mannix,'' whose residuals helped support her later, Ms. Fisher was fiercely proud of her achievement.         ''Well, certain people who had no knowledge of blacks have maybe -- maybe -- learned something because of 'Mannix's' Peggy Fair,'' she said in a 1972 interview. ''Blacks were pretty much alien objects on TV as recently as 10 years ago, you know, and now we're people. I think maybe before it's all over, it's going to be all right, and I'm proud I'm a part of that.''         The series, one of the most violent and longest-running of its era, began  in September 1967 and continued until August 1975. After the first year, to counteract unimpressive ratings, ''Mannix'' was changed, and Peggy Fair, the widow of a police officer who had been a friend of Joe Mannix, was added to the cast.         ''It was really a revolution in casting, you know,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''It was understood by all of us who auditioned that the girl could be anything -- oriental, black, anything -- just a human being. I won.''         Ms. Fisher was also proud of another achievement. ''I was the first black female -- no, make that black, period -- to make a national TV commercial, on camera, with lines,'' she said, referring to a pitch for the detergent All in the early 1960's.         Her achievements bucked discouragement.         ''My friends and family thought I was crazy,'' she said. ''You know, 'But honey, there ain't any black actresses.' ''         But she was determined to be one. She was born in Orange, N.J., and grew up in Potters Crossing, a black section of Edison Township, N.J.         She was one of five children. Ms. Fisher described her mother, Ona, as ''a great lady who brought me up to know there's no such thing as 'I can't.' ''         Ms. Fisher was 2 when her father died. As a teenager she was a cheerleader and a beauty contest winner. She was Miss Transit and Miss Black New Jersey and Miss Press Photographer. She modeled occasionally,  worked in a factory and skipped meals to pay for acting lessons. She studied with Lee Strasberg and  joined what was then the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center, working with Elia Kazan and Herbert Blau. Mr. Blau cast her as a young firebrand in a 1965 production of ''Danton's Death.''         She took time out for marriage and motherhood and moved to the West Coast, where she had random jobs on minor shows until she auditioned for ''Mannix.''         She was married several times, most notably in 1964 to her personal manager, Joe Levy. The marriage produced two daughters before ending in divorce.         Ms. Fisher is survived by her daughters, Samara Maxe of San Diego and Jole Baerga of Hackensack, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Fisher of Randallstown, Md.; and a sister, Ona Gaither of Alexandria, Va.       
         Sylvia Lawry, whose brother's incurable multiple sclerosis prompted her to found national and international organizations to fight the disease, died on Saturday at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Roosevelt Island. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lawry founded both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the United States, in 1946, and the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, in 1967. She was also one of the leaders of the effort to establish the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, in 1950.         It all began with a classified advertisement in 1945 in which Ms. Lawry beseeched readers to write her of any cures for multiple sclerosis. Instead, she got more than 50 replies asking for the same thing. Her life's mission was the result.         Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. Its onslaught is signaled by sudden neurological symptoms, including loss of vision, paralysis, numbness and difficulties in walking, as nerves lose their sheathing and are unable to conduct signals.         Partly as a result of research financed by the societies started by Ms. Lawry, scientists now suspect that the disease may be caused by a viral infection on top of an inherited genetic susceptibility, though the specific triggering mechanism remains unknown.         The national society has also helped develop medicines to alleviate symptoms and prolong life expectancy, essentially offering a normal life span to many with multiple sclerosis. In 1890, when multiple sclerosis was treated with herbs and bed rest, life expectancy was five years.  But there is still no cure for the disease, which the society says strikes another adult each hour, leaving the most afflicted paralyzed.         ''Sylvia's uncompromising battle for more than a half century to solve the mystery of multiple sclerosis made her a hero to anyone touched by this devastating disease,'' said Richard Slifka, chairman of the society.         The national society credited her with the first use of the abbreviation M.S. for the disease. The Oxford English Dictionary cites as the first use of the term a 1955 article in Science News Letter discussing work by the society.         Sylvia Friedman was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1915. Her father manufactured Venetian blinds. She graduated from Hunter College in 1936 and went to work in the office of her father's attorney as a receptionist. She hoped to go to law school and took a job in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.         In 1944, she married Michael Lawry; they were divorced two years later. She used the last name Lawry for the rest of her life, though she married Stanley Englander, who was in the wholesale meat business, in 1957. He died in 1968.         When Ms. Lawry's brother, Bernard, was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1945, she and her sister Alice placed a classified advertisement in The New York Times: ''Multiple sclerosis. Will anyone recovered from it please communicate with patient. T272 Times.''         The sisters received 54 replies from people as desperate as they were. Most asked to be informed if the two heard anything promising.         ''I was looking for medical clues that might have helped my brother,'' Ms. Lawry said in an interview with The New York Post in 1959. ''But when the responses started to snowball and come from all over the country, I decided to give up the law and let my creative energies spill over into helping M.S. victims.''         Starting with family and friends, Ms. Lawry built a network. Her sister Alice helped. Her other sister, Lillian, and her husband, Stanley Wilson, founded one of the first local chapters, in the Bronx.         Ms. Lawry is survived by Lillian Wilson, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Englander of Manhattan, and Steven Englander of Montgomery, N.Y., and two grandchildren.         The fight against multiple sclerosis grew. A tiny office was found. The doctors whom Ms. Lawry first consulted about her brother became interested in the effort.         Dee Sammak, the accounts payable manager who has worked for the society since 1954, said she has stayed all these years because of the inspiration of Ms. Lawry. ''Don't forget,'' Ms. Sammak said, ''when she started the society, women were not doing these things -- to start a society in a man's world.''         On March 11, 1946, Ms. Lawry assembled 20 prominent research scientists to found the Association for Advancement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which was renamed the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1947. Its first research grant went toward studying the relationship between the body's immune system and the effects of multiple sclerosis on the central nervous system.         Though her brother's health progressively weakened until his death in 1973, the organization Ms. Lawry founded gathered momentum. In 1950, she teamed up with Senator Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, whose daughter had multiple sclerosis, to lobby Congress for what is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.         The law creating the institute passed on Aug. 15, 1950. At that time, total federal appropriations for research on multiple sclerosis were $14,000. They now total $100 million a year, the society said.         Ms. Lawry's political skills were evident throughout her career. A frequent tactic, she told CNN in 1995, was to lobby people who had relatives or acquaintances with the disease. She mentioned winning support from President John F. Kennedy, who had a cousin with the disease, and Grace Kelly, whose first fiancé had it.         The international organization was born after the national society realized it was giving almost one-third of its research grants to foreigners. There are now 38 societies around the world.         Ms. Lawry, who worked 12-hour days, said she would never retire until multiple sclerosis retired. The disease still affects 1 in 1,000 people in the United States.         ''There was a continuing pain in her heart, because what she really wanted to see was M.S. go the way of polio,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a society spokeswoman.       
         Constance Myers Anderson, a former head of both the New York City and national Young Women's Christian Association, died Jan. 31 at her retirement home in Kennett Square, Penn. Mrs. Anderson, a former resident of New York City and of Wilton, Conn., was 102.         Mrs. Anderson, a 1919 graduate of Vassar College, was a longtime volunteer worker. She was the chairwoman and board member of the New York City Y.W.C.A. She was also president of the national organization from 1946 to 1952 and afterward was an honorary board member. She was a lifelong member of its World Service Council.         She helped found the United Service Organizations and was a former board member of the United States Committee for Unicef. She also was a member of the Riverside Church Board of Deacons. Mrs. Anderson is survived by a daughter, Constance A. Tate of Wilton; three grandsons, and seven great-grandchildren. She was the widow of Dr. Arthur Forrest Anderson.       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Dale Evans, who won the hearts of millions of Americans as she rode alongside her husband, Roy Rogers, in western films and on ''The Roy Rogers Show'' in the early years of television, died yesterday at her home in Apple Valley, Calif., east of Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Evans had not been on a horse since childhood and her hopes for a Hollywood career were sputtering when she was cast opposite John Wayne in her first Western, ''In Old Oklahoma,'' in 1944. She went on to become an accomplished sound-stage equestrienne, playing opposite rugged, handsome and likable cowboys in dozens of Westerns before she met and married Rogers, the King of the Cowboys, and composed the couple's enduring theme song, ''Happy Trails to You.''         By the 1950's she was a fixture on the sagebrush-epic landscape of snarling men, delicate ladies and roaring oil gushers. And with the dawn of television, she became a fixture in the minds of millions of children who tuned in to ''The Roy Rogers Show'' and saw her moseying  along on her buckskin horse, Buttermilk, while Rogers rode his beloved golden palomino, Trigger, the Smartest Horse in the Movies.         Miss Evans's break had come years earlier, while she was working as a $12-a-week stenographer in Dallas. While she was transcribing a letter, her boss suggested that she appear on a radio program that the company was sponsoring . She did, and soon was singing on regional radio hookups. By 1940 she was the featured performer on a CBS radio network program, ''News and Rhythm,'' and was heard on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy program.         She was also appearing at the Gay Paree supper club in Chicago, where her showstopper was ''Will You Marry Me, Mr. Larramie?''         One night an agent offered not marriage but a screen test, opposite Bing Crosby in ''Holiday Inn.'' She did not get the part in the film, which also starred Fred Astaire and featured such Irving Berlin hits as ''White Christmas.'' But 20th Century-Fox signed her to a one-year contract.         She moved to Republic in 1943 and was cast opposite Wayne in ''In Old Oklahoma'' (it was later retitled ''The War of the Wildcats''), a romance about a swaggering, no-nonsense oil driller. The following year, she was cast in ''The Cowboy and the Señorita.''         The cowboy was Roy Rogers, a rugged, handsome and likable man but, by his own account, ''no great shakes'' as a talker.         Miss Evans was no señorita -- at the time, she was married to her second husband, Robert Dale Butts, a pianist. They divorced in 1945, and the following year, Rogers's wife died after giving birth to a son, Roy Rogers Jr.         Miss Evans and Rogers made eight films together in 1946, including ''My Pal Trigger.'' She admitted to having trouble with Trigger: she made the mistake of patting his neck.         ''He is a very highly cued horse,'' she said. ''He is cued to rear when you touch that spot on his neck. He stood straight up on his hind legs. I slipped off that dish I was sitting on, and fell flat on my -- I fell off in the dust.''         Her fans complained that Rogers seemed to care more about Trigger than he cared about her. ''How that spurious cowhand can be content to kiss a horse when he has Miss Evans on the lot every day I cannot imagine,'' Robert C. Ruark wrote in The World-Telegram in 1946, ''but the inflexible law of westerns is that the hero shall never smooch the heroine.''         Once, she said, he came close.  ''They were going to let Roy kiss me on the forehead'' in one film -- she said she could not remember which. The idea was to show that he was sorry for pushing her under a bed to keep her from getting hurt in a rough-and-tumble scene. ''But they had a conference and decided against it,'' she said. ''The kids, you know, so I never even got kissed on the forehead. I just get knocked under beds.''         Miss Evans wore outfits of fringes, satins and studs that were every bit as sartorially splendid as those sported by her husband. Thousands and thousands of red-blooded American girls wore Dale Evans outfits and cast-iron six shooters in their matching holster sets as a kind of proto-feminist reach for equality with their brothers.         Dale Evans -- born Frances Octavia Smith on Oct. 31, 1912, in Uvalde, Tex. -- once said that her favorite role was Toni Ames, a newspaperwoman in ''Don't Fence Me In,'' which was released in 1945. ''I like to be active in a role, and hate namby-pamby heroines,'' she said. ''Toni was a pleasant departure from the usual western role, in which the girl just stands around while men do violent and admirable things.''         Miss Evans appeared in the 1950's with the evangelist Billy Graham, and in the 1960's she joined a group of other actors in pressing for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools.         She also began writing inspirational books like ''Angel Unaware'' (Revell, 1953) the story of her daughter Robin, who was born in 1950 with Down syndrome and heart problems and died a few days before her second birthday. ''Angel Unaware'' sold 400,000 copies in two years; Miss Evans gave the profits to the National Association for Retarded Children.         Contrary to common practice at the time, when such children were institutionalized, and contrary to Hollywood myth making, in which fans were not to know that perfect couples sometimes had imperfect children, Miss Evans and Rogers had kept Robin, who was their first child, at home with the family.         It was a large family from the start. Rogers had been a widower with three children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, a son, Roy  Jr., and another daughter, Linda Lou, and Miss Evans had a son, Thomas Frederick Fox Jr., from an earlier marriage that she had entered into when she was 14. To help them overcome their grief over the death of Robin, the couple adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee.         On Aug. 17, 1964, Deborah Lee, then 12 years old, was killed in a church bus-car collision near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David (Sandy) Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after one of their many goodwill visits to an orphanage, choked to death in a military hospital in Germany. An 18-year-old Army private, he had complained of feeling ill after dining at an enlisted men's club. After he died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ''Salute to Sandy.''         They also raised a foster child from Scotland, Marion Fleming, and a Choctaw Indian child, Mary Little Doe, called Dodie.         Roy Rogers died in 1998 at age 86.         Roy Rogers Jr. runs the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum in Victorville, Calif., at the edge of the Mojave Desert and seven miles from the Rogers-Evans ranch, named the Double-R Bar Ranch like the one in their television series.         There, amid all the memorabilia of a time in America when the good guys were polite singing cowboys who wore white hats and fought fairly and never cussed, is a glass case holding a stuffed Trigger, together with Miss Evans's horse Buttermilk and the couple's German shepherd, Bullet.         At the peak of their popularity in the late 1940's and early 50's, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had more than 2,000 fan clubs around the world and hundreds of licensed products from lunchboxes to comic books bore their names and faces.         Their rodeo set a box-office record at Madison Square Garden and they were the only couple to be chosen grand marshals of the annual Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif.         Miss Evans had almost as many credits for songwriting as she did for acting. She wrote or composed more than 25 songs, including ''Aha, San Antone,'' which sold more than 200,000 copies, and ''The Bible Tells Me So.'' She made 30 children's records, . including one that featured her own songs, ''Happy Birthday, Gentle Savior.''         ''I would love to be an evangelist,'' Miss Evans said, ''but I think God has revealed to me that I can serve him best by just remaining at my post.''         Correction:  February 10, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the film and television star Dale Evans on Thursday  misstated the name of the Chicago supper club where she performed in the early 1940's. It was Chez Paree, not Gay Paree.       
         Peggy Converse, a character actress whose seven-decade career in show business included films, television and more than 100 roles in more than 1,000 theaters, died on March 2 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 95.         Ms. Converse said she had appeared on stages in every major city in the United States and Canada and ''in most of the towns in between, any town that had a stage and would have me.''         She made the comment at 85 when she was paid for what became her final performance, a recorded scream that she said she had actually emitted for the 1958 low-budget thriller ''The Thing That Couldn't Die'' and that caught the ear of the producers of a new horror film.         ''The producers could not find anyone to scream the way they wanted, so they went back to the dark ages of film and heard mine,'' she said. ''You would have screamed that way, too, if you were in movies like that.''         Anyway, on the basis of hearing the recorded scream, the new producers decided, ''She's the one.''         Then they found out that Ms. Converse was 85. ''They, of course, realized they couldn't use me, so they used my voice,'' she said.         Besides screaming, Ms. Converse applied her talents to portraying leading ladies, ingénues, mothers, sisters and villains.         Her film career included roles in everything from ''Father Is a Bachelor'' (1950), with William Holden, and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), with Rita Hayworth, to ''The Accidental Tourist'' (1988), with Geena Davis and William Hurt.         Active in television from its infancy, Ms. Converse appeared in numerous episodes of ''Perry Mason'' with Raymond Burr, and on soap operas like ''The Young and the Restless,'' ''General Hospital'' and ''Days of Our Lives.''         Born in Oregon City, Ore., she began her career at 16, appearing as multiple characters in the ''Pilgrimage Play'' in Los Angeles. A 1927 graduate of Stanford University, she was a sought-after ingénue in the 1920's and 30's, appearing in Broadway productions like ''Infernal Machine,'' with Lloyd Bridges, and ''Comedy of Good and Evil,'' with Mildred Dunnock.         Ms. Converse played feature roles in plays like ''Othello,'' ''Wuthering Heights,'' ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' in summer stock companies from Tarrytown, N.Y., and Weston, Conn., to Santa Fe, N.M., and Carmel, Calif. She and her husband, the actor Don Porter, appeared together in the national touring companies of ''Any Wednesday,'' ''The Best Man'' and ''Love and Kisses.''         Her first marriage, to Edmund Converse, founder of Bonanza Airlines, ended in divorce.         She and Mr. Porter, whom she met at a cast party at the Carmel Playhouse, were married for 53 years. He died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter, the actress and singer Melissa Converse, and a son, Don Porter Jr., both of Los Angeles; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Wendy Carol Roth, whose disappointment that she could marvel at the Grand Canyon only from a parking lot led to a book to help other disabled people enjoy the national parks and a campaign for easier access to them, died on Wednesday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif.         Ms. Roth, a television producer, contracted multiple sclerosis 30 years ago and died of complications of the disease, her husband, Michael Tompane, said. She was 48.         For her book, ''Easy Access to National Parks: The Sierra Club Guide for People With Disabilities'' (Sierra Club, 1992), Ms. Roth and her husband drove 32,000 miles and visited 41 states to examine 37 national parks, as well as national historical parks, national monuments and national parkways. She got around on an electric three-wheel scooter, which she first controlled by hand and later, as her condition worsened, with her chin.         The book offered practical advice to make visiting the parks as pleasant as possible for disabled people -- advice that Ms. Roth and Mr. Tompane pointed out was also relevant to older people and for parents visiting with children.         In their travels, the couple found that some of the most popular national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and the Grand Canyon, had limited access for disabled people, while some they had imagined would not be particularly accessible, like Big Bend National Park in Texas, could accommodate the disabled.         After writing their book, they worked with the National Park Foundation to improve accessibility at 175 places in more than 100 national parks. Their organization, Easy Access Parks Challenge, organized volunteers and raised money. In one of its projects, television screens were installed at the base of Alcatraz so that visitors could see the cell block without having to climb a steep quarter-mile path.         Ms. Roth was born on Oct. 17, 1952, in Brooklyn, and grew up in East Norwich on Long Island. She graduated from Princeton and earned a master's degree in communications from Stanford.         As a television producer, she worked with Phil Donahue on several programs and developed, wrote and produced ''The Human Animal,'' a five-part series on human behavior first broadcast by NBC in 1986.         She is survived by her husband; her mother, Phyllis Feigenbaum of East Norwich; and her brother, Richard Roth of Seattle.         Last year, the National Multiple Sclerosis society presented Ms. Roth with its National Education Award. In her acceptance remarks, which were delivered by Mr. Donahue because she was ill, she said, ''If you do not give up, you will take your soul to the place you want to be.''       
         Debra E. Bernhardt, a labor historian who spearheaded a successful three-year drive to obtain landmark status for Union Square Park in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said her sister, Andra Bernhardt Ladd.         The head of the Tamiment Library and the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University, Dr. Bernhardt devoted her career to documenting the lives of the largely unsung men and women who built New York City and, day in and day out, nudged it along: sandhogs and seamstresses, pipe fitters and child welfare workers, secretaries and short-order cooks.         She was the author, with Rachel Bernstein, of ''Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives'' (New York University Press, 2000), a book of photographs and oral histories of working New Yorkers that grew out of an exhibition of the same name at the Museum of the City of New York.         At her death, Dr. Bernhardt was at work on Labor Arts, a Web site devoted to the art and artifacts of working people, scheduled to make its debut in May.         As a public historian, Dr. Bernhardt immersed herself in the kinds of workaday narratives that traditional academic historians, with their eyes trained on the powerful, often overlook. She described her work as ''documenting the undocumented,'' a phrase that neatly encapsulated the particular challenge of public history: how to chronicle the lives of people not in the habit of generating collections of personal papers, boxed and ready for posterity.         But what these people did have was stuff -- leaflets, lapel buttons, picket signs and photographs -- and part of Dr. Bernhardt's job was to persuade them that each of these dusty artifacts was a window on a bygone union election, organizing drive or strike; she would acquire many of them for the Tamiment Library, a research collection devoted to radical movements in the United States from the Civil War onward, as well as for the Wagner Archives, dedicated to labor studies.         ''The dustbin of history is lighter because of her,'' said Miriam Frank, a colleague at N.Y.U.         Debra Ellen Bernhardt was born on May 9, 1953, in Nuremberg, West Germany, where her parents were civilian employees of the United States Army; she was raised in Iron River, Mich., where several members of her Danish-American family worked in the iron mines. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, a master's from Wayne State University and, in 1988, one of the first doctorates from N.Y.U. in public history.         In conjunction with her dissertation, she produced ''New Yorkers at Work,'' an eight-part series broadcast on National Public Radio. In 1995, Dr. Bernhardt received the John Commerford Award, the highest honor of the New York Labor History Association, and, this year, the Distinguished Service Award from the New York City Central Labor Council.         Dr. Bernhardt is survived by her sister, of Lafayette, La.; her parents, Harold and Marcia Bernhardt, of Iron River; and by her husband, Jonathan Bloom, and her children, Alexander and Sonia, all of Brooklyn.         Despite her professional prominence, Dr. Bernhardt remained intensely proud of her own working-class roots. She sang in the New York City Labor Chorus; her business cards bore the logo of the union shop that printed them, as did her son's bar mitzvah invitations. She was known to her friends as Debs -- shorthand not only for Debra, but also for Eugene V.         And it was largely as a result of Dr. Bernhardt's efforts that in September 1998, Union Square Park was declared a national historic landmark by the National Park Service. The square was the cradle of American labor history -- a perennial home to anarchists, Communists, socialists, unionists and assorted rabble-rousing orators, and the site, in 1882, of what was later recognized as the first Labor Day parade.         ''No one realizes that the eight-hour day was won by working people on these streets, in this park,'' Dr. Bernhardt told The New York Times in 1998, as she sat in Union Square, once ringed by union halls and threadbare left-wing publishers and now by upscale restaurants and chain retailers. ''We wanted to celebrate the fact that ordinary people were able to express their rights to free speech and assembly on this spot.''       
         Toby Wing, whose pert good looks and vivacious personality made her a cinematic bombshell of the 30's -- as well as the heroine in a storybook romance with a celebrated aviator, Dick Merrill -- died on Friday at her home in Mathews, Va. She was 85.         ''Miss Wing is a nice girl with a face like the morning sun,'' The New York World Telegram proclaimed in 1937.         Starting in 1931, when she was 16, she made 38 movies in little more than a decade, becoming America's favorite pinup from Jean Harlow's death in 1937 until Betty Grable led G.I.'s to World War II in a swimsuit.         Miss Wing, her platinum hair shining brilliantly, was the original Goldwyn Girl, the first of Samuel Goldwyn's one-to-a-picture sex symbols, appearing in ''Palmy Days'' in 1932. She also appeared in Busby Berkeley's lavish musicals and in no time was getting roles requiring no small dash of sexual innuendo.         In the 1937 film ''True Confession,'' she was a secretary being interrogated by a lawyer, played by Fred MacMurray. The lawyer asks her to take shorthand, perhaps to see if she can or, more likely, to prove a point. Miss Wing stares back and says, ''Are you kidding?''         At the time, Paramount said she was receiving more fan mail than either Marlene Dietrich or Claudette Colbert, and she had carved out a highly visible niche.         ''She was a sex symbol, let's face it,'' said her nephew William H. Perry Jr.         But almost as suddenly as the shooting star flew, it crashed to earth. In 1940, the baby she had with Mr. Merrill died in his crib, and the couple moved to Florida to raise their second son in privacy. She made only one more film, ''The Marines Come Through,'' in 1943.         Some of her work was uncredited, and not a few of her parts were small, but she left behind moments that are treasured by film enthusiasts. It was to her, wearing a white fox bra above a bare midriff, that Dick Powell in sang ''Young and Healthy'' in the original ''42nd Street,'' in 1933.         Her publicity pictures were an industry in themselves. She posed, in succession, with at least five fiancés. She balanced on pyramids of rubber balls, and in one particularly inspired moment she was pictured saving a co-star from imminent death by drowning.         Once, she visited West Point, where she promised a cadet a signed photograph in return for a pair of cadet pajamas.         The pajamas arrived, and according to The Daily News, they were made of Mandarin silk with hand-embroidered flowers. Whether she reciprocated with a picture seems to have gone unreported.         She dated, or at least was said by the movie magazines to date, Maurice Chevalier, Alfred Vanderbilt and Franklin Roosevelt Jr. But it was her romance with Henry Tindall Merrill, known as Dick, that captured the national imagination. Mr. Merrill was the first aviator to fly a trans-Atlantic round trip and established such a record of safety on the La Guardia-to-Miami route for Eastern Airlines that be became known as New York's favorite pilot.         Not to say that Mr. Merrill was the first aviator to whom she was publicly linked. The New York American in 1936 told of her sorrow at the death of an army aviator with whom she had ''an understanding'' that marriage was imminent. She said in the article that the actor Jackie Coogan, another boyfriend, had been furious that the aviator had given her his West Point ring.         The next year, she told The Daily News that she was done with men. ''I have really given up falling in love with men!'' she said. ''Oh yes! My career is now to be my life.''         Six months later, The New York Herald Tribune carried a short item speculating that she was about to marry Mr. Merrill. The newspaper said she ''shook her blond tresses'' and said, ''You never can tell.'' They eloped to Tijuana 11 months later.         Martha Virginia Wing was born in Amelia Court House, Va., on July 14, 1915. Toby is an old family nickname.         She is survived by her sister, Patricia Gill of Gloucester, Va., and two granddaughters. Mr. Merrill and their second son, Richard, both died in 1982.       
         Margaret Tafoya, whose nimble, ingenious hands turned the chocolate-colored clay of her New Mexico pueblo into black-on-black and red-on-red pottery of such profound and graceful beauty that it acquired a global reputation, died on Feb. 25 at her home in Santa Clara Pueblo near Santa Fe. She was 96.         Her name in Tewa, the language of seven Southwestern pueblos, six in New Mexico and one in Arizona, was Corn Blossom. She was the matriarch of Santa Clara Pueblo potters, who are more numerous and produce more pottery than those of any other pueblo.         Her work, known for exceptionally large vessels, is exhibited in public and private collections around the world. She was named folk artist of the year by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984.         The art form she practiced has long been dominated by women, and Corn Blossom was the last of a group of women who attained fame through their mastery of it. Gone are Blue Corn and Maria Martinez of the San Ildefonso Pueblo, Christina Naranjo of Santa Clara and Grace Chapella, a Hopi.         Today Indian arts command astronomic prices and space on museum shelves in faraway cities, but fewer and fewer Pueblo Indians can speak or even understand Tewa. Mrs. Tafoya, though, was rooted in the old ways.         She spurned inventions like the potter's wheel. She kept chickens, milked her own cows, churned her own butter and rejected natural gas heat in favor of the traditional beehive fireplace.         After a brief fling with an Apache, she married a young man from the home pueblo, a distant relative with the same last name.         According to the Web site of the National Museum of American History (www.americanhistory.si.edu), Santa Clarans use the same word for clay and for people: nung.         Mrs. Tafoya always prayed to Mother Clay before working. ''You can't go to Mother Clay without the cornmeal and ask her permission to touch her,'' the museum Web site quotes Mrs. Tafoya as saying. ''Talk to Mother Clay.''         Though she was one of the last to make pots with handles and criticized others for adding semiprecious gems to pottery, she also liked to experiment.         She used different colors of slips, or thinned clays applied to the outside of her vessels, and her later forms were thinner, lighter and more graceful. Her shiny finishes became ever more polished. She even adapted Greek and Roman forms to classic Santa Clara shapes.         Mrs. Tafoya clearly loved her art, but it was also how she supported her 10 children who survived their first year; 2 others did not. As she said, ''I have dressed my children with clay.''         Maria Margarita Tafoya was born in her pueblo on Aug. 13, 1904. Her mother, Sara Fina Gutierrez Tafoya, or Autumn Leaf, was ''undoubtedly the outstanding Tewa potter of her time,'' Mary Ellen and Laurence Blair wrote in ''Margaret Tafoya: A Tewa Potter's Heritage and Legacy'' (Schiffer, 1986).         Her father, Geronimo, or White Flower, was mainly concerned with raising food for the family, but he was also the main marketer of his wife's pottery. He would load up his burros and make sales trips of up to 500 miles.         Five of the couple's eight children became excellent potters, driven and inspired by their perfectionist mother. Margaret's rigidly traditional approach was suggested by her insistence on using corn cobs, rather than sandpaper, for polishing.         She and her siblings made their first pottery when their mother tossed them pieces of clay. ''We get a piece of her clay and try to make animals or maybe bowls,'' Margaret said. ''We make these just for fun.''         Her mother allowed the young girl to sell her first piece of pottery to a Santa Fe dealer. ''I sure don't remember how much I got,'' she said in an interview in the book. ''It was a small piece, you know. It made me feel good. I felt I should make some more.''         Margaret attended the pueblo elementary school and went to Santa Fe Indian School.         She had to drop out of high school to help her family during the devastating flu epidemic of 1918. In 1924 she married Alcario Tafoya, a professional cook who was also related to famous potters. He carved decorations on Margaret's works but never signed them.         In the 1930's and 40's the Tafoyas often exchanged pottery for children's clothing. Mrs. Tafoya returned to work as soon as possible after the birth of each of her children.         At first she and her husband took her pottery to cities and fairs to sell. Then, tourists arrived in buses and cars to buy it directly. In the 1950's the family become friends with the owner of a resort at Royal Gorge on the front range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. He persuaded them to be resident Indians each summer. They would dance and sell pottery.         As the value of Indian art skyrocketed, such direct selling was no longer necessary. Dealers today place blind orders for anything they can get by the best-known potters. But Mrs. Tafoya enjoyed attending group shows simply to see what others were doing.         In 1977 she visited a gallery show in Santa Fe that included 51 potters from 11 tribes. Afterward she invited the great Hopi potter Grace Chapella, then 103, to her home. The two conversed in old Tewa, which is to today's Tewa what Elizabethan English is to modern English.         ''The Tafoya daughters were told that it was rude to interrupt with questions, so they missed much of the conversation,'' the Blairs said in their book.         Mrs. Tafoya once said that she learned to make pottery ''just by watching my Grandma,'' and most of her own children and grandchildren learned the same way.         She is survived by six daughters, Virginia Ebelacker, Jennie Trammel, Toni Roller, LuAnn Tafoya, Mary Esther Archuleta and Shirley Tafoya; three sons, Leonardo, Wayne and Phillip; 30 grandchildren; 45 great-grandchildren; and 11 great-great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Tafoya never used the words ''when I die,'' saying instead, ''if I die.''         And she does live, in clay and in blood. ''The children, I'm proud of them because they like to do this pottery,'' she said.       
         Dame Ninette de Valois, the founder of England's Royal Ballet and a major British choreographer, died yesterday at her home in London. She was 102.         With keen vision and unflagging energy, Dame Ninette guided one of the 20th century's greatest ballet companies.         It was under her directorship, from 1931 to 1963, that the troupe made its United States debut with Margot Fonteyn in 1949. As a choreographer, she experimented widely, yet regarded classical ballet as the basis for dance training. Her works often looked Expressionistic or grotesque, and she had dancers perform in bare feet as well as in toe shoes, but all were rooted in the academic ballet tradition and could be performed only by classical dancers.         Most of her best-known creations date from the 1930's. ''Job'' (1931) was inspired by William Blake's illustrations for the biblical story. ''Bar aux Folies-Bergère'' (1934) derived from the Manet painting of a Parisian nightspot. ''The Rake's Progress'' (1935) brought to life Hogarth's series of paintings showing a fashionable young man's decline into debauchery and madness. ''Checkmate'' (1937) was an allegorical chess game between love and death.         Despite her love of art as source material, Dame Ninette's ballets were more than living pictures. Theatrically vivid, they were also thoughtfully conceived. As early as 1928, Dancing Times, a British magazine, called her ''essentially a choreographer who thinks.''         When her death was announced by the Royal Ballet, Sir Anthony Dowell, the company's director, offered a tribute to Madam, as Dame Ninette was known to generations of dancers: ''Through her achievements she will remain a source of inspiration and encouragement as she has been throughout her life to so many of us as dancer, choreographer, director, teacher and mentor.''         The daughter of an English Army officer, she was born Edris Stannus in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1898; her family moved to England when she was 10. She once recalled that as a girl, she was reserved, obstinate and ''capable of the sulks.'' Later in life, a medical examination revealed that she had survived undetected childhood polio.         She enjoyed ballroom dance classes, and her mother, who invented Ninette de Valois as a stage name, considered her talented. At age 12, she was sent to the Lila Field Academy, a London theatrical school. She danced in London productions and studied with some of the major teachers of the day, including Edouard Espinosa, Nicholas Legat and Enrico Cecchetti. When almost every British seaside resort boasted  a theater, she toured the country until, as she later joked, she felt as if she had ''danced the 'Dying Swan' on every pier in England.''         In 1923 she joined Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, remaining with it for three years.         Returning to London in 1926, Miss de Valois opened a school and began to build what eventually became a national ballet company. She was soon involved with three important theater groups: the Old Vic in London, the Festival Theater in Cambridge and the Abbey Theater in Dublin. For them, she staged dances in plays, taught classes and presented dance programs. At the Abbey she worked with William Butler Yeats on some of his plays that combined poetry and dance.         On May 5, 1931, her dancers from the Old Vic offered their first full program, and a company was born. Called the Vic-Wells Ballet (after the jointly managed Old Vic theater and the Sadler's Wells, where the company originally performed), the troupe became the Sadler's Wells Ballet when all its performances were at that theater. It kept that name in 1946 when it moved to the Royal Opera House and in 1949 when it made its New York debut.         After the company settled into the Royal Opera House, Miss de Valois  established a second company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, at Sadler's Wells. This troupe was reorganized in several forms over the years and was the forerunner of today's Birmingham Royal Ballet, a major British company.         The original London company was renamed the Royal Ballet when it received a royal charter in 1956. Dame Ninette, who was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1951, remained its director only until 1963. Yet, for the rest of her life she helped guide the policies of the company and its affiliated school.         Although she choreographed less as her administrative duties increased, she remained an esteemed choreographer. She also offered directorial advice at the founding of the Turkish State Ballet in 1947 and choreographed for it on occasion until 1966.         She was considered a strict disciplinarian in the classroom, yet she was a witty conversationalist and, during her stage career, excelled in comic roles. Dame Ninette also wrote poetry, although she seldom published it. However, in 1985 the Sadler's Wells Trust issued ''The Cycle,'' a volume of her poetry, with all proceeds from its sale going to the Sadler's Wells Development Appeal.         As she became frail in later years, Dame Ninette spent most of her time at home. She was frequently visited by dance colleagues and her choreography was revived to the acclaim of new audiences. In 1993 there were two successful revivals: ''Checkmate,'' produced by the Royal Ballet, and a triumphant staging of ''Job'' by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, which was danced in theaters and in Coventry Cathedral. Dame Ninette attended the opening performance of ''Job'' when the Birmingham company had a season at Covent Garden that July, and she and her ballet received an ovation.         In 1998, to celebrate Dame Ninette's 100th birthday, the Royal Ballet offered ''The Rake's Progress'' as part of a gala program that included excerpts from some of her other works, and the Birmingham Ballet revived ''The Prospect Before Us'' (1940), a comedy about the rivalry between two 18th-century theater managers.         Dame Ninette always kept her private and public lives separate. In ''Come Dance With Me,'' an autobiography published in 1957, she noted that she was married in 1935, but not once in the book did she mention her husband's name: Dr. Arthur Connell, a physician who died in 1987. She left no survivors.         Dame Ninette was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1950, and received the Erasmus Prize (1974), the Society of West End Theaters' Special Award (1992), the Dance Magazine Award (1998) and honorary degrees from London (1947), Reading (1951), Oxford (1955), Aberdeen (1958) and Cambridge (1992) universities. In 1980 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Companions of Honor, for those who have done ''conspicuous national service.''       
         Ann Sothern, a deft comedian and talented singer who was known as the Queen of the B's at Columbia and RKO, where she made 18 movies between 1934 and 1936, died on Thursday at her home in Ketchum, Idaho. She was 92.         Perhaps never the star she might have been, Ms. Sothern was nevertheless one of the shrewdest actresses around. Her astuteness would eventually lead to her ownership of two early television series, ''Private Secretary'' and ''The Ann Sothern Show.''         In 1938 Ms. Sothern ditched her blond ingénue image and stormed Hollywood's greatest studio, MGM, only to be stuck in a wildly successful series of 10 movies about a tough, scatterbrained, down-on-her-luck Brooklyn chorus girl with a heart of gold, Maisie Ravier.         ''Maisie'' (1939), which had been bought for Jean Harlow and then shelved when Harlow died, was an instant phenomenon. Letters addressed to ''Maisie, U.S.A.'' had no trouble being delivered. After ''Congo Maisie'' (1940), ''Gold Rush Maisie'' (1940), ''Ringside Maisie'' (1941) and ''Maisie Was a Lady'' (1941) and between ''Swing Shift Maisie'' (1943) and ''Undercover Maisie'' (1947), Ms. Sothern begged the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, to allow her to quit the series. Mr. Mayer always answered: ''No. Your movies pay for our mistakes.''         Through bad luck or fate, Ms. Sothern was never more than a minor star: ''a Hollywood princess,'' she once said, ''not a Hollywood queen.''         Joseph Mankiewicz, the Academy Award-winning director who cast Ms. Sothern in her best role, as the soap opera-writing wife of Kirk Douglas in ''A Letter to Three Wives'' (1949), said of her: ''Poor Annie. Annie was a damned good Broadway musical comedy actress.  She had the sexiest mouth any woman ever had. But, at Metro, poor Annie got stuck in the Sam Katz unit.  She never got the big break Gene Kelly and others did, of being with the Arthur Freed steamroller of talent.''         Ms. Sothern got a few chances to show off her her talent, her timing and her figure in MGM musicals, most notably ''Lady Be Good'' (1941) and in the Ethel Merman role in the film version of the Cole Porter musical comedy ''Panama Hattie'' (1942). And she got good reviews as a hard-boiled ex-waitress pressed into service as a nurse and doomed when the island of Bataan was conquered by the Japanese in the World War II drama ''Cry Havoc'' (1943). But it would be 35 years after ''Cry Havoc'' before she earned her sole Academy Award nomination.         In 1988, at the age of 79, she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her performance as Lillian Gish's optimistic friend and neighbor in the 1987 drama of old age, ''The Whales of August.''         A few months before the nominations were announced, Ms. Sothern told an interviewer that her chances were dismal. ''I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,'' she said. ''Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all. I was too independent. How dare a woman be competitive or produce her own shows?''         Like her friend Lucille Ball, Ms. Sothern turned early to television. In  their B-movie days at RKO, the two actresses had cried on each other's  shoulders, with Ms. Sothern complaining that she got all the roles Katharine Hepburn did not want and Ms. Ball saying that she got all the parts Ms. Sothern did not want.         Ms. Sothern was savvy enough to produce ''Private Secretary,'' and to demand that the situation comedy be shot on film, to preserve it. As Susie McNamera, private secretary to a New York talent agent, Ms. Sothern became a heroine to secretaries all over America. The show alternated Sunday nights on CBS with ''The Jack Benny Show'' from February 1953 to September 1957.         When Ms. Sothern quarreled with the show's other producer over her right to take on movie roles, she left the series and sold her 104 episodes for well over $1 million. She immediately returned to CBS in ''The Ann Sothern Show'' as the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel.  Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, was a guest star on the first episode, and Ms. Sothern returned the favor several times as the Countess Framboise on ''I Love Lucy.'' In 1989, 28 years after ''The Ann Sothern Show'' went off the air, the actress sold the rights to the cable channel Nickelodeon, where the show became an unexpected hit.         Ann Sothern was born Harriette Lake on Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., where her mother, a concert singer, was on tour. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Walter and Annette Yde-Lake. Of Danish stock, she was raised in Minnesota by her mother and grandmother after her father, a meat salesman and womanizer, deserted the family when she was 5.         At 16 she was named the outstanding high school composer in Minnesota and sent to Detroit to represent Minnesota in a national contest. She spent a year at the University of Washington before joining her mother, who was a singing teacher in Hollywood. When half a dozen bit parts in movies got her nowhere, she tried Broadway with somewhat more success.         Florenz Ziegfeld offered her a part in ''Smiles'' with Marilyn Miller, but the star considered the 20-year-old Ms. Sothern too much competition and had her fired after the Boston tryout. In 1931 she played the ingenue in ''Everybody's Welcome,'' the play that introduced the song ''As Time Goes By''; she then toured for seven months in the George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind-Ira and George Gershwin musical ''Of Thee I Sing.''  After the tour ended she took over the same role on Broadway, replacing Lois Moran. And Hollywood noticed.         She was signed by Columbia Studios, which changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair color from red to platinum blond. From ''Let's Fall in Love'' in 1933 through ''The Hell Cat,'' ''Blind Date'' and ''Kid Millions'' with Eddie Cantor in 1934, the Maurice Chevalier musical ''Folies-Bergère'' in 1935 and a dozen more lightweight but pleasant musicals and comedies, she bubbled and sang.         Married to the bandleader Rogert Pryor and living in a huge rented house in Beverly Hills, she decided she had had enough of B movies. ''I found a much smaller house in Hollywood,'' she recalled. ''We lived cautiously, not as extravagantly, for a year. I was just so sick of those pictures, I decided I wasn't going to do them anymore.''         After making seven movies in 1937, she was off the screen until 1939, when she returned with fourth billing in an A movie, MGM's ''Trade Winds,'' as Fredric March's manipulative secretary. When he saw ''Trade Winds,'' Walter Ruben, the producer of ''Maisie,'' refused to cast one of MGM's contract actresses as Maisie; he insisted on Ann Sothern for the role that would define her career for the next decade.         In 1950, with her MGM contract coming to an end, she collapsed on the ski slopes at Sun Valley, Idaho, with a near-fatal case of hepatitis and was in and out of hospitals for a year. She had divorced Pryor in 1942. In 1943 she married the actor Robert Sterling and had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Her movie career was essentially over, too, although she had solid parts in Gore Vidal's satirical political drama, ''The Best Man,'' and the Olivia de Havilland thriller ''Lady in a Cage,'' both in 1964. In 1965 she played her most bizarre role, as the voice of the mother of Jerry Van Dyke reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile in the television series ''My Mother the Car.''         Like many former stars she turned eventually to summer stock and dinner theater, with disastrous results. In 1974 on a stage in Jacksonville, Fla., falling scenery broke her back and smashed the nerves in her legs. She finished the performance, held together with silver gaffer's tape.         Told she would probably never walk again, she refused to accept the diagnosis. Immensely athletic, she was a crack trap shooter and deep sea fisherman, and her MGM contract gave her three months off each winter to ski in Sun Valley. She never came to terms with what the accident had done to her body. But she did walk, with a cane that she used reluctantly and constantly misplaced. And, a decade after the accident, she moved out of Southern California to Ketchum, where she could see Dollar Mountain, which she used to ski, through the window of her house.         A different kind of accident brought her one more chance for glory. The producer of a television remake of ''A Letter to Three Wives'' thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars, Jeanne Crain or Ms. Sothern, to play a cameo role. Ms. Sothern's bit part let Lindsay Anderson, the director who would be making ''The Whales of August,'' know that Ms. Sothern was still alive.         Mr. Anderson had retained ''a memory of her charm'' from Ms. Sothern's early musicals. ''In a sense she was too good an actress to be a star,'' he said. ''Being a star requires elephantiasis of the ego.''         Ms. Sothern is survived by her  daughter, Tisha Sterling, an actress and designer; a sister, Sally Adams of Boise, Idaho; and a granddaughter.         Summing up her career after ''The Whales of August,'' Ms. Sothern shook her graying gold ringlets and said, ''I've done everything but play rodeos.''         Correction:  March 20, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the actress Ann Sothern on Saturday misidentified the distributor of ''Trade Winds,'' a 1938 film in which she played a supporting role. It was United Artists, not MGM.         Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the television show on which she appeared as the Countess Framboise. It was ''The Lucy Show,'' not ''I Love Lucy.''       
         Hollis Sigler, a Chicago-based artist whose autobiographical narrative paintings often focused on her long struggle with breast cancer, died of the disease on Thursday at her home in Prairie View, Ill. She was 53.         Ms. Sigler's early work was abstract expressionist, then photo-realist. But in 1976, trying to disengage from what she viewed as a male-dominated academic tradition, she shifted to a sweetly colored faux-naïve mode. The results were deeply personal depictions of domestic settings and suburban landscapes, with links to the art of Florine Stett heimer, 19th-century Hudson River School painting and Chicago's so-called Hairy Who school of cartoon- and folk-influenced work.         In 1985 Ms. Sigler's cancer was diagnosed, and she had a mastectomy and chemotherapy; the cancer recurred in 1989 and 1992, spreading to her bones.         ''I realized this was not something that was going to go away,'' she said in an interview in The New Art Examiner in 1994. ''I really do have to live with this disease, and probably die with this disease. With this in mind, I decided to change my work.''         Her paintings during the 1990's incorporated specific references to cancer in images of fragmented bodies and texts added to the works. A series of oil pastel paintings titled ''Breast Cancer Journal: Walking With the Ghosts of My Grandmothers'' (1992-1993) included historical information and statistical data on the disease, from which Ms. Sigler's mother and grandmother also suffered. The series was exhibited at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, and ''Hollis Sigler's Breast Cancer Journal,'' a book of related essays by Ms. Sigler, Susan M. Love and James Yood, was published by Hudson Hills Press in 1999.         Ms. Sigler, who was born in 1948 in Gary, Ind., attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and received an honorary doctorate from Moore College in 1994. She taught at Columbia College in Chicago for more than 20 years.         She was represented by Carl Hammer Gallery and Printworks Gallery in Chicago and Steven Scott Gallery in Baltimore and was a founding member of Artemisia in Chicago, one of the first women's cooperative galleries in the United States. She also showed with Barbara Gladstone Gallery in New York in the early 1980's.         This year she was awarded the College Art Association's Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement; she also received the Chicago Caucus for Women in the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award.         Ms. Sigler is survived by her companion, Patricia Locke of Highland Park, Ill.; her father, Philip Sigler of North Carolina; and a brother, Andrew Sigler of Chicago.       
         Beatrice Straight, a graceful and versatile actress who won both an Oscar and a Tony Award, died on Saturday in North Ridge, Calif. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif., for most of the last 10 years.         Because she came from a wealthy  family, the Whitneys (her mother was Dorothy Payne Whitney), she never had to act for a living but was dedicated to the art of theater. When she became successful, she continued to choose roles for their challenges rather than for their ability to further her career.         Onstage and in films, Ms. Straight projected an image that was dignified but with strong emotional undercurrents. She brought believability to whatever role she undertook, acting in classics as well as contemporary plays and movies.         In the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ''Crucible'' in 1953, she was the essence of Elizabeth Proctor. Reviewing the play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that both Ms. Straight and her co-star, Arthur Kennedy, were superb, adding that in performance, she was ''reserved, detached, above and beyond the contention.'' That role earned her a Tony as best supporting actress.         In 1977 she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her performance in Sidney Lumet's ''Network'' as the wife William Holden's character spurns. The role was brief but noticeable, behind the dramatic fireworks, a familiar place for Ms. Straight.         She had a variety of roles in plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen and Tennessee Williams. In 1982 she scored another film success in ''Poltergeist'' as a psychologist moonlighting as a parapsychologist.         Beatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, N.Y. Her father, Willard Dickerman Straight, was a banker and former official in the State Department. She attended the Lincoln School in New York and Dartington Hall Community in Devonshire, England, a school founded by her mother and stepfather, Leonard Elmhirst.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in ''Bitter Oleander.'' After she persuaded Michael Chekhov, Chekhov's nephew, to join her in forming an acting school and company, the Dartington Hall Players in England, they brought the troupe to the United States, where she performed in Shakespeare. Then she continued on Broadway as Olivia in ''Twelfth Night,'' Emily Dickinson in ''Eastward in Eden'' and Lady Macduff in ''Macbeth,'' with Michael Redgrave.         In 1948 she succeeded Wendy Hiller as Catherine Sloper in the Broadway production of ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square'' in which she played opposite Peter Cookson. After the run, she and Mr. Cookson married. It was a second marriage for both.         In 1950 Ms. Straight played the governess in ''The Innocents,'' an adaptation of James's ''Turn of the Screw'' produced by Mr. Cookson. In his Times review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Straight acted ''with force, sensitivity and old-fashioned charm, in a style that Henry James would have been compelled to applaud.''         She continued to act on and off Broadway, playing opposite Richard Kiley in Robert Ardrey's ''Sing Me No Lullabies'' and opposite Van Heflin in the Broadway version of Rod Serling's television play ''Patterns.'' She also had the title role in Racine's ''Phèdre.''         In 1967 she was in ''Everything in the Garden,'' Edward Albee's adaptation of a play by Giles Cooper. In 1973 she played Mrs. Alving in a Roundabout Theater production of Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and in 1979 was Gertrude to William Hurt's Hamlet at the Circle Repertory Company.         Among her many television appearances, she was Goneril to Orson Welles's King Lear in an abbreviated version of the play on ''Omnibus,'' and Rose Kennedy in ''Robert Kennedy and His Times.'' In 1986 she was in Mr. Lumet's film ''Power'' and in 1991 played Goldie Hawn's mother in ''Deceived.''         Throughout her life, Ms. Straight was also a producer and teacher. As a founder of Theater Incorporated, she was instrumental in bringing the Old Vic, with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, to the United States. In 1981 she helped revive Michael Chekhov's School of Theater in New York.         Ms. Straight's husband died in 1990. She is survived by her sons, Gary Cookson, an actor in New York, and Tony Cookson, a writer and director in Santa Monica, Calif.; two stepchildren, Peter Cookson Jr. of Irvington, N.Y., and Jane Coopland of Hawaii; a brother, Michael Straight of Chicago, a former deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Despite her patrician background, Ms. Straight always regarded herself as a working actress. ''I may have been born in society,'' she once said, ''but I was never part of anything but theater.''       
         Marjorie Hunter, a reporter for The New York Times who covered the White House and Congress at a time when most other women in Washington journalism were assigned to the activities of the first lady, died here today. She was 78.         The cause was acute leukemia.         Journalism was almost completely a male bastion here until Eleanor Roosevelt started holding press conferences every other Tuesday in the 1930's and decreed that only women could attend.         The Times at first resisted assigning a woman to its Washington bureau and instead sent a reporter from New York to the White House each time that Mrs. Roosevelt held a press conference.         In time, that reporter left the paper and Ms. Hunter -- Maggie to everyone from copy boys to presidents -- was hired in 1961 as her replacement.         But Ms. Hunter, who had covered the Legislature in North Carolina and had an affinity for politicians, soon tired of news of the first lady and persuaded her boss, James Reston, to assign her to cover Congress and other government news.         In ''The Girls in the Balcony,'' (Random House, 1992) Nan Robertson, a former reporter for The Times, wrote of the obstacles that women in Washington journalism faced in the 1960's. The balcony in the title referred to the perch above the auditorium of the National Press Club, which did not allow women on the floor and barred them from membership.         ''Maggie Hunter recalled the day she started a little mutiny at The New York Times bureau because of the balcony,'' Ms. Robertson wrote. ''Scotty Reston, then the bureau chief, had sent her off to the club to cover a speech by Madame Nhu, the beautiful and sinister female leader of South Vietnam, the wife of Ngo Dinh Nhu.         ''Now, Maggie, a Southern lady and a thorough professional, was no feminist firebrand. That day, however, 'I stood on a rolled-up carpet in the back of the balcony and I couldn't hear a goddamned word going on down there -- I couldn't hear a word.'         ''Afterwards, she marched, fuming into Reston's office. She blurted out, 'Scotty, don't you ever send me to that damned National Press Club ever again.'         ''Reston turned to Wallace Carroll, the bureau's news editor, who had befriended Maggie at The Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina and had brought her to The Times. 'Wally,' said Reston slowly, with an air of innocent wonderment, 'what's wrong with Maggie?'         '''I don't think,' she said years later, 'that Scotty ever understood why I was so mad.' ''         Ms. Hunter was born June 2, 1922, in Bethany, W.Va., and grew up on the campus of Elon College in North Carolina, where her father, Joshua A. Hunter, was a professor and her mother, Minna, taught in the local school system.         She was managing editor of the Elon College newspaper while a student and was also a correspondent for the local paper, The Burlington Times-News. She graduated from Elon in 1942 and then worked as a reporter for The Raleigh News and Observer, The Houston Press and The Winston-Salem Journal.         She retired from the Times in 1986.         Ms. Hunter is survived by a niece, Susie Frye of Hickory, N.C., and a nephew, Thomas Walker of Richmond, Va.         In 1969, Ms. Hunter was elected president of the Women's National Press Club. Its name was changed to the Washington Press Club when it started admitting men. The National Press Club finally admitted women in 1971 and the two clubs were merged in 1985.         Ms. Hunter was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations Hall of Fame in 1992. Her citation said:         ''A firm believer in the watchdog function of the press, Hunter gained notoriety for a 1955 incident in which she challenged the Appropriations Committee's right to convene in closed session and had to be carried from the room while still sitting in her chair.''       
         Kay Willis, who used the skills she honed as a mother of 10 to organize a national parents' support group and write a popular book on how to be a good parent, died on April 5 at a hospital in Montclair, N.J. She was 71 and lived in Rutherford, N.J.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Believing that the women's movement was overshadowing motherhood, Mrs. Willis and a few like-minded women formed Mothers Matter, an educational group, in Rutherford in 1975, in the home where she and her husband, Benedict, raised six daughters and four sons.         For the next 25 years she spread her gospel on the vital importance of healthy child-rearing to families and to the country. She lectured widely, conducted seminars, appeared on national television programs and served on industry advisory boards on toys and other products.         Most of her seminars were directed at mothers, usually 15 to 50 of them at a time. But she and her husband, Benedict P. Willis, also started a series of seminars for fathers, which she continued after his death.         Mrs. Willis, assisted by Maryann B. Brinley, published '''Are We Having Fun Yet? The Sixteen Secrets of Happy Parenting'' (Warner Books, 1998). It has been translated into six languages and remains in print in this country.         Catherine Rubacky Willis was born in Passaic, N.J. She attended Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia but left before graduation in 1950 to marry and start a family.         Her husband died in 1988. She is survived by their daughters, Jo-Ellen Willis-Rose of Little Rock, Ark.; Kim, of Boulder, Colo.; Patricia and Maureen, of Rutherford; Fran White of Dallas; and Jeanne, of Manhattan; their sons, Benedict 3rd, of Ramsey, N.J.; Timothy and Jerry, of Rutherford; and Dan, of East Rutherford; two brothers, Dr. Gerald Rubacky of Monclair, N.J., and Joseph Rubacky of Wyckoff; a sister, Ellen Tobin of Bay Head, N.J.; and 11 grandchildren.         Mrs. Willis regarded bringing up baby as the most important job anyone could have. One of her central messages was that in order to take good care of children, parents must take good care of themselves. Parenthood, she said, was to enjoy, not just to endure.         Of course there were practical considerations, too.         ''In my lifetime,'' she once said, ''the two biggest advances in raising children have been the clothes dryer and the disposable diaper.''       
         Frances Ann Cannon Dougherty, a theatrical producer, died on April 25 at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 82.         Ms. Dougherty began her career in the late 1950's with the Phoenix Theater. In 1961 she and another producer, Michael Dewell, founded the National Repertory Theater. The N.R.T.'s Broadway productions included ''The Crucible'' (1964), ''The Seagull'' (1964), ''Tonight at 8:30'' (1967) and ''The Imaginary Invalid'' (1967) and featured actors like Eva Le Gallienne, Farley Granger and Denholm Elliott. Its touring productions included ''Mary Stuart'' and ''The Trojan Women.'' The company received a Tony Award in 1965 for its work in producing classical theater.         In 1983 Ms. Dougherty was a co-founder with Anthony Stimac of the Musical Theater Works in Greenwich Village, a development center for new musicals. She also served as chairwoman of the John Drew Theater in East Hampton.         Ms. Dougherty's first marriage, to the writer John Hersey, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, Frazer; four children from her first marriage, Martin C. Hersey, John R. Hersey, Ann B. Hersey and Baird Hersey; four stepchildren, Frazer P. Dougherty, Rush H. Dougherty, Ariel M. Dougherty and Page D. Delano; and 14 grandchildren.       
         Ann Tanneyhill, a counselor who was the National Urban League's director of vocational services from 1947 to 1961, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Mashpee, Mass. She was 95.         For more than 40 years, beginning in 1930, she was on the headquarters staff of the league, a movement dedicated to helping African-Americans gain social and economic equality by finding better jobs and owning their own homes and businesses.         Ms. Tanneyhill had a leading part for decades in the league's efforts to increase job opportunities for black Americans. She led yearly campaigns to encourage black youngsters to get education and training.         Ms. Tanneyhill was born in Boston and held degrees from Simmons College and Columbia. Her immediate survivors are a niece, Lucy Tanneyhill Cromwell of Mashpee; and a nephew, William Grandison Tanneyhill of Harwich, Mass.       
         Dr. Rosa Susan Penelope Beddington, an experimental biologist whose research produced insights into the way an embryo becomes a fetus in mammals, died on May 18 in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, England. She was 45 and had formerly lived in Edinburgh and London.         The cause was cancer, according to British press reports.         Dr. Beddington, a skilled microsurgeon, was among the first women to be admitted to Brasenose College at Oxford to study medicine, and she soon made embryology her career. Most recently she headed the mammalian development section of the National Institute for Medical Research in London.         Her skill in working on the tiniest embryonic cell structures under the microscope advanced scientific understanding of mammalian development. Dr. Beddington observed how such a cell determines what to grow into and what governs the process that follows.         Dr. Beddington's survivors include her husband, the Rev. Robin A. Denniston.       
         Rita Hunter, the British soprano famed especially for her performances as Brünnhilde and Norma, died last Sunday in Sydney, Australia. She was 67.         Possessed of an immense voice, forthright and ringing, Ms. Hunter in her prime, which coincided roughly with the 1970's, seemed ready to take over from Birgit Nilsson as the world's leading Wagnerian soprano. In 1975, when the two singers appeared together at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Die Walküre,'' Ms. Hunter as Brünnhilde and Ms. Nilsson switching from that role to Sieglinde, it was as if the bequeathing -- or the challenge -- were being staged.         But the process stalled. When Ms. Hunter began to have difficulty controlling her voice, her gifts of native ability and robust good sense were insufficient.         Rita Nellie Hunter was born on Aug. 15, 1933, in Wallasey, England, where her father was a boilermaker. She had singing lessons with Olive Lloyd and Harry Burgon, and appeared in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' when she was 14. She also studied with Edwin Francis in Liverpool.         In 1954 she joined the chorus of the Sadler's Wells Opera, in London, and continued her training with Edward Renton. Three years later she joined the Carl Rosa Opera and married a colleague, the baritone John Darnley-Thomas. She found herself back in London when the Carl Rosa and Sadler's Wells companies merged in 1959, but before resuming her career, she won a scholarship that allowed her to study for six months with the great soprano Eva Turner.         After that she went to her husband's teacher, Redvers Llewellyn, and began to get important roles at Sadler's Wells, including Senta in ''The Flying Dutchman'' in 1964, her first Wagner. In 1968 she had a baby, but was soon preparing for the English National Opera's ''Ring,'' under the conductor Reginald Goodall.         That ''Ring,'' which began with ''Die Walküre'' in 1970 and was completed in 1973, was a triumph, thanks partly to Ms. Hunter's boldly sung and magnificent Brünnhilde. She went on to sing -- apart from her Met Brünnhilde in the spring of 1975 -- the title role in ''Norma'' in San Francisco in October that year and at the Met immediately after. Her other roles included Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' (New Orleans, 1978), Turandot (Welsh National Opera, 1979) and Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' (Welsh National Opera, 1980). She also repeated her Brünnhilde in the Seattle ''Ring'' of 1980.         She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1980.         In 1981 she signed a three-year contract with the Australian Opera, and sang Brünnhilde, Isolde, Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Aida, the ''Trovatore'' Leonora, Norma, and Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana.'' She elected to remain in Australia, and, though she did rather little stage work after 1985, was much in demand for concerts and recitals in Australia, Britain and the United States. Her autobiography, ''Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,'' came out in 1986.         Her husband died in 1994. She is survived by her daughter, Mairwyn.       
         Lillian R. Berkman, a pioneering businesswoman, a collector of Renaissance art and an arts patron involved with many of New York's cultural institutions, died on May 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was liver failure.         Ms. Berkman founded the American Tractor Corporation with her first husband, Marc. B. Rojtman, and became one of the first female executives in heavy-equipment manufacturing. She later served on the boards of many corporations, including Allied Stores Corporation and Sterling National Bank. Mr. Rojtman died in 1967.         She was a member of the dean's advisory board at the Harvard Law School, where she established, with her second husband, Jack N. Berkman, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, a research center on legal issues in the online era.         Her art collection included significant Italian Renaissance paintings as well as 18th- and 19th-century woodblock prints once owned by Frank Lloyd Wright. Among her cultural affiliations, she was a fellow at the Morgan Library, the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was an advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mr. Berkman died in 1995. She is survived by two brothers, William Dubois of Brookville, N.Y., and Harold Winters of Manhattan; a sister, Barbara Hagani of Kings Point, N.Y.; and three stepsons.       
         Lillemor Taylor Robb, chairwoman of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct from 1975 to 1989, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was in her 80's and lived in Slingerlands, N.Y.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Robb, a political independent who had had training to become a legal secretary, was married to Gene Robb, who was the publisher of Capital Newspapers, including The Times Union of Albany. He died in 1969.         She held posts in the nonprofit world before Gov. Malcolm Wilson appointed her to the Commission on Judicial Conduct when it was founded in 1974.         The panel was established by the State Legislature and Governor Wilson to uproot corrupt and abusive judges during a national movement for accountability from the bench. From 1961 to 1981, the 49 other states also set up judicial review groups.         Govs. Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo reappointed Mrs. Robb to the New York commission. Its other members elected her as chairwoman for seven successive two-year terms.         Lillemor Taylor Robb, known as Lee, was born in Stavanger, Norway, the daughter of the American consul general there. She grew up in Nebraska and graduated from the University of Nebraska.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria McGoldrick of Loudonville, N.Y.; Christina Robb of Sharon, Mass.; and Deborah Twombly of Cape Elizabeth, Me.; 11 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Anne Anastasi, whose influence is felt by every student who takes a psychology course and by anyone who fills in the answers on a standardized test intended to measure achievement, intelligence, aptitude, personality or creativity, died on May 4 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Dr. Anastasi, a former professor at Fordham University who remained professionally active until shortly before her death, was known as the ''test guru.''' Her 1954 text, ''Psychological Testing,'' is still required reading in undergraduate and graduate psychology courses and is considered a virtual bible for the field.         The book, an encyclopedic review of how tests are constructed, validated and interpreted, received wide acclaim for its lucidity and depth of analysis. It is in its seventh printing and has been translated into nine languages.         ''Every psychologist has heard of Anastasi,'' said Dr. Mary Procidano, chairwoman of the psychology department at Fordham. ''She really defined the field.''         Dr. Anastasi took a special interest in the question of whether tests could be created that were free of cultural bias, Dr. Procidano and other colleagues said. In the 1960's and 70's, While some in the field championed so-called ''culture fair'' tests, Dr. Anastasi argued that the claim that tests could be entirely unbiased was a fallacy.         In addition to her contributions to testing, Dr. Anastasi was renowned for her studies of individual and group differences and the interplay of biology and environment in shaping personality and intellectual development.         Dr. Robert Perloff, the distinguished service professor emeritus of psychology and business administration at the University of Pittsburgh, said that Dr. Anastasi, who wrote more than 150 scholarly books, monographs and articles, brought to the issue a balanced, deeply rational perspective and an insistence on solid science.         She also played a significant role, Dr. Perloff said, in applying psychology to real-world situations, both through areas like industrial psychology and consumer psychology and in the clinical consulting room.         ''Many academic psychologists would look down their noses at practitioners,'' Dr. Perloff said. ''She never did that.''         Born on Dec. 19, 1908, in Manhattan, Anne Anastasi was schooled at home until she was 9. Her mother was the office manager at Il Progresso, the Italian newspaper. Her father died when she was 1.         As a teenager, she was fascinated with mathematics and embarked on a self-education program, teaching herself, among other things, spherical trigonometry.         After two years at Rhodes Preparatory School in Manhattan, a school attended mostly by adults wishing to pursue college degrees, she was accepted at the age of 15 by Barnard College, where she majored in psychology and received a bachelor's degree in 1928.         Two years later, she completed a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia. She was influenced, she wrote in an autobiography, by the teaching of Harry Hollingworth, for many years chairman of the psychology department at Barnard, and by the writings of Charles Spearman, an English psychologist and statistician who developed the ''two-factor'' theory of intelligence.         At Columbia, she also met her future husband, John Porter Foley Jr., an industrial psychologist. They were married in 1933.         In 1930, Dr. Anastasi was hired as an instructor of psychology at Barnard, and she remained there until 1939, when she became chairwoman of the psychology department at Queens College of the City University of New York. In 1947, she joined the faculty at Fordham, and was promoted to full professor in 1951.         Dr. Anastasi's interests ranged widely, her colleagues and friends said, and she was constantly thinking about human behavior and the ways in which it could be examined. In a series of studies, she investigated creativity in elementary and high school students.         ''She collected drawings, poetry and everything else,'' said Dr. Marvin Reznikoff, a close friend and emeritus professor of psychology at Fordham.         She was also known for a certain indifference to the more practical aspects of daily life. Once, Dr. Procidano said, she heard a shriek coming from Dr. Anastasi's office. Running to see what was wrong, she found Dr. Anastasi trying to pry a plug out of an electrical outlet by using a metal letter opener.         ''Did you get a shock?'' Dr. Procidano asked.         ''How fascinating,'' Dr. Anastasi replied, letter opener in hand. ''How did you know it was a shock?''         In 1987, President Ronald Reagan presented Dr. Anastasi with a National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for scientific achievement. Other psychologists who had received the award included B. F. Skinner and Harry Harlow.         Dr. Anastasi was also active in the professional organizations of her discipline. In 1972, she became the third woman to be elected president of the American Psychological Association. Among numerous other awards, she received the American Psychological Foundation's gold medal for lifetime achievement in 1984.         No immediate family members survive her.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died yesterday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening gowns and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, including Steve Allen, Bennett Cerf and Dorothy Kilgallen. The panelists played a form of 20 Questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The show ran from 1950 until 1975.  Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR from 1960 until 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among the others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control. Oh no, that might ruffle his feathers, Ms. Francis replied. ''I used to call her jokingly America's sweetheart, because she didn't want to offend anybody,'' Ms. Bach said.         Her interview style was breezy. ''She was a very good actress, and convinced the interviewee that she really cared,'' Ms. Bach said.         Soon after the radio program was canceled, Ms. Francis began showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Bach said. She left New York six years ago and went to live in a retirement home in San Francisco to be closer to her son.         Ms. Francis also was a pioneer of morning television, appearing as the host of NBC's ''Home'' newsmagazine in the 1950's.         She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One Two Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, but television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''         But she said she had no regrets.         ''I got so much pleasure out of 'What's My Line?'. There were no rehearsals. You'd just sit there and be yourself and do the best you could,'' she said.         Ms. Francis was born Arlene Francis Kazanjian on Oct. 20, 1907, in Boston, the daughter of an Armenian immigrant. After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married the actor Martin Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter Gabel.       
         Helen Oakley Dance, a journalist and historian of jazz and blues, as well as a record producer, music publisher and personal assistant to musicians like Duke Ellington, Red Norvo, Chick Webb, Johnny Hodges, Bob Crosby and Earl Hines, died on Sunday in Escondido, Calif. She was 88.         Ms. Dance -- who often worked  with her husband, the jazz historian and record producer Stanley Dance -- began as a pioneering female jazz critic in the 1930's but soon began to play a role in exposing a wider American audience to jazz. She insisted on taking the music seriously, and from the start, as a habitué of the swing ballrooms, she distinguished herself from the jitterbuggers by watching from the sidelines.         During that decade, she wrote jazz reviews for Downbeat and other publications, worked for the management organizations of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong and promoted and booked Chick Webb's touring band. She also produced records for the Okeh label and organized the well-promoted swing-band battles at the Savoy Ballroom in New York, which became legendary events.         In 1935, as head of the Chicago Rhythm Club, a fan organization that  booked concerts, she persuaded Benny Goodman to hire the pianist Teddy Wilson, and to bring Goodman's group to play in April 1936 at the  Congress Hotel in Chicago. The event broke ground because it featured an interracial band and because it was one of the earliest American presentations of jazz in a sit-down performance hall. And while working for Irving Mills, Ellington's manager, she sold him on the idea of forming small bands within Ellington's larger orchestra. She soon become the head of artists and repertory for Variety records, which issued a series of recordings by these small bands.         Born in Toronto to a well-to-do family, Ms. Dance attended Ovenden and Trinity Colleges in Toronto and a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In the early 1930's she traveled to London, where she first saw  Ellington perform. Soon after, she rebelled against her family by moving to Detroit, where she intended to work as a jazz singer and later met  Ellington by forging an introductory note to him from a jazz critic. But by 1934 she moved to Chicago and found work writing about and helping to produce jazz concerts. She became a regular contributor to the new Downbeat magazine and was one of the organizers of the famous 1937 Goodman concert at Carnegie Hall.         In 1942 she volunteered for the Women's Army Corps and was assigned to Algiers, where she sent undercover operatives and radio technicians to occupied zones. Later in the war she trained renegade German soldiers as American spies.         Soon after the war she married Mr. Dance, whom she originally met while working for Mills, and they began their 50-year collaboration on  articles, histories and record productions. The family moved to Rowayton, Conn., and from 1964 to 1982, while her husband managed Hines, Ms. Dance ran Hicue, the music publishing company for Hines and Hodges. She also conducted interviews with jazz musicians for the Smithsonian Institution and Rutgers University. In 1971 she wrote ''Stormy Monday'' (Lightning Press), a biography of the blues musician Aaron (T-Bone) Walker.         Ms. Dance also worked in the civil rights movement, founding the Catholic Interracial Council within the Roman Catholic diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., and the Human Relations Commission in Norwalk, Conn.         In 1988 the Helen Oakley Dance and Stanley Dance Archive was established at Yale University, encompassing correspondence, writings, interviews, records, photographs and films; it will become available to researchers later this year. An oral history interview with Ms. Dance, conducted by Patricia Willard, a jazz historian, is part of the Ellington Collection at the National Museum of American History in Washington.         Mr. Dance died in February 1999.         Ms. Dance is survived by sons  Francis, of Woodbury, Conn., and Rupert, of Hopkinton, N.H.; daughters Theresa Bennink-Dance of Peterborough, Ontario, and Maria Lindley of Carlsbad, Calif.; sisters Jacqueline Hickson of New Smyrna Beach, Fla., and Doris Barry of Wilton, Conn.;  brother John Gillespie of Toronto; and three grandchildren.         ''The affinity with jazz which has determined my life was not inherited,'' she told the writer Sally Placksin in the book ''Jazzwomen.'' ''It was a gift. For the record, I was never really career-minded. My priorities were reversed, because I wasn't that hungry for gold. All my feel was for the music and the people who played things you wanted to hear.''       
         Carol Bernstein Ferry, who with her first and second husbands gave millions of dollars of inherited wealth to support causes like the Black Panthers, prisoners' rights and opposition to the Vietnam War, took her own life early Saturday morning at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 76.         After a lifetime of using money to make political points, Ms. Ferry made her final argument, for legalized euthanasia, by lying down as loved ones looked on and taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Last June, doctors told her that she was terminally ill. She had a tumor in her abdomen and failing lungs.         ''My decision has been arrived at after many years of contemplation, not quickly or casually,'' she wrote in a letter. ''I hope it will help others to feel all right about preferring a peaceful, benign path into death.''         At the height of her influence, she and her first husband, Daniel Bernstein, became known in leftist circles as the place to go for ''the loot,'' as she called it. For many years, she scoured the morning mail weighing requests for money for political causes. Sometimes she sent money without being asked. She visited many prisons, including Sing Sing, where for years she taught reading to inmates.         David McReynolds of the War Resisters League said her generosity was unconditional. ''They never attached a single thread to the money,'' he said.         Carol Underwood was born in Syracuse on July 29, 1924. She lived in Auburn, N.Y., until her parents divorced when she was 4. She grew up in Portland, Maine, and graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y.         In 1946, she moved to Manhattan to work as a secretary, copy editor and proofreader for McGraw-Hill and other publishers. She met Mr. Bernstein, a stockbroker with Loeb Rhoades, and they were married in 1953.         While he was recuperating from knee surgery at their Scarsdale, N.Y., home in 1956, Mr. Bernstein decided to work as an independent stockbroker. He considered himself a liberal and had earlier helped set up the National Scholarship Fund and Service for Negro Students, working with Jim Robinson, a Harlem minister.         According to a daughter, Katharine Bernstein of Brattleboro, Vt., she had not initially been leftist but became increasingly persuaded by her husband's increasingly leftist opinions.         In 1960, he suggested an Easter family vacation to Cuba. His wife at first demurred. ''Would you have gone before the revolution?'' he asked.         She said yes and agreed to go. The couple returned so enthusiastic about Fidel Castro's revolution that most of Mr. Bernstein's brokerage clients dropped him.         Their political sensibilities moved ever leftward. Mr. Bernstein bought full-page advertisements in The New York Times to protest the Vietnam War.         One of their philanthropic vehicles was the DJB Foundation, which Mr. Bernstein created in 1948 to hold his father's inheritance. At first, it was relatively inactive, as Mr. Bernstein funneled money out of pocket to causes that were not tax deductible.         With Mr. Bernstein's death from leukemia in 1970 at 51, the foundation received $6 million of his wealth. It then became more active.         Vincent McGee, who in 1972 had just left federal prison after serving time for resisting the draft, asked for money to go to Hanoi to bring back some prisoners of war.         She responded by mail: ''Dear Vinny: Here's a check for $3,000. I am glad to send it. There are three things about this money business: asking, saying 'no,' or saying 'yes.' The first two are hard, but the third is easy when the purpose is good and the funds are there.''         Mr. McGee went on to work for DJB and then other foundations.         In 1973, she married Wilbur H. Ferry, a foundation employee who wrote books on the problems of a capitalist society. The couple spent DJB's money by May 1975, as planned, and then gave from their personal funds. He died in 1995, and Ms. Ferry continued the mission.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Ferry is survived by a son, John Bernstein of Guilford, Vt.; four stepchildren, Dennie LaTourelle of Carpenteria, Calif., Fay Bisno of Norwich, Vt., Robin Ferry of Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, and Lucien Ferry of Blue Sea Lake, Quebec; and a brother, Arthur Underwood of Denver.       
         Adele Dellenbaugh Hofmann, a pediatrician who helped tailor medical science to the needs of teenagers, died on Friday at a hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 74 and lived in nearby Laguna Beach.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         A practitioner of pediatrics for nearly 50 years, Dr. Hofmann was a leader in a movement to redefine how health professionals treated minors. She blended her knowledge of endocrinology, pediatrics, psychology and general medicine to shape  adolescent care into a pediatric specialty.         Dr. Hofmann was a founder of the Society for Adolescent Medicine, based in Blue Springs, Mo. and served as its president in 1976-77. The next year she founded the Section on Adolescent Health as a unit within the American Academy of Pediatrics; the section now gives an award in her name.         Dr. Hofmann contended that the passage to adulthood and emancipation meant difficult years for both child and parent.         ''What we're talking about is a decade,'' she once said, ''an age of human growth and development that has tremendously unique things happening emotionally and biologically.''         Over the years she published many articles on the legal rights of minors, teenage behavior and sexuality, and youths with special risks. Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Donald Graydanus wrote the authoritative textbook ''Adolescent Medicine.'' First published in 1986, it won an award from the American College of Internal Medicine the year after and went into its third edition in 1997 at McGraw Hill, where it remains in print.         She also wrote ''The Hospitalized Adolescent'' (1976), which received an American Nurses Association award, and ''Consent and Confidentiality in Child and Adolescent Care'' (1984).         Adele Dellenbaugh was born in Boston, a granddaughter of Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh, an artist, writer and explorer. She graduated from Smith College in 1948 and from the University of Rochester Medical School in 1952.         She trained at Babies Hospital of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and was a National Foundation Fellow in Endocrinology at Presbyterian Hospital. She directed pediatric and adolescent programs at New York University, Bellevue Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in New York. After moving to California, she was affiliated with the Children's Hospital of Orange County and the University of California at Irvine.         Dr. Hofmann's marriage to Dr. Frederick G. Hofmann ended in divorce. He died in 1992. She is survived by a daughter, Annie Gardiner of Oakland, Calif., and a son, Peter, of Middletown, Conn.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died on Thursday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening dresses and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, who played a form of 20 questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The actress, along with Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf, appeared on the show for 15 years, with John Daly as the genial moderator. Steve Allen and Fred Allen also were panelists for a brief period in the 1950's. After the original ''What's My Line?'' ended its run in 1967, the show was revived as a syndicated series the next year. Ms. Francis was the new show's only panelist from the old one, and it had a new host, Walter Bruner.         Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR in New York from 1960 to 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control. Oh, no, that might ruffle his feathers, Ms. Francis replied. ''I used to call her jokingly America's sweetheart, because she didn't want to offend anybody,'' Ms. Bach said.         Her style was breezy. ''She was a very good actress and convinced the interviewee that she really cared,'' Ms. Bach said.         Soon after the radio program was canceled, Ms. Francis began showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Bach said. She left New York six years ago and went to live in a retirement home in San Francisco to be closer to her son.         Ms. Francis also was a pioneer of morning television, appearing as the host of NBC's ''Home'' newsmagazine in the 1950's.         She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One, Two, Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, where her Broadway credits included ''All That Glitters'' (1938), ''The Walking Gentleman'' (1942), ''The Overtons'' (1945) and ''The Little Blue Light'' (1951), in which she appeared with Melvyn Douglas, Burgess Meredith and her husband, Martin Gabel.         But television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it, and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''         But she said she had no regrets.         ''I got so much pleasure out of 'What's My Line?' There were no rehearsals. You'd just sit there and be yourself and do the best you could,'' she said.         Ms. Francis was born Arlene Francis Kazanjian on Oct. 20, 1907, in Boston, the daughter of an Armenian immigrant. After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married Mr. Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter.       
         Rosemary Verey, the tough, artistic English gardener who brought the art of clipped boxwoods, laburnum walks and ornamental vegetable gardening to America, died in Chelsea Memorial Hospital in London on May 31. She was 82.         ''She was a marvelous lecturer and she knew so much,'' said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He first heard her speak about her famous garden at Barnsley House, a 17th-century rectory in the Cotswolds of England, about 20 years ago at the Horticultural Alliance of the Hamptons.         The four-acre garden was her working laboratory, where she domesticated elements from legendary gardens, like the yellow-flowering laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, in North Wales, or the ornamental potager, or vegetable garden, at the Chateau de Villandry, in the Loire Valley in France, and made them seem possible for the home gardener.         Mr. Long remembers staring longingly at the slides of the neo-Classical temple that Mrs. Verey's husband, David Verey, an architectural historian, had dismantled in an English park and rebuilt himself, stone by stone.         ''It was a really good lesson in garden-building,'' Mr. Long said. ''None of this redwood pergola stuff from catalogues.''         Years later, when he became the president of the New York Botanical Garden, he would ask her to design an ornamental vegetable garden for the Bronx, complete with cold frames for extending the seasons and herbs that are used by gardeners from other cultures. She was working on the design with the sculptor Simon Verity the week that she died of pneumonia, possibly contracted while flying to Cincinnati and on to Kentucky to work on gardens there.         She was mentor to many American garden leaders like Marco Polo Stufano, who transformed Wave Hill, the public garden in the Riverdale section of the Bronx; Robert Dash, the painter who created the Madoo Conservancy, on the East End of Long Island, and Mr. Long.         Ms. Verey wrote more than a dozen garden books including ''The Classic Garden'' and ''The Garden in Winter,'' which were seminal works for Americans interested in design and sophisticated use of plants, with color and texture year-round.         In her later years, she designed gardens for British celebrities like Prince Charles and Elton John. But her favorite people were gardeners. She often gave them cuttings and seeds from plants she herself had clipped or gathered from such legendary gardens as Gethsemane, outside the city of Jerusalem, or Monet's garden at Giverny.         For more than 20 years she redesigned the grounds around Barnsley House, which is near Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, first with her laburnum arch, which dangles chains of gold flowers over purple alliums in May. Her husband laid the path beneath, a mosaic of colorful stone and pebbles collected from the Pembrokeshire beaches.         ''She had an impeccable eye for color, an ability to embroider gold against purple,'' said Mr. Dash, whose gardens at Madoo, in Sagaponack, N.Y., are widely considered an American work of art. ''She took that grim forbidding aristocratic face off English gardening, and with her charm and her writings, gave it a friendly, domesticated face.''         Mr. Dash and Ms. Verey would occasionally lecture together, playfully arguing over whose garden was more original and just who stole from whom. Did Ms. Verey really swipe her famous laburnum arch from Bodnant?         ''Of course!'' Mr. Dash said, laughing. ''But my laburnum arch bears no resemblance to hers. It's a question of following your own light.''         She studied mathematics and economics at University College in London, but left before earning her degree to marry Mr. Verey in 1939, and proceeded to raise four children, like a proper English gentlewoman of her day. She was an accomplished horsewoman, until she fell in a hunting accident.         ''A horse rolled over on her,'' Mr. Dash said. ''So her husband gave her a book on mandrakes that piqued her interest.'' And a temple just to get her started.         A scholar and perfectionist, she began to read widely, collecting rare first editions usually seen only in the British Museum or the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library. Her redesign project began in 1950, and the grounds opened to the public in 1970. By the time her husband died in 1984, she had started a new career, and a garden that would eventually attract 30,000 visitors a year.         She lectured widely in the United States, where she made five or six trips a year to cities like New York, Seattle, Atlanta or Chicago, or to Indiana and Kentucky. ''Flower shows in winter and the garden clubs in spring and summer,'' Mr. Long said. ''We began to see a lot of laburnum arches in the Hamptons.''         She took many young gardeners under her wing, drilling them in the Latin names of plants, and shooing them off for the day to plunge into the great gardens of England.         ''She would get very cross with us if we didn't speak to the head gardener,'' recalled Mr. Stufano, who with his companion, John Nally, spent many days in the gardens at Barnsley. ''Her garden was a very personal garden. She was always trying new things. It had the feeling of someone who loved plants and she was out in it constantly. She was a wonderful cook and one of my fond memories is being sent out to the garden for a few marrows, or zucchinis, for dinner.''         Long before Mr. Long became president of the New York Botanical Garden, he made a gardener's pilgrimage to Barnsley, to learn some secrets for his place upstate. He had been happily wandering about in the rain, poking about as gardeners do, when he saw her looking out the window.         ''She was so imposing in those days, I was a bit intimidated by her,'' he said. ''I almost wished that she not come out. She showed me Phlomis fruticosa, which is a silver-leafed thing with yellow flowers in the fall. I tried to grow it at home and couldn't.''         Then she locked the gate and invited him in for drinks. Years later, at his own garden upstate, she sat on his compost pile and showed him how to dry the bulbs he had carelessly thrown away. They bloomed the next year.         Her influence was not restricted to naïve Americans. David Wheeler, the editor of Hortus, a garden quarterly in England, who has built, with the artist Simon Dorell, a garden on the edge of Wales, was also nurtured by Ms. Verey, who opened up her library, garden and larder to him.         She was a great networker, or Miss Fix-It, as Mr. Wheeler put it. When he admitted that he would like to meet Prince Charles, she simply rang him up. ''Be here at 5,'' she said.'' ''We're expected at Highgrove at 6.''         Her vegetable garden, a tapestry of ever-changing cabbages, lettuces, strawberries, hop vines and espaliered fruit trees, ''has become a cliché copied around the world,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''But she made us look at growing vegetables in these times of peace and well-being. We were no longer digging for victory and growing rows of vegetables. We could do this decoratively.''         She also reinvented the formal garden, he said, with little parterres of clipped boxwood. ''Those had been part of the English garden since Elizabethan times,'' he said, ''but it had all but washed away with modernism and the 20th century.''         In 1999, Ms. Verey received a special award from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for her work with English gardens, and the same year, was given the Royal Horticultural Society's most distinguished award, the Victoria Medal of Honor.         She leaves two sons and two daughters. Over the last two years, her son Charles has overseen the gardens, which are still open to the public. ''But the eye is gone,'' Mr. Dash said. ''The artist is gone.''       
         Dr. Pamela Hilliard Robertson, a rookie astronaut, died on May 24 from injuries sustained two days earlier in a small-plane crash. She was 38.         The accident took place just outside Houston, where Dr. Robertson was based at the Johnson Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.         The pilot, Roy Adams of Alvin, Tex., was said to have been practicing takeoffs and landings with Dr. Robertson, a flight instructor, when the aircraft struck trees and burst into flames. Mr. Adams, 46, suffered severe burns.         Dr. Robertson, of Homer City, Pa., completed her training in 1998 and was scheduled to fly her first mission next year to the International Space Station as a crew-support astronaut.         Born in Indiana, Pa., she graduated with a degree in biology from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1985 and from the Medical College of Pennsylvania four years later. After a residency in family medicine, she trained in space medicine at the University of Texas and at the Johnson Space Center.         She joined the NASA Flight Medicine Clinic at the center before being selected as an astronaut. Besides being a medical doctor, she was a flight instructor with more than 1,500 hours of flight time.         She is survived by her husband, Scott Robertson, and her mother, Ilse Hilliard of Homer City.         Correction:  June 28, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on June 8 about an astronaut at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston misstated her given name. She was Dr. Patricia Hilliard Robertson, not Pamela.       
         Maria Chabot, who in the 1930's began the popular Indian markets on the Plaza in Santa Fe, N.M., and later became a close associate of the painter Georgia O'Keeffe, died on Monday in an Albuquerque hospital. She was 87.         Her goal was to be a writer, but her varied life included long periods  as a rancher, as well as acting as general contractor for the house O'Keeffe built on a hilltop in Abiquiu, N.M., which in 1998 was designated a national monument. She took the well-known picture of O'Keeffe on the back of a motorcycle titled ''Women Who Rode Away.''         The Saturday markets for Indian crafts eventually became a daily event, and today they draw more than two million people a year, spending millions on pottery, jewelry and other items made by Indians. But when the markets began in the Depression, the Indians were lucky to get a few dollars for pieces that now reside in museums.         The Indians lacked cars and pickup trucks to get to the market, so one of Ms. Chabot's first initiatives was to rent school buses, she said in an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican in 1996. After the first Indian market, eight of the vendors told her they were using their earnings to install running water in their homes.         Ms. Chabot began the markets in her capacity as executive secretary of the New Mexico Association of Indian Affairs, an advocacy group, with the goal of bringing broader awareness of the artfulness of Indian crafts. At first, the endeavor faced  intense opposition from local businesses.         Later, she helped Indians market their works more broadly by working for the Federal Indian Arts and Crafts Board, setting up cooperative marketing enterprises on reservations throughout the West.         She noticed that many people felt good about paying higher prices for Indian arts. ''Maybe it's guilt for what we did to them,'' she said in an  interview with CNN in 1994.         Ms. Chabot's paternal grandfather was the English ambassador to Mexico in the Mexican Revolution in 1910. His family, including Ms. Chabot's father, fled Mexico City, traveling by horse-drawn wagon. The family settled in San Antonio, where she was born in September 1913.         After graduating from high school at 15, she took a job as a copywriter. She then visited Mexico City to study Spanish and archaeology, making friends there with some New Mexicans. She moved to Santa Fe in 1931 at 18, according to John S. Hart, a neighbor and friend.         In her 20's, she made her way to the East Coast, took a freighter to Europe and spent two years traveling and working in France. She studied art and picked grapes in the vineyards of Provence.         After returning to Santa Fe, she took a job with the federal Works Progress Administration, the Depression-era project to find work for artists and writers. The agency provided her with a Model T Ford and a Brownie camera. Her assignment was to photograph and document Native American and Spanish Colonial arts and crafts.         She met Mary Cabot Wheelwright, the well-known collector of Indian artifacts, when she photographed Ms. Wheelwright's extensive collection. Ms. Wheelwright's collection of Navajo art is now housed in the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe.         For 20 years, Ms. Chabot managed Ms. Wheelwright's ranch at Alcalde, N.M. She hired the labor, supervised the cattle herd and oversaw the care of 1,500 fruit trees. She was president of the local irrigation association, an unheard-of post for a woman at the time, and adjudicated heated disputes over irrigation ditches.         Ms. Wheelwright eventually deeded the ranch to Ms. Chabot, who sold it in the 1960's to move to Albuquerque to care for her elderly mother.         In 1936, Ms. Chabot was named head of the Indian advocacy group. Her idea for the weekly fairs stemmed from visits to Mexico, where she saw that the Indians seemed better off than those north of the border. ''The difference was New Mexico's American Indians did not have a market for their goods and the Indians in Mexico did,'' she said in an interview with The New Mexican in 1996.         Part of her job was visiting pueblos, Indian villages, to encourage women, especially potters, to participate. One was Maria Martinez, the legendary potter of the San Idelfonso pueblo.         After her work with the Indians, Ms. Chabot was introduced to Georgia O'Keeffe by Ms. Wheelwright, beginning a friendship that endured until O'Keeffe's death in 1986.         She spent summers from 1941 through 1944 at O'Keeffe's house on the Ghost Ranch, 125 miles north of Albuquerque. Though her goal was to write, she spent most of her time managing activities at the ranch.         She often accompanied O'Keeffe on the camping trips throughout northern New Mexico on which the artist created many of her paintings. Among them is one called ''Maria Goes to a Party.''         In 1946, Ms. Chabot agreed to manage the rebuilding of an adobe hacienda on a hilltop in Abiquiu, 48 miles northwest of Santa Fe. She supervised the building crew and participated in design decisions for what became O'Keeffe's winter home.         ''I had never found anything as romantic as this beat-up building, a ruin really,'' Ms. Chabot said in an interview with The Albuquerque Journal in 1999 when the house was dedicated as a national landmark. ''It took six months just to get the pigs out of the house.''         She was married for six months in 1961 to Dana K. Bailey, a radio astronomer for the Los Alamos National Laboratory. ''We were much better as friends than as husband and wife,'' she told Mr. Hart, her neighbor.         She has no immediate survivors. A book of the hundreds of letters exchanged between her and O'Keeffe, with commentary, will be published posthumously, Mr. Hart said.         He said that Ms. Chabot was often astounded about the mistaken judgments of outsiders. One author said about how much the two women enjoyed riding horses. Ms. Chabot told her friend that she had never seen  O'Keeffe on a horse.         In 1996, when she was named a ''Living Treasure'' of Santa Fe, Ms. Chabot was asked about her wide experiences. ''You just live your life,'' she said, ''you don't try to do anything.''       
         Katharine Graham, who transformed The Washington Post from a mediocre newspaper into an American institution and, in the process, transformed herself from a shy widow into a publishing legend, died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a fall on a sidewalk on Saturday in Idaho. She was 84.         Mrs. Graham had been attending a business conference in Sun Valley. She was flown to a hospital in Boise, where she underwent brain surgery but never recovered consciousness, her son Donald E. Graham said.         Mrs. Graham was one of the most powerful figures in American journalism and, for the last decades of her life, at the pinnacle of Washington's political and social establishments, a position this insecure wife and mother never imagined she would, or could, occupy.         It was only after she succeeded her father and her husband as president and later publisher of The Washington Post, a newspaper with a modest circulation and more modest reputation, that it moved into the front rank of American newspapers, reaching new heights when its unrelenting reporting of the Watergate scandal contributed to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.         Mrs. Graham's courage in supporting her reporters and editors through the long investigation was critical to its success. Three years before Watergate, she gave solid backing to The New York Times in a historic confrontation with the government when she permitted her editors to join in publishing the secret revelations about the war in Vietnam known as the Pentagon Papers.         Mrs. Graham would have been the first to say the single greatest decision of her professional career was not in publishing the Pentagon Papers nor in exposing the Watergate scandal but in hiring Benjamin C. Bradlee to be her editor. With her support he forged a staff of reporters and editors that made The Washington Post a force in the capital and in the world of journalism.         Mrs. Graham capped her career when she was 80 years old in 1998 by winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography for her often painful reminiscence, ''Personal History'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Nora Ephron, in her review of the best-selling memoir in The New York Times Book Review, wrote of Mrs. Graham, ''The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.''         Mrs. Graham was a socialite mother of four when her husband, Philip L. Graham, committed suicide in 1963. Her father had given Mr. Graham control of The Post and when the latter died, his widow found herself in a mysterious thicket of corporate politics dominated by men unaccustomed to a woman in the boardroom and highly skeptical of her ability to run a newspaper.         Mrs. Graham saw herself at best as only as an interim caretaker who would try to hold on to The Post for her children. She became something quite different -- the effective steward of a multimillion-dollar communications empire.         ''It's sort of like a fairy tale,'' Mrs. Graham said on being told of her Pulitzer Prize. But her life was its own sort of fairy tale.         She was born in New York City on June 16, 1917. Her father, Eugene Meyer, made his fortune on Wall Street, became a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, went on to organize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and was appointed the first president of the World Bank. Her mother, the former Agnes Ernst, was a tall, self-absorbed woman of intellectual and artistic ambition. She was scathingly critical and often harsh with her daughter, the fourth of five children.         The children were brought up in the traditions of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, the church of presidents, where the Meyers -- Mr. Meyer was Jewish, his wife Lutheran -- had their own pew. Mrs. Graham remembered a lonely childhood in palatial houses in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and in Washington. Her father was often away working, her mother traveling and writing  letters home about her social conquests.         In the absence of maternal warmth and support, Katharine became attached to her governess. Later, she went to the Madeira School for Girls in Virginia. She spent two years at Vassar before transferring to the University of Chicago. Neither of her parents attended her graduation in 1938.         When Katharine was 16, no one thought to tell her that her father had bid $825,000 at public auction to buy the bankrupt Washington Post, a paper with a circulation of 50,000 that was losing a million dollars a year, the fifth newspaper in a five-newspaper town. Later, with yearnings of her own to get into journalism, she took a job at The San Francisco News before going to The Post to work on the editorial page and handle letters to the editor. ''If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of her,'' her father said.         'The Tail to His Kite'         Washington, in 1939, was full of young people converging on the capital to work for The New Deal. Among them was Philip L. Graham of Florida, a brilliant lawyer and a clerk at the Supreme Court, first for Justice Stanley Reed and then for Felix Frankfurter. Shy and insecure, Katharine Meyer could not believe her luck when he asked her to marry him. The heiress agreed to his terms -- that they return to Florida and his father's dairy business, provided, she remembered, that ''I could live with only two dresses because I had to understand that he would never take anything from my father or be involved with him and we would live on what he made.''         It did not work out that way, and Mr. Graham soon accepted his father-in-law's invitation to join The Post. He became associate publisher at 30 and publisher at 31. Mr. Meyer also arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his daughter because, he explained to her, ''no man should be in the position of working for his wife.'' Mrs. Graham did not object because she knew how important it was to her father to keep The Post in the family, and, she wrote, ''in those days, of course, the only possible heir would have been a male.''         Mrs. Graham was belittled and silenced by a husband she adored, the man she called ''the fizz'' in her life. When he drank too much, gave vent to his rage or frequently became ill, she attributed it to the pressure of his work and not to a serious emotional affliction that had not yet been identified.         ''Our relationship resembled that of a chief executive officer Phil and a chief operating officer me,'' Mrs. Graham wrote in her memoir. In addition to handling all domestic matters, she paid all their living expenses from her own trust fund so her husband could pay back the debt he incurred buying even more Post stock.         Mr. Graham was immersed in building up The Washington Post, conducting negotiations to buy the rival Times-Herald and merging it with his paper, and waging political battles as The Post took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his brand of anti-communism. Later Mr. Graham became an even more influential figure in Washington, a close friend of President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.         ''I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,'' Mrs. Graham wrote.         Mr. Graham had his first breakdown in 1957. His recovery was slow, but he eventually re-emerged into Washington life. In 1961, at the urging of Mr. Bradlee, then a young reporter at Newsweek, he negotiated the purchase of the weekly newsmagazine. He also added television stations to the company's holdings.         What his wife later described as his ''hyperactivity, rage and irrationality'' grew. Mrs. Graham was shattered when she discovered that her husband was having an affair with a Newsweek employee. But there was an added blow: she discovered he had a scheme to pay her off and take ownership of The Post, in which he already had controlling interest because her father had given him the majority of Class A shares.         But she decided to fight back. She resolved not to give her husband a divorce unless he gave up enough controlling stock in the Post to give her majority interest.         Mr. Graham became increasingly ill and was in and out of a mental hospital. Finally, his illness had a name, manic depression. The kinds of drugs that were later developed for his condition were not available then, and Mr. Graham, on the advice of his psychiatrist, refused such drugs that were in use. In August 1963, while on a weekend leave from the hospital, Philip Graham, then 48 years old, took one of his hunting rifles and shot himself to death at their farm in Virginia.         Holding On to The Post         As she mourned, the 46-year-old widow sought ways to hold on to The Post until her sons were old enough to run it. (Her daughter was not a candidate in her plan.) Mrs. Graham wrote that she was startled when her friend Luvie Pearson, the wife of the columnist Drew Pearson, told her to run the paper herself. ''Don't be silly, dear. You can do it,'' Mrs. Pearson told her. ''You've got all those genes. . . . You've just been pushed down so far you don't recognize what you can do.''         Mrs. Graham met with the directors of The Post a month after her husband's death and told them that the paper would not be sold and that it would remain in the family. She was elected president of the company, but she felt ''abysmally ignorant'' about how to proceed.         She said she was embarrassed to talk to her own reporters, timid in dealing with the paper's executives and uncomfortable with balance sheets. Both at The Post and in the wider journalistic community, Mrs. Graham was usually the only woman at meetings and dinners. The men hardly knew what to make of her.         Although she had absorbed a great deal over the years from both her father and her husband, she did not feel up to the job as she tried to learn from the top. With the advice and support of friends like the columnists Walter Lippmann and James Reston, she began to feel some level of comfort at The Post, but she still felt shaky at Newsweek, where she went through a series of hirings and firings that some staff members recall as creating havoc at the magazine.         Two years after taking over The Post, she hired Mr. Bradlee, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, to be deputy managing editor and then quickly moved him up to executive editor. They made a formidable team, propelling The Post into one of its most dynamic periods. With Mrs. Graham's backing, Mr. Bradlee forged a staff of reporters and editors and put out a breezy, gutsy paper that investigated government with gusto. A saucy, impertinent Style section appeared that would soon be imitated by competitors but never matched.         Mr. Bradlee's brassy style galvanized his staff and invigorated his publisher.         'The Most Powerful Woman'         As Mrs. Graham struggled to take hold at The Post, she slowly started putting her personal life together. Truman Capote gave what could only be called a coming-out party for her, the Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York, which was not only  the social event of the 1966 season, but also a masked ball of such glamour that it is considered one of the legendary parties of the 20th century.         She wrote, ''For one magic night I was transformed.''         Mrs. Graham's memoir quoted Gerald Clarke, one of Mr. Capote's biographers, as saying: ''She was arguably the most powerful woman in the country, but still largely unknown outside Washington. Putting her in the spotlight was also his ultimate act as Pygmalion. It would symbolize her emergence from her dead husband's shadow; she would become her own woman before the entire world.''         In 1969, and still with considerable trepidation, Mrs. Graham added the title of publisher to her position as president of the Washington Post Company.         In June 1971, The New York Times started publishing the secret history of decision-making during the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. After a few days, a federal judge put The Times under a temporary restraining order, the first time in American history that such an order of prior restraint had been imposed.         The editors and reporters at The Post scrambled to get their own copy of the Pentagon Papers. There was a crisis atmosphere, for at the same time the Washington Post Company was in the process of being taken public, raising concerns that the company could face harsh retribution from federal regulators if it published the Pentagon Papers while The New York Times was enjoined. When The Post obtained its own copy, it was left to Mrs. Graham, as publisher, to decide whether to risk publication.         The editors and reporters urged her to publish the papers, but the lawyers suggested waiting, fearing the whole company -- its newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations -- was at stake. Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go. Let's publish.' ''         At the Supreme Court, the Times and Post cases were heard together, and the justices voted, 6 to 3, on June 30, 1971, against restraining publication of the Pentagon Papers on the ground of endangering national security. That vote is considered a major triumph for freedom of the press.         Mr. Bradlee called the publication of the Pentagon Papers a key moment in the life of the newspaper. ''It was just sort of the graduation of The Post into the highest ranks,'' he said. ''One of our unspoken goals was to get the world to refer to The Post and New York Times in the same breath, which they previously hadn't done. After the Pentagon Papers, they did.''         In a statement yesterday, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, said:         ''We are deeply saddened by the passing of Katharine Graham, a close friend and honored colleague. She will be remembered as a truly remarkable woman, who had a profound effect on the course of events, both at home and abroad. Throughout the last half of the 20th century, she used her intelligence, her courage and her wit to transform the landscape of American journalism, and everyone who cares about a free and impartial press will greatly miss her. We certainly will.''         Weathering Watergate         On June 17, 1972, five months before Nixon's re-election, five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex. The Post began an intense investigation that eventually connected the break-in to the White House.         In the face of intimidation by the Nixon administration, The Post relentlessly published front-page articles by two little-known reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and complemented them with editorials and Herblock cartoons. It eventually proved that what the Nixon administration characterized as a ''third-rate burglary'' was, instead, a scheme directed from the White House to illegally gather intelligence on the Democratic Party, discredit opponents of the administration and subvert the democratic political process.         The Post was alone on reporting Watergate for so long that Mrs. Graham was constantly asking herself, ''If this is such a hell of a story, then where is everybody else?''         In the course of the paper's investigation, the licenses of two of the company's television stations were challenged. Mrs. Graham was advised never to be alone and was also threatened with unspecified retaliation if The Post published an article that said John Mitchell, when he was attorney general, controlled a secret fund that was used to spy on the Democrats. Mr. Mitchell memorably  warned Mr. Bernstein that ''Katie Graham'' would have a breast ''caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.'' Bob Woodward later presented Mrs. Graham with an old-fashioned wooden laundry wringer, which she kept in her office ever after.         At the beginning of the next year the Watergate burglars pleaded guilty, and one of them, hoping to get a more lenient sentence, wrote to John J. Sirica, a federal district judge, to inform him that perjury had been committed and that higher-ups were behind the break-in. That letter vindicated the time and space The Post had devoted to the scandal. For its Watergate reporting, the newspaper was awarded the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.         Meanwhile, the Senate began investigating the scandal and a special prosecutor was appointed. In April 1973, Nixon accepted some responsibility. But in July, it was disclosed that a taping system in the Oval Office had recorded his every word. The tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover-up. He resigned in August 1974.         Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Without the tapes, the true story would never have emerged. In fact, I believe that we at The Post were really saved in the end by the tapes and the lucky chance that they weren't destroyed.''         Meeting the Elite         In time, as Mrs. Graham became more comfortable with her ability to exercise power, she took trips to confer with foreign leaders, usually accompanied by one of the reporters and her friend Meg Greenfield, who was editor of the editorial page of The Post and a columnist for Newsweek. Mrs. Graham liked to tell the story of her visit to a village in the Ivory Coast where the chief exclaimed what an honor it was to have with them the 17th most important person in the world, a description that she said he had apparently picked up from a poll that had appeared in U.S. News & World Report.         In Washington she started to entertain the political elite at her home in Georgetown and an invitation from her came to be seen as second only to an invitation to the White House.         President Bush recalled in a statement yesterday how Mrs. Graham had welcomed him and his wife, Laura, to Washington with a dinner at her home, as she had with other presidents. He called her ''a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others.''         The ''A'' list of the world attended her parties. By the time of her 70th birthday, she had become so powerful a figure that Art Buchwald said in his toast at her party, ''There is one word that brings us all together here tonight. And that word is 'fear.' ''         With the help of the women's movement, and particularly through discussions with Gloria Steinem, Mrs. Graham said she became more cognizant of the causes of her own insecurities and more aware of the problems of working women. She played a signal role in changing Washington mores when it became widely known that on one evening after dinner, she had refused to join the ladies upstairs while the men discussed world affairs over brandy and cigars. And  more women were added to the staffs of both The Post and Newsweek, partly because Mrs. Graham came to understand it was necessary, partly as a result of lawsuits, and partly because of a new climate throughout the country.         Over the years, she found a little time for a personal life. She was courted by a number of men, among them Adlai E. Stevenson after his failed runs for the presidency. She enjoyed weekends at her homes in Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, often in the company of her grandchildren.         Besides her son Donald, she is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Weymouth, known as Lally; her sons William and Stephen; a sister, Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         The funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday at the National Cathedral in Washington.         The Business of News         Mrs. Graham's resolve on editorial questions often contrasted with indecisiveness on business matters. In the 1970's, she acknowledged in her book, she hired and dismissed top executives at Newsweek, the newspaper division and the Washington Post Company too frequently.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Graham and her associates tried to make the Washington Post Company more profitable. Newsweek took the lead among news magazines in increasing subscription and newsstand prices. But holding down costs at The Washington Post led to a bitter confrontation with the mechanical unions.         The clash came in October 1975, when the newspaper's pressmen went on strike after contract talks broke down. As the pressmen, members of Local 6 of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, began their walkout, all 72 of the newspaper's presses were vandalized.         Although the paper failed to publish on the first day, a truncated issue appeared the next day. In the face of threats from the striking workers and occasional physical attacks, the reporters voted to stay on the job. Executives handled the classified advertising department, the mailroom and even the presses when they were repaired. Helicopters landed on the roof of The Post building to ferry copy to presses in Maryland and Virginia. It took nearly a month to repair the presses, but The Post continued to appear.         Mrs. Graham not only went on to win the battle of automation of her newspaper, but also to have the final word on a competitor, the financially troubled Washington Star.  The Post had 75 percent of the city's advertising linage by 1981, and The Star was forced to close. By the end of 1981, The Post's daily circulation had soared to 984,000 from 771,000.         Donald Graham succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979 and chief executive of the company in 1991, a company which by then was valued at nearly $2 billion. Mrs. Graham stepped down as chairwoman of the board in 1993, again to be succeeded by her son, but remained on the board as chairwoman of the executive committee.         Mrs. Graham served on the board of The Associated Press, and was chairwoman and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. and a trustee of George Washington University, the University of Chicago and the Urban Institute.         Finally, she seemed comfortable with herself. ''Worry, if not gone altogether, no longer haunts you in the middle of the night,'' she wrote. ''And you are free -- or freer -- to turn down the things that bore you and spend time on matters and with people you enjoy.''         And she did, till the end. Just two weeks ago she was surrounded by friends at the annual party her daughter gave for her in Southampton, N.Y., and last week was in Idaho for a conference of media executives where she saw more friends and colleagues. She was on her way to a bridge game when she fell.         Katharine Graham's life ended the way she said she wanted it to: ''The only thing I think any of us want,'' she once said, ''is to last as long as we're any good. And then not.''       
         Eudora Welty, whose evocative short stories, notable for their imagery, sharp dialogue and fierce wit, made her a revered figure in contemporary American letters, died yesterday at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 92.         She was plagued by health problems and had been confined for some time to her home, where she had lived since high school and where she wrote most of her stories, novels, essays, memoirs and book reviews.         As a short-story master, Miss Welty is often mentioned by critics in the same breath as Chekhov, but she was  dismissed early in her career as a regionalist and did not earn widespread critical respect until she was no longer young. When recognition came, she accepted it with the ease, modesty and grace that had become her hallmarks.         She was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel ''The Optimist's Daughter.'' She also received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, several O. Henry Awards and the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and received the Medal of Freedom in 1980, presented, she said happily, by ''one of my great Southern heroes, President Jimmy Carter.''         Late in 1998 Miss Welty said she was ''excited and delighted'' to learn that she had become the first living writer to be included in the prestigious Library of America series of collected works by United States literary giants. The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.         For decades she was pigeonholed by critics who placed her with Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers as a writer of the so-called Southern School. Her reputation as a regional and apolitical writer was often cited as a reason for her failure to win a Nobel Prize. But her work, like that of those other Southern writers, transcended region and possessed a universal relevance and appeal.         ''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980. ''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''         A Clan of Readers         Eudora Welty was born on April 13, 1909, in Jackson, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty, an Ohio native, and the former Chestina Andrews, who had been a West Virginia schoolteacher. The Weltys settled in Jackson shortly after their marriage, and Mr. Welty became an executive of the Lamar Life Insurance company. They also had two sons younger than Miss Welty.         The Weltys were devoted to books and learning. In ''One Writer's Beginnings,'' Miss Welty's 1984 memoir based on a series of lectures she gave at Harvard, she recalled the exhilaration she felt when she fell under the spell of books.         ''It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that storybooks had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass,'' she wrote. ''Yet regardless of where they came from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''         Miss Welty was a daily visitor to the local Andrew Carnegie Library, where she was allowed what she later called ''a sweet devouring'' -- a ration of two books a day by the stern-faced librarian. Several decades later, in 1986, the building was replaced; the new one was named the Eudora Welty Library.         Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.         ''It took Latin to thrust me into a bona fide alliance with words in their true meaning,'' she wrote. ''Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence. I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''         'Listening for Stories'         Miss Welty said she discovered stories in daily life. ''Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories,'' she wrote in 1984. ''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''         Miss Welty attended the Mississippi State College for Women, where she helped to start a literary magazine, and then the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1929. After college Miss Welty told her parents that she wanted to be a writer, but she said that her father insisted that she ''learn something to fall back on'' to support herself, so she took advertising courses at the Columbia University School of Business.         Back in Jackson in the early 1930's, Miss Welty wrote for a radio station and contributed society items to The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. During the Depression she got a publicity job at the Works Progress Administration, which enabled her to travel throughout Mississippi. She was troubled and fascinated by the people she saw and took hundreds of snapshots with a cheap camera, developing her prints in her kitchen at night. In 1971 Random House published a collection of these pictures, ''One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression.'' The book's stark, often grim black-and-white photographs revealed that Miss Welty's long-admired sense of observation was not limited to the ear.         ''I learned quickly enough when to click the shutter,'' she said later, ''but what I was becoming aware of more slowly was a story-writer's truth. The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it. In my own case, a fuller awareness of what I needed to find out about people and their lives had to be sought for through another way, through writing stories. I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''         The Depression pictures were exhibited in New York in 1936, the same year that Miss Welty, who had sent dozens of unsolicited stories to magazines, finally made her first sale. A small literary magazine called Manuscript accepted ''Death of a Traveling Salesman,'' the often anthologized recounting of the last day in the life of a lonely, ill and frightened shoe salesman who loses his way in rural Mississippi. Before he dies of a heart attack, he realizes fleetingly how little he has understood about himself and others.         It was the first of several stories published in small magazines. ''None of these publications paid, not really,'' Miss Welty recalled years later. ''Oh, I think The Southern Review was giving $25 a story, but it took two years before an agent could place one of my stories in a national magazine.''         Life at the P.O.         Miss Welty began to attract attention after The Atlantic Monthly published two of her stories destined to become classics: ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' and ''A Worn Path.'' The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office. The second won Miss Welty her first of six O. Henry Awards.         Early admirers of her short stories pressed Miss Welty to try her hand at a novel, but she resisted for several years. Her first hardcover book was a 1941 short-story collection, ''A Curtain of Green,'' with an introduction by Katherine Anne Porter, who had encouraged her early on. ''A Curtain of Green '' sold only 7,000 copies in 30 years, but the 17 stories in the collection became widely known and valued through their inclusion in many anthologies and college textbooks.         The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.' to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''         ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' combined Miss Welty's antic sense of humor with her pleasure in language. As the narrator prepares to leave her family's home, she says: ''So I hope to tell you I marched in and got the radio. And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot . . . The thermometer and the Hawaiian ukulele were certainly mine, and I stood on the stepladder and got all my watermelon-rind preserves and every fruit and vegetable I put up, every jar.''         An Internet Legacy         Many years later Eudora, the widely used e-mail program, was named after Miss Welty because its designer, Steven Dorner, said he had been processing so much e-mail that he felt like the Welty character who lived at the post office.         In 1941 Miss Welty followed ''A Curtain of Green'' with ''The Wide Net and Other Stories,'' and in 1942 she published ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' a novella that later became a successful musical in an adaptation by Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman. Her first full-length novel, ''Delta Wedding,'' appeared in 1946.         Three years later, a group of stories set in Morgana, an imaginary small town on the Mississippi Delta, was published under the title ''The Golden Apples.'' All of Miss Welty's gifts for compression, metaphorical language and poetic structure were on display. So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart. In the story ''The Whole World Knows,'' she charted a doomed meeting between a young couple who were estranged:         ''There in the flower beds walked the same robins. The sprinkler dripped now. Once again we went into the house by the back door. Our hands touched. We had stepped on Tellie's patch of mint. The yellow cat was waiting to go in with us, the door handle was as hot as the hand, and on the step, getting under the feet of two people who went in together, the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water -- ''Watch out for Mama's!'' -- a thousand times we had gone in like that. As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''         During World War II, Miss Welty was briefly on the staff of The New York Times Book Review and sometimes contributed reviews under the pseudonym Michael Ravenna. But she returned to Jackson during the 1950's, when her mother and brothers fell seriously ill. For almost 15 years, from the mid-50's to the late 60's, she published just a few short stories, some book reviews and a children's book, ''The Shoe Bird'' (1964). During this period she cared for her family and worked on two novels. Some writers speculated that she also suffered some spiritual ordeal or artistic crisis. After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''         Miss Welty's stories often reflected the fruits of her wide reading and special interests. ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.         In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.         Fiction of Family Life         That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life. They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.         Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders. Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she  demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager. This novel was adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and became a hit when it opened on Broadway in 1956.         Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place. We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way. We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations. We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''         And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?' ''         ''I didn't need their pointers to know that there was injustice among human beings or that there was trouble,'' she continued. ''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this. I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else. Whatever else makes them up interests me.''         Miss Welty made one notable exception to her rule against direct crusading when Medgar Evers, the black civil rights leader, was shot to death by a sniper in Jackson in 1963.         ''I did write a story the night it happened,'' she said. ''I was so upset about this, and I thought: I live down here where this happened and I believe I must know what a person like that felt like -- the murderer. There had been so many stories about such a character in the stock manner, written by people who didn't know the South, so I wrote about the murderer intimately -- in the first person, which was a very daring thing for me to do.''         In the Mind of an Assassin         The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested. Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath. Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.         Miss Welty never married. (Marriage, she said, ''never came up.'') She leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she was a shy person, she had many friends who were writers, among them Porter, Robert Penn Warren, Elizabeth Bowen, V. S. Pritchett, Cleanth Brooks, Shelby Foote, Walker Percy, Elizabeth Spencer, Ross MacDonald and Reynolds Price. She also had an enduring friendship with Diarmuid Russell, the agent who fiercely and devotedly represented her.         Her friends often spoke of her innate courtesy, which led her to seldom turn down requests for interviews. Those conversations usually took place at her home, and she often offered her interviewer bourbon and a home-cooked meal. She was warm and humorously self-deprecating.         One unlikely caller was Henry Miller. Miss Welty's mother, who had heard that Miller was a writer of obscene books, banned him from  their house. When Miss Welty did see him, she reported that he was ''the dullest man I ever saw in my life.''         ''He wasn't interested in anything outside himself,'' she said, ''that was the truth.''         In 1943, Faulkner wrote an unsolicited letter to Miss Welty after he had by chance read ''The Robber Bridegroom.''         ''You're doing all right,'' he said. That letter was hung near her wooden desk in an upstairs room in the Tudor-style house that her father built on Pinehurst Street in 1925, when she was 16.         ''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said. ''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''         Correction:  July 25, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the author Eudora Welty yesterday misstated the number of O. Henry Awards she received for short stories and misidentified the first of her stories to win one. The total was eight, not six. The first was for ''Petrified Man'' (1939); ''A Worn Path'' won in 1941.       
         Dr. Bernice L. Neugarten, an authority on aging who identified a growing trend among older people to pursue more active lives and introduced the concept of the young-old and the old-old, died on July 22 at her home in Chicago. She was 85.         When Dr. Neugarten began her research on aging at the University of Chicago in the 1940's, she discovered little scientific literature in the field, but many stereotypes, which she proceeded to shatter.         ''A set of stereotypes has grown up that older persons are sick, poor, enfeebled, isolated and desolated,'' she wrote much later, in 1975, in an article for The New York Times.         Arguing against such ideas, she pointed to a steadily declining retirement age and explained that people 55 and older were quitting work, once they were financially secure, to seek more healthful and more active lives. A new generation of older people, whom she called the young-old, could be distinguished from the middle-aged primarily by retirement and from the old-old by vigor and social involvement, she wrote.         Dr. Bertram Cohler, director of Chicago's psychology department, said: ''While much of her work focused on the second half of life, she viewed older lives in terms of both earlier life experiences and social context, which led to her interest in emphasizing that social policy must be based in terms of need, not age.  Her contributions were important in defining the study of adult lives.''         Dr. Neugarten's work showed that instead of retiring and stagnating, older people had become more likely to move from the suburbs back to the city in search of opportunities, self-enhancement and more education.         Older people should not be seen as the expendables of society but instead as the social contributors as well as the self-fulfilled, she wrote in The Times. ''They may become the first age group that on a large scale creates new service roles and gives service to the community without direct financial remuneration.''         In her later work, she wrote of an increasing antagonism toward older people for occupying ''a growing number of power positions,'' and she urged fellow social scientists to explore ways to avoid such resentment.         Dr. Neugarten completed her bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago in 1936 and received her doctorate there in 1943. Before joining the Chicago faculty in 1953, she took 10 years off to start a family.         Then the university asked her to teach a course on aging -- one of the first at the university level -- and to work on a study of middle-aged and older people in the Midwest. In 1958, she became director of Chicago's graduate training program in aging.         She wrote many papers and books about adult development and the relations between age groups, including the widely recognized ''Personality in Middle and Late Life,'' published in 1964.         In 1971, Dr. Neugarten was named to the Technical Committee on Research and Demonstration for the White House Conference on Aging. She was also a member of the National Advisory Council of the National Institute on Aging and helped organize the 1982 White House Conference on Aging.         She was an emeritus professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago's Center on Aging, Health and Society.         She received several awards from the American Psychological Association, including its annual Gold Medal Award for life contributions.         Her husband, Fritz Neugarten, died in 1990. She is survived by a brother, Jack Levin of Omaha; a daughter, Dail Neugarten of Denver; a son, Jerrold, of Hannacroix, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Yates, a writer whose books, many of them for children, were more than enough to fill a library shelf, died on Sunday at a hospice in Concord, N.H. A resident of Peterborough, N.H., she was 95.         Ms. Yates published her first book in 1938 and wrote more than 50 others into the mid-1990's. Many remain in print, including one that has taught young readers about black history in New England for half a century.         First published in 1950, ''Amos Fortune, Free Man'' traced the story of an adolescent African prince sold into slavery and brought to this country. Ms. Yates became aware of him when she happened upon his grave in a New Hampshire cemetery.         Intrigued by the inscription, she painstakingly researched his life and found how he, a complex man with a deep sense of honor, bought his freedom and built a home, a family and his own successful business as a skilled weaver and tanner. Like 25 other books by her, it was illustrated by her friend, the British artist Nora Unwin. It won the 1951 Newbery Medal and was translated into several foreign languages, as were some of her other books.         She also wrote an autobiographical trilogy and biographies of some strong-willed people. Among the latter was ''Prudence Crandall'' (Aladdin, 1955), about a teacher who defied Connecticut law in 1833 when she opened a private girls' school that accepted black and white pupils as equals.         Elizabeth Yates was born in Buffalo and went to school there and in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Living in Europe in the 1930's she started writing travel articles for American newspapers, including The Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times.         Back in this country she helped organize writers' conferences and lectured at Christian Writers and Editors Conferences in Green Lake, Wis.         She was active as an environmentalist. One of her books, ''The Road Through Sandwich Notch'' (Greene, 1972; reprinted 1984) helped to discourage development of that part of the White Mountains and to turn it into a national forest. She donated her Peterborough home, along with 45 acres of land, to the State of New Hampshire and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.         Her husband, William McGreal, died in 1963.       
         Diana Golden Brosnihan, who lost a leg to cancer at 12, won a gold medal in disabled skiing at the 1988 Calgary Olympics and played a key role in public appreciation of disabled athletes, died Saturday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. She was 38.         Her cancer returned in 1992 and again in 1997.         ''I like to live each day like an adventure,'' she once said.         She did that so well that Sports Illustrated once wrote that she was ''most likely to be remembered as the woman who, perhaps more than any other athlete, brought crossover credibility to the disabled sports movement.''         She was inducted into the Women's Sports Foundation International Hall of Fame in 1997. The citation read, ''She persuaded the ski world to treat all athletes the same, regardless of ability or, in her case, disability.'' She was also inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame that year.         Brosnihan, who grew up in Lincoln, Mass., outside Boston, learned to ski at 5. At 12, she developed bone cancer in her right leg, resulting in amputation above the knee. When she awakened after surgery, her first words were, ''Will I still be able to ski?'' Six months later, she was skiing.         As a high school sophomore, she discovered that she could jog on crutches. In her junior year, the high school ski coach asked her to join the team. She did, and a year later she won the downhill in the world handicapped championships.         ''If you had ever told me that I would make being an athlete my profession, I would have laughed at you, and my family would have laughed at you,'' she once said. ''It was not even a dream.'' But it became a reality. It also became an albatross, and from 1982 to 1985, she took two and a half years off from skiing.         ''It gave me time to find my identity apart from my skiing so that when I came back to skiing it was something I wanted to do for me and not because I needed that image from other people,'' she said.         She used one ski and two outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips attached). Later, never using an artificial leg, she abandoned the outriggers in favor of regular ski poles so she could go faster.         She rejoined the national disabled team and persuaded potential corporate sponsors to support the team as they would any other. She persuaded the United States Ski Association to allow disabled skiers to compete in national championships against able-bodied skiers.         That open-competition policy became known as the Golden Rule, and she took advantage of it. She might finish last, 20 seconds behind a renowned skier like Tamara McKinney, but said she would come closer next time. She often did.         Against other disabled skiers, her success was overwhelming. From 1986 to 1990, she won 10 world and 19 United States championships. In the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, when disabled skiing was a demonstration sport, she won the gold medal in the giant slalom. The United States Olympic Committee voted her the female skier of the year, ahead of able-bodied skiers.         In 1991, the Women's Sports Foundation gave her the Flo Hyman award, which had previously gone to Martina Navratilova, Evelyn Ashford, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Chris Evert.         That year, she retired (for the last time) from competition and took up rock climbing and mountaineering. Then the cancer returned, leading to bilateral mastectomies, the loss of her uterus and an attempted suicide. Again, she turned herself around, climbed Mount Rainier and continued as a motivational speaker.         In 1997, the cancer returned again and spread to her spine, pelvis and lungs. She stopped giving motivational speeches, saying she could not be upbeat anymore and could not force a smile.         At Dartmouth, where she received a degree in English literature in 1984, she casually met Steve Brosnihan, who became a freelance cartoonist for New England newspapers. They met again in 1996 and were married in August 1997 between her chemotherapy sessions.         She is survived by her husband, of Bristol, R.I., her mother, a brother and a sister.         To the end, Brosnihan fought for dignified treatment and perceptions of the disabled. ''You think about women,'' she said, ''and people used to pat us on the back and say: 'Isn't that sweet? She's competing.' Now they don't do that anymore. It's the same with the disabled. People treat us with dignity.         ''To me it has to do with the dignity of each person. Each person is worthy of respect, so it's a matter of if I choose to live with that dignity myself.         ''Sometimes, stereotypes make me laugh. Like when people introduce you as courageous. Often, I've heard it on television, 'We're talking with a girl today who had cancer when she was 12, beat the odds and now she skis.' I say: 'Now wait a minute. I don't just ski. I'm the best in the world and I train my heart and soul out for this and I ski 150 days and I work out in the weight room, and to me courageous doesn't imply any of that.'         ''Athletes don't want to be courageous. They want to be good.''         In 1988, she skied on screen for three minutes in a feature-length movie, ''Escape to Ski.'' Warren Miller, who made the film, became an instant fan.         ''After you're with her for a few minutes, you totally forget her handicap,'' he said. ''She has her act together, and it's not an act.''       
         Elizabeth Bliss Parkinson Cobb, a vital and effective presence at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for nearly 70 years, died on Aug. 24 in Hightstown, N.J. She was 93 and lived in Hightstown.         Best known as Eliza Parkinson, Ms. Cobb was a niece of Lillie Bliss, one of the museum's founders, and a stepdaughter of the museum's first president, A. Conger Goodyear.         After being invited in her early 20's by Nelson Rockefeller to be a member of the museum's fledgling Junior Advisory Committee, she soon began to seek out and enlist energetic young people, many of whom were to be part of a new generation of informed and active supporters of the museum.         Agnes Gund, president of the museum, said on Monday, ''Though she was not herself able to collect on the scale of either her aunt or her stepfather, she came to feel so deeply for the museum's collections in all their variety that she regarded every one of them as her own.''         Each aspect of the museum's encyclopedic activity fascinated her. She also took pride in adventurous outposts, like the Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center in Hamlin, Pa., which saves the Modern's movie collection from decay.         In 1939, Eliza Parkinson was appointed a trustee of the museum. Thereafter, except for service with the Red Cross during World War II, she served on the board uninterruptedly. She was president of the museum from 1965 to 1968, was vice-chairwoman from 1968 to 1993, and was named a life trustee in 1993.         As chairwoman of the building committee from 1968 to 1977, she was instrumental in decisions on how to expand the premises. ''Eliza cared so strongly for the history and for the memory of the museum,'' Ms. Gund said, ''that she could not bear to think of its being divided into two separate branches in New York. She loved every stone in those buildings and every leaf in its garden.''         Eliza Parkinson was also a prime mover in the museum's international council, which in effect gave the museum worldwide status. She was credited with an almost ambassadorial gift for diplomacy. Chairwoman of the council's membership committee in its early days, she later served as its vice chairwoman and, from 1957 to 1966, as its president. Those were the years in which postwar American painting first came to widespread international notice.         They were also the years in which the museum came to be ranked as the father and grandfather of modern-art museums the world over. Had it not been for the pivotal shows the Modern sent to Australia, Ms. Gund said, Jackson Pollock's ''Blue Poles'' might not be in the National Gallery in Canberra today.         Ms. Cobb's first husband, John Parkinson Jr., died in 1973. Her second husband, Henry Ives Cobb, died in 1999.         She is survived by a son, John Parkinson III, who was appointed a trustee of the museum in 1976 and is its treasurer; a daughter, the pianist Zaidee Parkinson; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dame Dorothy Tutin, one of the most versatile and admired of British actresses, died on Monday in London, where she lived. She was 71.         She had been suffering from leukemia, said her agent, Michael Whitehall.         During her long and rich career, Ms. Tutin played almost all of Shakespeare's leading female roles, from Ophelia and Juliet to Portia and Lady Macbeth. She also did a full range of plays by Chekhov, Ibsen and Strindberg, played Sally Bowles in the London production of ''I Am a Camera,'' and acted in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter.         In her roles, she projected a quiet elegance, whether she was playing queens, which she often did, or commoners. Although she was petite (5 foot 3), she could be majestic, a commanding presence with a distinctive mellifluous voice. For her performances, she won a mantel-full of awards. Last year she was made a dame, joining Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and other actresses of equal stature.         Her theatrical breakthrough came in 1953 when she played the painfully neurotic wife in Graham Greene's first play, ''The Living Room.'' Writing about her, Kenneth Tynan said ''Miss Tutin's performance is masterly: the very nakedness of acting. In her greatest sorrow she blazes like a diamond in a mine.'' On various stages -- at the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal Court, the National Theater and on the West End -- she continued to blaze for the rest of the 20th century.         She was born in London. As a young woman, she studied music, but was unsure about a career until her father suggested that she apply to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although she failed her first audition, she was soon accepted. After making her professional debut in ''The Thistle and the Rose'' in 1949, she joined the Bristol Old Vic. Her work at the Old Vic in London led to her first movie role as Cecily opposite Michael Redgrave in the 1952 film of ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''         Although she later played Polly Peachum in Laurence Olivier's film of ''The Beggar's Opera'' and was in ''The Shooting Party'' with James Mason and John Gielgud, most of her acting was in the theater.         In the 1950's, after ''The Living Room,'' she played, among other roles, Sally Bowles, Joan of Arc in ''The Lark,'' Archie Rice's daughter (opposite Olivier) in ''The Entertainer,'' and a panoply of Shakespearean characters at Stratford-on-Avon. An actress of unquenchable modesty, she once said, ''Shakespeare is so rich and complex that you know perfectly well you can never do it well enough . . . but it's good to play something beyond you in every way.''         In 1963 she came to Broadway in the Shakespeare anthology ''The Hollow Crown.'' Two years later she scored a London success as Queen Victoria in ''Portrait of a Queen.'' In 1968 she and her husband Derek Waring (as Prince Albert) brought the play to Broadway.         She is survived by her husband, their daughter, Amanda, and son,  Nicholas, both of whom are actors.         Frequently, she diversified her career by undertaking contemporary roles, in 1971 playing the wife in the original London production of Harold Pinter's ''Old Times.'' Reviewing the play, Harold Clurman said that all three actors, Vivien Merchant, Ms. Tutin and Colin Blakely ''not only express the play but seem to contain it in its incisiveness, its own kind of elegance and its brilliant mystery.''         Later she acted in a revival of ''A Kind of Alaska'' by Mr. Pinter and in the premiere production of his ''Party Time.'' She also starred opposite John Wood in Tom Stoppard's adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ''Undiscovered Country'' at Britain's National Theater. In 1989 she played the actress Desiree in a revival of ''A Little Night Music.''         Throughout her life, she remained devoted to the stage. Explaining that commitment and her desire to be challenged, she said, ''The marvelous thing about the theater is that it happens that night and it dies every night with you and the next morning it's all to be done again. I hate anything permanent.''       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin.         As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In ''Running Time: Films of the Cold War'' (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's.         In her next book, ''Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's'' (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. ''The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition,'' she wrote, ''but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted.''         Reviewing ''Previous Convictions,'' David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as ''an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments'' and whose ''natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness.'' He continued, ''Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology.''         Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote ''Annie Oakley'' (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on ''Gunga Din'' (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.         ''Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all,'' she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. ''I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics.''         In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to ''blotting out,'' she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.         It was in England that she became more politically aware -- ''they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do,'' she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was ''somewhat of a lefty.'' As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, ''On the Wing: A Young American Abroad'' (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.         Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in ''On the Wing,'' ''He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own'' and ''instilling a horror of clichés.''         She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. ''I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile,'' she told Mr. Close, ''but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then.'' Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.         Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled ''Sixties Going on Seventies'' (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions  -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.         She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. ''I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all,'' she told Mr. Close. ''I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist.'' She added: ''Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' ''         In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.         Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- ''like Richard Nixon,'' she told Mr. Close. ''It isn't all writing,'' she explained. ''Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way.''         She described herself to Mr. Close as ''of a certain age.'' She added: ''It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things.''       
         Gale Cincotta, a plainspoken mother of six who became a neighborhood activist and went on to help ignite the national debate over bank lending policies that discriminated against minority home buyers, died Wednesday at a hospital in Maywood, Ill. She was 72.         The cause was gall bladder cancer, said Tracy Van Slyke, spokeswoman for the National Training and Information Center, of which Ms. Cincotta was executive director.         Ms. Cincotta, who lived in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, achieved fame for her spirited fights for residents of the neighborhood of Austin, on Chicago's West Side, where she lived most of her life. In a 1996 article in Illinois Issues, she told of nailing a rat to the door of the alderman for  Austin in 1970 after he refused to attack rodents. The next day, the city's rat patrol was on the job.         She moved on to national issues, especially her challenge to the banking industry and the federal bureaucracy over the practice called redlining, refusing to lend to residents of minority neighborhoods. As part of this fight, she once threatened to nail a ''Loan Shark'' sign over the door of the Federal Reserve in Washington.         After redlining was outlawed in the 1970's, she kept fighting to make sure the law was enforced.         Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said she ''was instrumental in helping the city formulate its campaign against predatory lending.''         Last year, she successfully lobbied for a Chicago ordinance to ban such lending practices, like offering very high mortgage rates and other confiscatory financial terms to minority members and the poor, often resulting in the loss of homes through foreclosures. In April, the Illinois Legislature followed suit.         Gail Angeles was born on Dec. 28, 1929, in Chicago. Her father ran a Greek restaurant. She married a gas station owner and they had six sons. She became politically active in the 1960's because of school crowding.         In the late 1960's, Ms. Cincotta became president of the Organization for a Better Austin. The school battle expanded into other concerns, as Ms. Cincotta fought real estate agents' encouragement of panic selling by white homeowners as minorities began looking for homes.         People in other cities began turning to Ms. Cincotta and her colleagues for advice, and she became head of National People's Action, a network of 30 groups from 110 cities. The umbrella group held a housing conference in Chicago in 1972 and a protest in Baltimore the next year.         The strategy was extended to other issues, including consumer protection. ''Coalitions are forming all over the place,'' Ms. Cincotta said in an interview with The New York Times in 1982.         Her group was one of those that successfully pressed Congress to pass the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires lending institutions to disclose where they make home loans. It also was an advocate in the winning fight to persuade Congress to pass the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which required banks to invest in neighborhoods where they did business.         National People's Action combined with other neighborhood groups to persuade three large Chicago banks to commit themselves to making $173 million in low-interest loans for housing and industrial development in poor neighborhoods. In return, the groups agreed not to challenge the banks' merger plans.         Colleagues remembered her war cry: ''We want it. They've got it. Let's go get it.''         Ms. Cincotta is survived by five sons, George and Charles of Delray Beach, Fla.; James of Ottawa, Canada; Theodore of Phoenix and Richard of Oak Park, Ill., eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.  No information was available on the sixth son.       
         Lynn Payer, a science writer and medical journalist best known for her books about the impact of culture on medical care, died Saturday at Calvary Hospice in the Bronx. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her sister, Cheryl Payer, her only immediate relative.         Ms. Payer's critically praised book, ''Medicine and Culture: Varieties of Treatment in the United States, England, West Germany and France,'' was first published by Holt in 1988. A 1995 paperback edition is still in print.         The book grew from her work as a reporter in Europe writing on health and medical matters. The countries she studied have similar mortality rates but significant differences in medical practice.         Medical care, she found, is strongly influenced by cultural norms and values ingrained over hundreds of years. The differences can show up in the types and quantities of drugs doctors prescribe, the kinds and numbers of operations performed, even what blood pressure levels are thought to require treatment.         Lynn Payer was born in El Dorado, Kan., and discovered her interest in science on nature walks and at summer science camps of the National Science Foundation. She studied comparative biochemistry and physiology at the University of Kansas, graduating in 1967, and got her master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1969.         She was a reporter for Medical Tribune in New York, but she soon quit and spent eight years in Paris in the 1970's before returning to New York in 1979 as a freelance writer.         At her death, she was managing editor of Medical Encounter, the quarterly newsletter of the American Academy on Physician and Patient.         She contributed to a book, ''Questions Patients Most Often Ask Their Doctors'' (Bantam, 1983), and was the author of ''How to Avoid a Hysterectomy'' (Pantheon, 1987). She also wrote ''Disease Mongers: How Doctors, Drug Companies, and Insurers are Making You Feel Sick'' (Reed, 1992).       
         Sallie M. Wheeler, an Anheuser-Busch heiress who led a successful campaign to return the nation's oldest and most prestigious horse show to Manhattan, died on Friday at her home in Keswick, Va. She was 70.         Mrs. Wheeler, a lifelong equestrian, led efforts to return the National Horse Show to Madison Square Garden after it moved to the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1989. With its audience full of black ties and evening gowns, the show had been a highlight of the high society calendar. But, facing financial burdens, it began to lose its luster in the 1980's.         The show, a Manhattan mainstay since 1883, relocated to the Meadowlands amid rumors of impending bankruptcy. In New Jersey, the show increased in size and eliminated its debt but began to lose what Mrs. Wheeler saw as its greatest asset: its prestige.         Mrs. Wheeler believed the National Horse Show was synonymous with its original location, Madison Square Garden. Throughout the show's history, and even during its seven years at the Meadowlands, fans referred to the show as simply the Garden. The horse show is among four events that have been held at the four different Madison Square Garden buildings. Mrs. Wheeler contributed her time and fortune to make sure it went back there.         With much fanfare, the show returned to the Garden in 1996. To herald its homecoming, Mrs. Wheeler arranged for Seventh Avenue to be shut for a parade of Budweiser Clydesdales.         The heyday of the show was over, however. What was once a weeklong event was condensed into four days and eventually into two and a half. And its stature in the New York social scene was only partly restored.         Mrs. Wheeler's love of horses stemmed from her childhood. She was born Sallie Marie Busch on Aug. 22, 1931, in St. Louis to Catherine Milliken Busch and Adolphus Busch III, who became president of Anheuser-Busch in 1934.         Mr. Busch and his brother, August A. Busch Jr., were partners at the brewery and were accomplished horsemen. As a child growing up on Grant's Farm, once the home of Ulysses S. Grant, Sallie rode horses, and when her father died in 1946, August Busch helped rear her. She began to ride competitively, and at 15, she made her first National Horse Show appearance.         Supported by her stake in the family company, Sallie made a living of her love of horses. In 1965, she married Kenneth M. Wheeler, a professional horse trainer. During their more than 35 years of marriage, they raised and trained hundreds of champion horses at their farm in Keswick and participated in equestrian shows around the country.         Among the most prominent and successful exhibitors in the horse world, the Wheelers won thousands of blue ribbons, an average of 200 to 300 each year. In 1987, the American Horse Shows Association named Mrs. Wheeler its horsewoman of the year. In 1999, the organization gave the Wheelers its lifetime achievement award.         Upon receiving that award, Mrs. Wheeler said: ''It is rare that two people have so fully enjoyed a career in a profession and a hobby in a sport such as Kenny and I have been privileged to. We both realize that none of this would be possible without the fabulous animals we do dearly love and appreciate.''         Mrs. Wheeler's first marriage, to Robert Motch, ended with his death.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Wheeler is survived by five children, Sallie M. Motch of Cold Spring, N.Y., Robert Motch of Carthage, Mo., Kenneth M. Wheeler Jr. of Memphis, Gordon L. Wheeler of Harrodsburg, Ky., and Douglas B. Wheeler of Keswick, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Pauline Kael, who expressed her passion for movies in jaunty, jazzy prose as the longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died yesterday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 82.         Ms. Kael was probably the most influential film critic of her time. She reviewed movies for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1979, and again, after working briefly in the film industry, from 1980 until 1991. Earlier, she was a film critic for Life magazine in 1965, for McCall's in 1965 and 1966 and for The New Republic in 1966 and 1967.         Enchanting her fans and infuriating her foes, rarely dull and often sharp and funny, with an intellectualism that reflected her background as a student of philosophy, Ms. Kael was never anything but outspoken.         Whether dismissing auteur theory, reviewing Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' (1975) before it was finished, questioning the extent of Orson Welles's contribution to ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) or proclaiming Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' (1973) as a cultural event comparable to the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Ms. Kael was always provocative. Her seductive writing style bred a legion of acolytes, known as Paulettes.         The critic Louis Menand wrote in The New York Review of Books in March 1995: ''Kael was the most brilliantly ad hoc critic of her time, and she made it possible to care about movies without feeling pompous or giddy by showing that what comes first in everyone's experience of a movie isn't the form or the idea but the sensation, and that this is just as true for moviegoers who have been taught to intellectualize their responses to art as it is for everyone else.''         By the time she retired, Mr. Menand observed, she had produced a generation of inferior imitators. ''The manner of appreciation she invented has become the standard manner of popular culture criticism in America,'' he wrote.         Assessing her impact in a 1998 interview, Ms. Kael said: ''I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They've rarely agreed with me about movies.''         At the same time, she deflected the question of whether her criticism had had any effect on films and filmmakers. ''I'd rather not say,'' she answered. ''If I say yes, I'm an egotist, and if I say no, I've wasted my life. Although I've been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy.''         Overpraising or overdamning was Ms. Kael's way, and she left no doubt about her favorites: actors like Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, John Travolta, Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, and actresses like Joan Cusack, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver and Debra Winger.         She championed films of the 1970's, like Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' (1972) and ''Godfather, Part II'' (1974); Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' (1973) and ''Taxi Driver'' (1976); Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo'' (1975); and Mr. Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971) and ''M*A*S*H'' (1970). She also liked the sensual violence of directors like Sam Peckinpah, whose films included ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and ''Straw Dogs'' (1971), and Brian De Palma, whose works include ''Carrie'' (1976) and ''Casualties of War'' (1989).         ''You know, they talk about the golden age of the cinema as if it took place in the late 30's or in the 40's,'' she said in 1989. ''There was nothing personal and exciting in most of those movies. They were machine tooled. They were a lot of fun. But except for Preston Sturges and a few flukey individualists, they just didn't have the personal voice of the movies of the 70's.''         As a writer whose heyday spanned the years from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) to ''Awakenings'' (1990), ''Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ''L.A. Story'' (1991), Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.         In a 1968 review in The New York Times of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,'' a collection of Ms. Kael's reviews and articles, Eliot Fremont-Smith called her ''the most quotable critic writing; but what is important and bracing is that she relates movies to other experiences, to ideas and attitudes, to ambition, books, money, other movies, to politics and the evolving culture, to moods of the audience, to our sense of ourselves -- to what movies do to us, the acute and self-scrutinizing awareness of which is always at the core of her judgment.''         Reviewing ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) in treacle-curdling prose that reportedly prompted McCall's to dismiss her, Ms. Kael asked, ''Wasn't there perhaps one little Von Trapp who didn't want to sing his head off or who screamed that he wouldn't act out little glockenspiel routines for Papa's party guests, or who got nervous and threw up if he had to get out on a stage?''         Writing about Kevin Costner in ''Dances With Wolves'' (1990), she said he had ''feathers in his hair and feathers in his head.'' Writing about Robert De Niro in ''Awakenings,'' she said, ''It's in the quiet moments that he's particularly bad.'' She also said that that film contained ''another of Robin Williams's benevolent-eunuch roles.''         At her peak, she lauded popular movies like Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' (1975) and Philip Kaufman's ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978) and became more of a supporter of the auteur theory. But in time, Ms. Kael, who attracted notice early in her career by attacking critics like Bosley Crowther of The Times and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, came under fire for predictability and dogmatism.         It was inevitable that she should be the object of criticism herself. George Lucas named the villainous General Kael in ''Willow'' (1988) for her, and in a celebrated onslaught in The New York Review of Books in 1980, the writer Renata Adler declared Ms. Kael's work ''piece by piece, line by line, without interruption, worthless.''         Ms. Adler, a former film critic for The Times, wrote that Ms. Kael's recent work ''falls somewhere between huckster copy and ideological pamphleteering,'' and that ''mistaking lack of civility for vitality, she substitutes for argument a protracted, obsessional invective.''         Assessing her own work, Ms. Kael said: ''I try not to be rough on small films. Generally, when I'm really rough, it's on something that I know is going to be a big hit, and that everybody is going to go for it, and I think it's an atrocity -- that's fair game. I'm interested in discovering talent, and in trying to explain why I think someone is talented. I'm more interested in that than I am in panning.''         Over the years, Ms. Kael's reviews and essays were assembled in a series of books whose double-entendre titles suggested the intimacy of her love affair with movies (she preferred the word ''movies'' to ''film'' or ''cinema''). Among them were ''I Lost It at the Movies'' (1965); ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (1968); ''Going Steady'' (1970); ''Deeper Into Movies'' (1973), a 1974 National Book Award winner; ''Reeling'' (1976); ''When the Lights Go Down'' (1980); ''Hooked'' (1989); ''Movie Love'' (1991); and ''For Keeps'' (1994).         When the last was published, she said in the introduction: ''I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have.''         Central to her approach to criticism was her belief that the popular appeal of movies was rooted in trash. In her essay ''Trash, Art and the Movies,'' reprinted in ''Going Steady,'' Ms. Kael wrote: ''Movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip -- from what was coarse and common.''         She went on to say: ''If we've grown up at the movies, we know that good work is not continuous with the academic, respectable tradition but with glimpses of something good in trash, but we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain of discovery. Trash has given us an appetite for art.''         Ms. Kael's appetite for the movies began in childhood. The fifth child and third daughter of immigrants from Poland, Isaac Paul Kael and the former Judith Friedman, she was born in Petaluma, Calif., on June 19, 1919. She described her father as a gentleman farmer and a moviegoer, and her own trips to see films began early.         Among the favorites she recalled were comedies in the late 1920's that starred Bebe Daniels as a wisecracking flapper; ''Million Dollar Legs'' (1932), with W. C. Fields; and the Marx Brothers's ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933).         For a time the Kaels lived on their Sonoma County farm, which they lost in the Depression. Ms. Kael was 8 when her family moved to San Francisco.         ''A bookish girl from a bookish family'' is the way she once described herself. Blue-eyed, brown-haired, five feet tall and weighing a bit more than 100 pounds, she said: ''I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at 'Kentucky Moonshine,' a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to a movie again.''         In 1936 she enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in philosophy. Despite expectations that she would proceed to law school or teaching, she went to New York with a friend, the poet Robert Horan, for about three years.         When she returned to the Bay Area, she led a bohemian life, tried her hand at writing plays and helped make experimental films. Married and divorced three times, she supported herself and her daughter, Gina James, by writing advertising copy, clerking in a bookstore and working as a cook, a seamstress and a textbook writer.         Ms. Kael never wrote movie criticism until she was 35 and, she said, ''I never made a living at this until I was in my 40's.'' Her career at The New Yorker did not begin until she was nearly 50.         The turning point in her life came, as in a Hollywood script, when she was discovered in a coffee shop in the Bay Area in 1953. She was arguing about a movie with a friend when the editor of City Lights magazine asked them each to review Chaplin's ''Limelight.'' The friend turned in nothing. Ms. Kael's review called the film ''slimelight,'' and a career was born.         Soon Ms. Kael was being published in magazines like Sight and Sound and Partisan Review, and her provocative criticism was being broadcast weekly on KPFA, Berkeley's listener-supported radio station. The radio criticism led to an offer to manage an art theater, which she turned into a two-screen house, the Berkeley Cinema Guild Theaters.         ''I made the displays, wrote the program and cleaned the chewing gum off the seats,'' she said. She revived W. C. Fields, Mae West and Busby Berkeley films and Welles's ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) and showed Ingmar Bergman films before they became staples of art houses elsewhere. ''It was exciting turning up things and drawing an audience to see them,'' she said.         The feisty, funny reviews that she wrote for the programs enhanced her reputation, and she began lecturing on film at universities in San Francisco and Los Angeles.         She was 46 when her essays in Partisan Review led to an offer to publish her first book, ''I Lost It at the Movies,'' a collection of her articles and broadcasts, which became a best seller. In it she praised movies like Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (1937), Vittorio de Sica's ''Shoeshine'' (1946) and Martin Ritt's ''Hud'' (1963). She attacked other critics, poked fun at materialistic movie magnates and derided the pretensions of Alain Resnais's ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), calling it ''the snow job in the ice palace.''         Assignments from magazines began to flow in, and in 1965, Ms. Kael, her daughter and Ms. Kael's two basenjis (dogs that, interestingly, cannot bark) moved to New York.         In 1968, in response to an offer from  William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, who was willing to let her write whatever she wanted and at length, Ms. Kael began to review movies for the magazine. Until 1979, she reviewed weekly from September through March, and Penelope Gilliatt reviewed for the other half of the year.         Ms. Kael's first review for The New Yorker was virtually the only rave that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' received in New York, but it compelled other critics to reconsider their assessments.         At 59, Ms. Kael left The New Yorker for Hollywood. She briefly worked as a production executive for Warren Beatty. After that job ended over what were described as ''artistic differences,'' Paramount Pictures put her under contract as a consultant and scout for several months before she returned to The New Yorker in 1980.         Ms. Gilliatt had departed, and Ms. Kael began writing every two weeks, commuting to New York from a Victorian home on four and a half acres in Massachusetts that she bought for $37,000 in 1970. In New York, she stayed in a hotel for four days and saw two movies nightly. Back home at night, she wrote. Her daughter, an artist, lived nearby with her family.         She is survived by her daughter, Ms. James, of Great Barrington, and a grandson, William Friedman, also of Great Barrington, and two sisters, Anne Wallach and Rose Makower, both of Berkeley.         Ms. Kael was reputed never to see a film more than once, yet she seemed to remember everything, from lighting and costumes to writing, sound, direction and performances.         In 1991, at 71, after 22 years at The New Yorker, Ms. Kael retired from regular reviewing.         Looking back on her impassioned love affair with movies, she once said, ''I was a film critic the way somebody might write poetry, for fun or love.''       
         Doris Howes Calloway, a nutritionist whose studies helped set standards for the dietary needs of people, died Aug. 31 at a nursing home in Seattle. She was 78.         Dr. Calloway had Parkinson's disease, said the University of California at Berkeley, where she was a professor and a provost emeritus.         In her 27 years at Berkeley, Dr. Calloway earned international renown as a scientist. She also was the first woman to enter the ranks of the university's top administrators, becoming provost of its 13 professional schools and colleges in 1981.         Her work nearly 40 years ago influenced dietary research. Especially influential were her classic Penthouse studies, begun in 1963. They recorded in detail the food and energy needs of six volunteers who lived in isolation for weeks in a campus apartment, known as the Penthouse. Among Dr. Calloway's conclusions was that Americans did not need as much protein as had been thought. The body uses only so much and eliminates the rest, she found.         She also studied the special nutritional requirements of women during menstruation and pregnancy, as well as the needs of the elderly and other groups.         The Penthouse studies continued  until 1981 and influenced national norms for recommended daily allowances of nutrients. They were directed by Dr. Calloway with Dr. Sheldon Margen, now an emeritus professor of public health.         The university created a laboratory for them on the fourth floor of Morgan Hall. There, six volunteers at a time lived in a three-bedroom apartment for up to three months on a minutely monitored diet.         They were allowed out for exercise under strict supervision. Every particle of protein that went into and out of their bodies was tracked, including in sweat and tears and hair and skin loss.         In the late 1980's, during and after her tenure as a provost, Dr. Calloway led a nine-university research project in Kenya, Egypt and Mexico to measure the causes and effects of moderate malnutrition. Besides assessing its consequences, the study identified the poor education and low status of women as being among its causes.         Born Doris Howes in Canton, Ohio, she graduated from Ohio State University in 1943. She received her Ph.D. in nutrition at the University of Chicago in 1947.         Her career started at the Quartermaster Food and Container Institute of the Armed Forces, in Chicago, where she worked until 1961 and became chief of the nutrition branch.         After a job at the Stanford Research Institute, she was appointed a professor of nutrition at Berkeley in 1963. She formally retired in 1990 but continued her work until her health failed well into the 1990's.         Dr. Calloway is survived by her husband of 20 years, Robert Nesheim of Seattle; a son, David, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; a daughter, Candace Calloway Whiting of Seattle; two stepdaughters, Sandra Rankin of Danbury, Conn., and Barbara Mowry of Denver; and nine grandchildren. Her first marriage, to Nathaniel O. Calloway, ended in divorce.         One of the many honors Dr. Calloway received came from the Quartermaster Institute in Chicago, which named her Man of the Year in 1959. She displayed the plaque prominently in her office and delighted in drawing attention to it.       
         Barbara K. Olson, who was killed on Tuesday on the commercial jetliner that was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon, was well known to television viewers across the nation as a combative and confident political commentator representing the conservative Republican point of view.         Mrs. Olson, 45, was also half of a highly influential couple on Washington's social-political scene; her husband, Theodore B. Olson, an appellate lawyer, successfully argued the Florida election case for George W. Bush before the Supreme Court. President Bush named Mr. Olson the nation's solicitor general, the official who formulates the administration's strategy before the nation's courts.         Mr. Olson was in his Justice Department office on Tuesday morning when he received two calls from Mrs. Olson, who was using her cell phone aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to tell him the plane had been hijacked. Her description of what was occurring in her last moments provided what officials said was valuable information about the incident. She reported that the flight crew had been herded to the back of the plane with the passengers, and she asked her husband what she should tell the pilot who was apparently beside her while the hijackers were in control of the cockpit.         Mrs. Olson's friends and her husband said her efforts to ''do something'' on the doomed plane were exquisitely in character. ''She never sat back,'' her husband said in an interview.         The Olsons, who were married four years ago, complemented each other in style. Mrs. Olson was the more outspoken of the two in her televised commentaries, while Mr. Olson presented a more deliberative face in his role as the reigning constitutional litigator for the Republican establishment.         Although Mrs. Olson was generally a take-no-prisoners advocate, Mr. Olson recalled on Tuesday that she recently told him she had come to believe that the national political debate had become too acrimonious. He recalled that she said that during one television appearance, she believed those who called in comments to her and her liberal counterpart, Bill Press, were far too harsh.         Barbara Kay Bracher Olson was born on Dec. 27, 1955, in Houston, and trained to be a teacher at the University of St. Thomas in her hometown. But, she had told friends, she wanted to save enough money to go to law school and decided a quicker way to do so than teaching was to become a part of the film industry.         With no experience in the field but  an abundance of self-confidence, she moved to Hollywood and began telephoning production companies connected to well-known actors, offering herself as an all-around helper. Stacy Keach finally offered her a job, Mr. Olson recalled this week, and when she saved enough money to go to law school, she moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Olson turned down jobs in New York after law school because she yearned to live in Washington. As chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Republican majority from  1995 to 1996, Mrs. Olson led the investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in firing longtime employees of the White House travel office. She became a caustic and relentless critic of the Clintons.         Mrs. Olson wrote ''Hell to Pay'' (Regnery, 1999), a highly critical book about Mrs. Clinton, and recently finished a sequel, ''Final Days,'' about the Clintons' last weeks in the White House. Mr. Olson said it would be published by Regnery.         Mrs. Olson is survived by her brother, David Bracher, and her sister, Antoinette Lawrence, both of Houston, as well as her husband.       
         Lisa J. Raines, one of the earliest and most prominent lobbyists for the biotechnology industry, died on Tuesday in the crash of the hijacked airplane that hit the Pentagon. She was 42 and lived in Great Falls, Va.         Ms. Raines was senior vice president for government relations at the Genzyme Corporation, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass. She was flying from Washington to Los Angeles aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to attend a company sales meeting in Palm Springs, Calif.         Ms. Raines played a role in shaping virtually all of the laws affecting the biotechnology industry over more than a decade, including laws that strengthened patent protection and accelerated the approval of drugs by the Food and Drug Administration.         Henri A. Termeer, the chief executive of Genzyme, said that when the F.D.A. Modernization Act of 1997 was signed into law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of of Massachusetts, gave the pen he received from President Bill Clinton to Ms. Raines for her role in pushing for the law, which streamlined the drug approval process.         Ms. Raines sometimes was at odds with people who complained that drug prices were too high. Genzyme charges more than $150,000 a year for its drug for Gaucher disease, a rare inherited disorder. But Ms. Raines always argued that the high price was necessary to encourage innovation and bring new treatments to market.         ''Ninety percent of the time we were on the opposite sides, but you had to have the utmost respect for her,'' said Abbey Meyers, president of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an advocacy group for people with rare diseases.         Many who knew her said Ms. Raines was persuasive, whether on Capitol Hill or around the family dinner table. ''When she was convinced of something she would argue you into the ground,'' Ms. Meyers said. ''I could imagine her on that plane,'' she added, referring to the hijacked airline. ''She isn't the type who would have sat in her seat.''         Ms. Raines is survived by her husband, Stephen Push, a former vice president for corporate communications at Genzyme; her father, Arthur Raines of Lovettsville, Va.; her mother, Marilyn Raines of Boynton Beach, Fla.; and a brother, Douglas Raines, of Wayland, Mass.       
         Kay Teer Crawford, whose sympathy for high school girls who did not make the cheerleading squad in her Texas hometown led her to start one of the first of the drill teams, died on Aug. 29 at her home in Redondo Beach, Calif. She was 88.         Her son Kim said the reason earlier reports of her death listed her as 83 was that she had lopped five years off her age when she was 75 to increase her employment opportunities. Almost until her death, she actively promoted drill teams not just as entertainment but as a sport.         Mrs. Crawford, a cheerleader herself, came up with the concept of having sequined young women prancing about at sporting events around the time Gussie Nell Davis had the same idea with her Flaming Flashes in Greenville, Tex. Miss Davis went on to form the celebrated Kilgore Rangerettes of Kilgore College in Kilgore, Tex.         A Kilgore College history reports that Miss Davis began the Greenville troupe in 1928, two years before Mrs. Crawford started the Sergeanettes at Edinburg High School in Edinburg, Tex. But Janet Mar, Mrs. Crawford's personal assistant, insists that her boss was first with the inimitable combination of high-spirited marching, dancing and kicking that became an American tradition.         Whatever the chronology, Mrs. Crawford's contribution to the world of drill teams looms large. She brought the idea from Texas to Southern California, where she spent many years adding show-business glamour to plain old Texas strutting. She provided drill teams for 10 Super Bowls, 4 Rose Bowls and 7 Pro Bowls, and at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she put 1,268 drill team members through their lively paces.         Two years later, at the rededication of the Statue of Liberty, she fielded a team almost that large, including all-stars from every state. The next year, she helped orchestrate a celebration surrounding a mass by Pope John Paul II at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.         David Wolper, who produced the Olympic and Statue of Liberty shows, said: ''Kay recruited, trained and prepared thousands of young drill team girls for the events, and when Kay trained them, they were perfect. We have lost a real champion.''         Kay Waweehie Teer, whose mother was half-Cherokee and half-Comanche, was born on a farm near Granger, Tex., on Aug. 16, 1914. Her father moved off the farm to become the sheriff of Hidalgo County, Tex., where he made his wife and only child deputies so they could travel with him over the vast territory on official business.         He died shortly after moving to Edinburg to take a different law enforcement job. Mrs. Crawford and her mother then squatted in a succession of vacant houses, stealing from gardens to eat. Eventually, they moved in with relatives.         Mrs. Crawford won a coveted cheerleader position, but hated facing the envy and resentment of the 90 girls who did not make it. Inspired by the marching of Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets at a nearby junior college, she asked her principal to start what she at first called a spirit group, something that all the girls could join the next year. Her idea was accepted, and the Sergeanettes took the field in the fall of 1930.         ''All of the women were included,'' Ms. Mar said. ''Nobody got left out.''         Mrs. Crawford then worked her way through what is now Pan American University, where she earned an associate's degree, while cleaning toilets for money and wearing damaged clothing to make ends meet. She earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and a master's degree from the University of Texas, writing a thesis titled, ''The Educational Value of Drill Teams in the High School Curriculum.''         She took her drill team idea to El Centro High School in El Centro, Calif., and from there to San Diego High School and Santa Monica High School. She added props, from canes to matador capes, and persuaded a friend in the fabric business to develop nylon pompoms as a more versatile substitute for paper ones.         She then taught physical education and coached drill teams at Santa Monica College, whose president, Richard Moore, said, ''With her batons, hats and costumes, she established college pride, no matter what the prowess of the athletic crew.''         Mrs. Crawford coached cheerleaders for the University of Southern California, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Express of the defunct United States Football League.         She opened a drill team summer camp, started an international competition for drill teams, founded and edited a magazine on the subject of drill teams, and wrote what some consider the definitive textbook on the subject.         Her husband, James H. Crawford, died several years ago after 54 years of marriage. A teetotaler, Mrs. Crawford met him while she was volunteering to greet returning veterans at a bar; he was the one wearing a marine uniform while drinking a glass of milk, their son Kim said.         Mrs. Crawford is survived by Kim, who lives in Dana Point, Calif.; another son, Jay, of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a daughter, Jan Crawford of Torrance, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Crawford did not achieve her loftiest ambition. She had been heartily campaigning to make drill team competitions an Olympic sport.       
         Jacqueline Hudson, a landscape painter, graphic artist and benefactor of the arts, died Wednesday at her home in Damariscotta, Me. She was 91.         Ms. Hudson was born in Cambridge, Mass., a daughter of the artist Eric Hudson. She grew up in Manhattan and Monhegan Island, Me., surrounded by her father's artist friends, including George Bellows, Robert Henri, Edward Hopper and Rockwell Kent. They often painted on Monhegan, where the Hudson family had its summer home.         After studying at the School of the National Academy and the Art Students League in New York, Ms. Hudson exhibited her work at the American Watercolor Society and the National Arts Club in New York, the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Me., the Portland Museum of Art and other museums and galleries throughout the United States.         She was known primarily for her paintings and lithographs of the Maine coast and, especially, of Monhegan, where she spent almost all of her 91 summers. Through the years, she amassed a vast collection of paintings by Bellows, Henri, her father and others, which she gave to the Monhegan Museum as a memorial to her family.         An exhibition of her work is scheduled to open as planned at the Round Top Center of the Arts in Damariscotta on Thursday.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Barbara Tropp, an innovative San Francisco chef, restaurateur and author of books about cooking, died on Oct. 26 at her apartment in San Francisco. She was 53 and had a second home in the Napa Valley.         The cause was ovarian cancer, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.         Ms. Tropp, a former Princeton student of Chinese and Chinese culture,  became a leading chef of the new American cuisine who liked to combine French and Chinese culinary concepts.         She delighted in serving the unexpected at her celebrated San Francisco restaurant, China Moon. For example, in 1988, when Asian influence on American cooking was felt most strongly on the West Coast but was spreading throughout the nation, Ms. Tropp served a Chinese pizzette, using Chinese scallion bread as the base. Atop the bread she placed coriander-flavored pork sausage and stir-fried wild mushrooms.         She wrote and taught about cooking as well as serving as chef at the restaurant for a decade. She sold it in 1996 because of poor health.         Her ''China Moon Cookbook'' (1992, Workman) was one of the first books that successfully brought together Chinese and European-American mainstream cooking.         The book won an award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals.         Ms. Tropp's other book was ''The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking: Techniques and Recipes'' (1982, Morrow).         Ms. Tropp grew up in Springfield, N.J., and became interested in China in high school. She graduated from Barnard College and received a master's degree in Chinese literature and art from Princeton. Then she learned about Chinese cooking as a student of poetic structure at the National University in Taiwan.         There ''classic Chinese with refined taste taught me how to eat and how to live,'' she told Craig Claiborne of The New York Times in a 1981 interview. She returned to the United States to work toward a Princeton doctorate in Chinese poetry and, she recalled, ''I had to learn to cook the food I had gotten used to eating in Taiwan.'' So she did.         Mr. Claiborne wrote that she ''speaks and writes fluent Mandarin, and this has given her a fine grasp of the meaning of Chinese cooking and menu terms.'' He said he had asked her why one of her dishes was ''called strange flavor eggplant, and she explained that it came from the word, 'guai,' which in Chinese poetry and art criticism can mean odd or weird.''         Last month she received the President's Award of the organization Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, of which she had been a founder.         Surviving are her husband, Bart Rhoades; two stepsons, Andrew and Matthew Rhoades; a stepdaughter, Elizabeth Rhoades; and a sister,  Nhumey Tropp.       
         Peggy Mount, for many years the fearsome battle-ax of British stage and screen with a voice to make henpecked husbands tremble, died on Tuesday at a London nursing home for actors. She was 85.         Although best known for her bullying, harridan roles, Ms. Mount was also successful in classical theater with much praised performances as the nurse to Judi Dench's Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's memorable Old Vic production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' in 1960 and in the title role of Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' at the Birmingham Repertory Theater in 1977.         She also made movies with major stars like Peter Sellers in ''The Naked Truth'' (1957) and Alec Guinness and Gina Lollobrigida in ''Hotel Paradiso'' (1966).         In the three years she played Emma Hornett, the iron-fisted, foghorn-voiced prospective mother-in-law in the 1955 West End farce ''Sailor Beware'' and in the subsequent film, Ms. Mount first made her name. One critic wrote of her performance in ''Sailor Beware'' that  ''with her hair scrapped up from her neck in a tight roll of curls, she is more intimidating than a fixed bayonet -- and with a voice to match.''         In 1971 she said, ''I'm not Lady Macbeth and never had any yearnings to be.''         Margaret Rose Mount was born on May 2, 1916, at Southend on Sea, the Essex seaside resort. Her childhood was unhappy. Her father died when she was 9, and she did not get along well with her mother.         The family's poverty forced her to leave school at 14 and work as a secretary. She discovered theater through the drama society at her church and studied acting privately.         She never married and left no immediate survivors.         She began her acting career in 1944 in repertory theater in the north of England and traveled all over the country until the success of ''Sailor Beware'' established her reputation.         She played similar dragon roles as Ada in a popular British television series called ''The Larkins'' in 1958 and in a similar series titled ''George and the Dragon'' in 1966. Later television credits included ''You're Only Young Twice'' and an appearance as a formidable Sister of Mercy in the ''Inspector Morse'' series.         During the rest of her career she continued to mix comedy with serious drama in London or on tour and the stage with films. In the 1970's she was a member of the National Theater Company, winning plaudits for her appearances in ''Il Campiello'' by Goldoni and Ben Travers's ''Plunder.''         From 1983 to 1985 she acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company in several plays, including ''The Dillon,'' ''Measure for Measure'' and a revival of the school farce ''The Happiest Days of Your Life.''         She was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1996.         She ended her career in 1998 when she lost her sight during a performance of Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya.''         ''The audience had no idea,'' she said. ''But the word soon got out, and I lost my nerve. Not working is my greatest regret. It was always my wish to die working.''       
         Mildred Rubenstein Newman, a New York psychologist whose vastly popular books helped meet an American yearning for emotional self-help and self-betterment in the 1970's, died Tuesday at her home on the Upper East Side. She was 81.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, her family said.         She and her husband, Dr. Bernard Berkowitz, a psychologist and psychiatrist, wrote ''How to Be Your Best Friend'' (Random House, 1973). A slender volume of practical advice simply expressed, it sold in the millions and remains in print at Ballantine.         The couple had their practice for many years in Greenwich Village, but more recently at their East Side residence. Their clientele included enough figures from the arts and entertainment for Miss Newman to be referred to as a therapist of the stars.         When their book came out, it carried endorsements on the back cover from Nora Ephron, Anthony Perkins, Rex Reed and Neil Simon. The couple followed up its success with ''How to Be Awake and Alive'' (Random House, 1975) and ''How to Take Charge of Your Life'' (Harcourt, Brace, 1977).         A native New Yorker, Miss Newman graduated in 1940 from Hunter College, where she received a master's degree in psychology in 1943. She completed an analytic training program at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis in Manhattan before going into practice.         In addition to her husband, Miss Newman is survived by a daughter, Sandy Newman, and a son, Dr. Neal Newman, both of Columbus, Ohio; a stepson, Bob Berkowitz, of Manhattan; a brother, Martin Rubenstein, of East Hampton, N.Y.; a sister, Ruth Hinkes, of West Palm Beach, Fla.; and five grandchildren.         ''We feel that our books should be an emotional experience,'' Miss Newman wrote, when ''How to Take Charge of Your Life'' first appeared, ''that they can be picked up at different times in a reader's life, and that they will be both energizing and comforting in times of crisis.''         Correction:  November 13, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Mildred Newman, a New York psychotherapist and author, misstated the title of a best-selling book of which she was co-author. It was ''How to Be Your Own Best Friend,'' not ''How to Be Your Best Friend.''       
         Patricia A. Locke, who worked for decades to preserve American Indian languages and became a pioneer in an effort to grant the tribes greater authority in the education of their children, died on Oct. 20 at a hospital in Phoenix. She was 73 and lived in Wakpala, S.D., on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Winona Flying Earth.         Ms. Locke, of Lakota and Chippewa heritage, won a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1991 for her work to save tribal languages that were growing extinct throughout the United States.         The award followed more than two decades of her advocacy for better education of Indians. In the 1970's, she was appointed to the Interior Department Task Force on Indian Education Policy, and eventually helped write legislation granting tribes the authority to set up their own education departments instead of following state requirements.         Education departments and tribal education codes were ultimately created among more than 30 tribes around the country, and Ms. Locke also helped 17 tribes establish colleges they controlled.         Patricia Ann McGillis was born on Jan. 21, 1928, on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1951. She married Charles E. Locke in 1952; they divorced in 1975.         Ms. Locke taught for more than 40 years, from elementary to university level, and lectured on Indian issues throughout the United States. She worked to protect sacred Indian sites and, starting in 1993, was national coordinator of a coalition that pushed for passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments, federal legislation adopted in 1994 that allowed use of peyote for religious purposes.         Ms. Locke's Indian name was Tawacin Waste Win, which, her daughter said, means ''she has good consciousness -- compassionate woman.''         Besides her daughter, who lives in Wakpala, she is survived by a son, Kevin Locke, also of Wakpala, a performing artist who works to preserve Lakota music; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Byrd Rawson, an educator, researcher and author who spent some 70 years identifying and treating reading disorders, died on Nov. 25 at her home near Frederick, Md. She was 102.         She wrote nine books and many articles on dyslexia and was an early and enduring force in the International Dyslexia Association, a 13,000-member professional group based in Maryland. She was its national president in the 1960's, when it was called the Orton Society. She received the group's lifetime achievement award on her 100th birthday.         Born in Rome, Ga., she was reared in Philadelphia and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore College in 1923. In 1940, she received a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied elementary education and psychology, with emphasis on educational testing and measurements.         In 1929, Mrs. Rawson helped establish the School in Rose Valley, a private school near Philadelphia, and was a librarian, psychologist and teacher until 1947. It was there that she came to the field of dyslexia.         She had been trying in vain to help a boy who had great trouble reading. Frustrated, she enlisted the assistance of Dr. Samuel T. Orton, the neurologist who identified dyslexia and its causes. Dr. Orton tested the child and sent him back with what are known as Orton-Gillingham teaching materials devised to overcome such difficulties. The boy was soon reading at grade level, and Mrs. Rawson had found her niche.         Mrs. Rawson conducted one of the longest-running studies of people with neurological language problems, tracking the lives of 56 children from the school for more than 50 years. Many of them went on to successful careers and stayed in contact with her.         Moving to Frederick in 1947, she taught sociology at Hood College. She also was a clinical psychologist and language consultant and had a private practice diagnosing and correcting language disorders.         Her books included ''A Bibliography on the Nature, Recognition and Treatment of Language Difficulties'' (1966) and ''Developmental Language Disability: Adult Accomplishments of Dyslexic Boys'' (1968).         Mrs. Rawson's husband, Arthur, an engineer, died in 1963. She is survived by a son, Kenneth S., of Swarthmore, Pa.; six grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Rawson was 99 when she testified before the Maryland Department of Education. The hearing, on the teaching of reading, lasted four hours and she was there for the duration.       
         Pauline Campanelli, a painter whose super-realist still lifes were so popular that their sales were rivaled only by those of Andrew Wyeth among living artists, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Pohatcong Township, N.J., a few miles south of Phillipsburg. She was 58.         Her husband, Dan, also a painter, said she died of complications from childhood polio. She had been seriously ill for nearly three years.         Her work was seldom reviewed; and when it was, the reviews generally ran in obscure publications. It was absent from prestigious art museums and expensive galleries. But in the nation's kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms, her precise, loving depictions of household objects were commonplace.         Her work recalled the Shakers in its simplicity and spirituality. Her later paintings were characterized by stark white backgrounds.         Hundreds of thousands of her prints were sold through mail-order catalogs, furniture stores and galleries specializing in prints and posters. Sales of her most popular picture, ''Wild Rose Berries,'' have exceeded 600,000.         ''She outsells Picasso,'' said Julie Fleischmann, president of Shorewood Fine Art, a unit of the New York Graphic Society, which licenses art and sells prints by both the Campanellis and Picasso.         Mrs. Campanelli described herself ''not as an artist who paints but as a person who lives.'' Her paintings, she said, were not creations ''but communications of the essence of that experience.''         She lived with her husband in a stone farmhouse they restored; it is included in the National Register of Historic Places. And despite needing a wheelchair to get around, she pursued dozens of homespun crafts.         Each year she canned 400 jars of fruit from the 39 trees the couple had planted. A talented quilter, cross-stitcher and yarn spinner, she used antique spinning wheels to turn fleece from her four Dorset sheep into yarn that she colored with dyes made from her homegrown herbs. The primitive American antiques she collected were frequent subjects for her paintings.         ''These are not the nostalgic relics of a long forgotten past, but objects that Dan and I live with every day,'' she said.         Her sensibility was decidedly not that of a folk artist. ''Whether it's a swan decoy or a quilt or a chair, I'm just looking at abstract shapes: rectangles, triangles, S-shapes, tall things, round things,'' she said in an interview in the journal U.S. Art in 1989. ''I am very much influenced by Mondrian's compositions.''         Another influence on her art was her belief in paganism. She wrote books, some with her husband, about witchcraft and pagan rituals and tried to bring her appreciation of ancient, pre-Christian ways to her rustic life as well as to her art.         Her book ''Ancient Ways: Reclaiming Pagan Traditions'' (Llewellyn, 1991) told how pagan cultures celebrated holidays, and it sold more than 40,000 copies. The Halloween section not only gave advice on charms and spells, crystal balls and using a tambourine to contact spirits but also gave a recipe for pumpkin bread. The May Day section said washing one's face with morning dew on that holiday would preserve a youthful complexion.         Pauline Eblé was born in the Bronx on Jan. 25, 1943. She was stricken with polio at 3 and was in an iron lung for a year and in the hospital for another year and a half. She was tutored at home and at 13 was studying college textbooks.         She was fascinated with the way her father, Joseph, a professional photographer, could condense three-dimensional reality into two-dimensional images, but she was not initially interested in art. She wanted to be a naturalist and illustrate the species she hoped to discover.         After finishing high school in Ridgewood, N.J., she attended the Ridgewood School of Art. She began selling still lifes while in school.         In 1969 she married Mr. Campanelli. According to a biography posted on the Llewellyn Web site, they were already practicing witchcraft. They lived in a $60-a-month furnished room painted bubble-gum pink and made a bare living, $2,000 the first year, from teaching and sidewalk art shows. Through competitions, bigger art shows and interest from galleries in the area, they gradually got their heads above water.         She earned a reputation for oil paintings of homey objects, and he drew attention for his watercolors of old mills and other historic scenes. In 1976 they bought a stone house built in 1835, naming it and the three surrounding acres Flying Witch Farm. Because they could not get a mortgage and had no savings, they had to restore the sagging, abandoned structure themselves.         He used antique tools because the house had no electricity to plug in power tools. She climbed down from her wheelchair and refinished the floors on her hands and knees.         They filled their new home with antiques like Cromwell chairs from the 1660's and a William and Mary side table from around 1690. Mrs. Campanelli copied a needlepoint design for the Cromwell chairs from museum slides.         Mr. Campanelli built a garage for the three Model A's he restored and a building to house his wife's ''natural history museum,'' which included at least 10,000 seashells. They pressed grapes in an 1860 fruit press and made 100 gallons of wine a year. They occasionally held what they called Colonial days for their friends, entertaining with a quilting bee, a black-powder shoot, a tomahawk throw and Colonial food.         Mrs. Campanelli, who is survived by her husband and father, painted standing on crutches in an 8-by-10-foot studio that used to be a bedroom. The light streamed through a rippled north window, the sort of light she thought Rembrandt liked.         She worked very slowly, averaging about six paintings a year. She meticulously showed each thread in a ball of yarn. She painted any flowers last, in order not to be hurried.         The Campanellis had long thought that a ghost inhabited Flying Witch Farm: that of Mary Insley Hunt, a member of the family that long owned the place.         ''I think Pauline's going to be the next one,'' her husband suggested. ''She wanted to be.''       
         Frances Elizabeth Holberton, one of the first computer programmers, whose contributions to software over the years ranged from an early data-sorting program to helping develop the business programming language Cobol, died on Dec. 8 at a nursing home in Rockville, Md. She was 84.         The cause was heart disease, diabetes and complications from a stroke that she suffered several years ago, according to her daughter, Priscilla Holberton of Silver Spring, Md.         ''Betty Holberton was a real software pioneer,'' said Donald E. Knuth, a professor emeritus at Stanford University and author of the three-volume ''The Art of Computer Programming,'' the profession's defining treatise.         Mrs. Holberton, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, was one of the six young women recruited by the Army to program the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, which became known by its evocative acronym, Eniac. The Eniac is credited with being the first all-electronic digital computer.         The Eniac's job was to calculate the firing trajectories for artillery shells. The young women programmers were selected for their skills in mathematics. The work they did was ''hard-wired'' programming, laboriously setting switches and cables inside the 30-ton black behemoth of a machine.         Mrs. Holberton, colleagues recall, was particularly adept at figuring out the best path for guiding the complex calculations through the electronic labyrinth of the Eniac. Frequently, these insights came to her overnight.         ''Betty had an amazing logical mind, and she solved more problems in her sleep than other people did awake,'' recalled Jean J. Bartik, another of the Eniac programmers.         The Eniac was demonstrated in February 1946, too late for use in World War II, but it helped open the door to modern computing. The Eniac programming team broke up, but Mrs. Holberton was the one of the six who stayed longest in the field.         After the war, she joined the Eniac designers, John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, in their effort to develop the Univac, an early commercial computer, which was introduced in 1951. While working on the Univac, Mrs. Holberton did some of her most innovative work. She developed a program for sorting and merging large data files, which at the time were stored on reels of magnetic tape. Any such updating of data files was an arduous programming task at the time, and her program vastly simplified that job.         ''That was a huge tour de force,'' said Paul E. Ceruzzi, a computer historian at the Smithsonian Institution.         In 1953, Mrs. Holberton joined the Navy's Applied Math Lab at the David Taylor Model Basin in Maryland as the supervisor of advanced programming, where she worked until 1966. In 1959, she was a crucial member of the committee that developed Cobol, or Common Business Oriented Language. The committee worked for six months on the standards and specifications for a business programming language, which was introduced in 1960.         The committee's work was seen as a temporary solution to the growing problem created by the increasing need for a standard programming language for handling business data at a time when computing was moving into the mainstream of the corporate world. Yet Cobol, updated many times over the years, is still widely used.         Computer scientists often criticize Cobol as a hasty, inelegantly designed programming language. But it gave computing a way to handle and visually describe business data, making it easier to program business problems on computers.         Mrs. Holberton, who joined the National Bureau of Standards in 1966 and worked there for two decades, once echoed those views. In a 1983 interview conducted for the Charles Babbage Institute, a computing history center at the University of Minnesota, Mrs. Holberton conceded some of the criticisms of the language she helped develop. But, she added, ''Cobol, I felt, was very important because of its ability to describe data.''         According to Kathryn Kleiman, a lawyer who is working on a documentary film on the women in the Eniac program and their contribution to the field, Mrs. Holberton consistently worked on trying to make computers easier to program.         ''She took that hard-won knowledge on the Eniac and applied it over the next 40 years, in nearly everything she did in the field,'' Ms. Kleiman said.         In addition the her daughter Priscilla, Mrs. Holberton is survived by her husband, John Vaughn Holberton, and another daughter, Pamela Holberton, both of Rockville.       
         Martha Mödl, one of Germany's leading Wagnerian singers, died last Sunday in a hospital in Stuttgart. She was 89.         Miss Mödl was known as much for her dramatic intensity as for her powerful, thrilling voice, which sometimes betrayed difficulties in the upper register. She began her career in mezzo-soprano roles and returned to them later in her career. This did not keep her from being a major Brünnhilde and a celebrated Isolde in her prime. ''This is a singer with temperament, an abundance of animal spirits and brains to boot,'' Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in February 1957, during her debut season with the Metropolitan Opera.         Miss Mödl, who was born in Nuremberg on March 12, 1912, had a relatively late start as a professional singer. She worked as a secretary until she was 28, and did not make her stage debut until 1942, when she sang Hänsel in Humperdinck's ''Hänsel und Gretel'' at the opera house in Remscheid. A short time later, her career had a temporary setback when she was conscripted to work in a munitions factory.         After the war, in 1945, Miss Mödl performed at the opera house in Düsseldorf, where she took on such mezzo roles as Dorabella (''Così Fan Tutte''), Octavian (''Der Rosenkavalier'') and Carmen. The role of Marie in Berg's ''Wozzeck,'' which she first sang in 1947, opened the way to 20th-century opera, in which she was later to specialize, and was also her first excursion into soprano territory. Soprano roles proved to have a hold: in 1950, she took on Kundry (''Parsifal'') and Verdi's Lady Macbeth in Berlin. Isolde, Venus (''Tannhäuser'') and all three ''Ring'' Brünnhildes soon followed.         Miss Mödl's international fame was secured through her association with Wieland Wagner, who invited her to sing Kundry at the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1951. Epitomizing Mr. Wagner's vision of the ideal soprano for his new Bayreuth, she continued to appear there until 1967, in a range of roles. She noted that she was perhaps the only soprano to have appeared in all three female leads in ''Die Walküre'' at Bayreuth, having sung Brünnhilde, Sieglinde and, finally, Fricka.         Miss Mödl took part in other significant postwar reopenings. In 1955 she sang Leonore in the ''Fidelio'' that opened the restored Vienna State Opera, which she later called ''one of the most memorable moments of my life.'' In 1963, at the opening of the rebuilt National Theater in Munich, she appeared in ''Die Frau Ohne Schatten'' in the role of the Nurse.         Her Metropolitan Opera career was somewhat more circumscribed. She made her American debut at the house in the 1956-57 season in ''Siegfried'' and ''Götterdämmerung,'' added Isolde and Kundry in 1958, and returned in the ''Ring'' and ''Parsifal'' in the 1959-60 season. Her appearances, if few, were celebrated.         Miss Mödl never retired. When she was compelled to leave her signature Wagner roles, she simply explored new repertory, appearing in contemporary works by Stravinsky (who conducted her in ''Oedipus Rex''), Hans Werner Henze (''Elegy for Young Lovers''), Aribert Reimann (''Melusine,'' ''Gespenstersonate'') and Wolfgang Fortner (''Elizabeth Tudor,'' ''Die Bluthochzeit'').         She continued to appear onstage until the end of her life. Miss Mödl was one of the last exponents of the diva who gave her life to her art. Not that she necessarily embraced the role. ''I never had the talent to be a diva,'' she said in an interview, ''but I just like to sing and act so much.''       
         Mary Whitehouse, a British schoolteacher and mother of three who for more than 30 years campaigned vociferously against sex, violence and blasphemy on television, stage and screen, died on Nov. 23 in Colchester, England. She was 91.         Variously called ''the most dangerous woman in Britain,'' ''the Queen of Clean'' and ''the Archangel of Anti-Smut,'' Mrs. Whitehouse became in the end a beloved national institution, though she achieved far less than she sought. She struggled tirelessly to quell a rising tide of libertarianism in British public entertainment as the country traversed the ''Swinging 60's'' and embraced the ''Permissive Society.''         Her case, put simply, was that television programs and theater obsessed with sex and violence would breed that kind of a society. Many people agreed with her.         She was not without effect. ''The Clean Up TV Campaign,'' which she started in 1964 and which the next year became the National Viewers and Listeners Association, influenced several pieces of British legislation.         These included the 1978 Protection of Children Act, which curbed the pornographic exploitation of minors; the Indecent Displays Acts of 1981, regulating shop window displays and magazine covers; the creation of a Broadcasting Standards Committee in 1988; and the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which dealt with television obscenity.         She was responsible for banning the Danish film ''The Sex Life of Jesus Christ'' in 1977. In 1979, she instigated Britain's first blasphemy trial in 52 years, which resulted in a suspended nine-month jail sentence for the editor of Gay News. In 1982, she brought, but later dropped, a private prosecution against Howard Brenton's play ''The Romans in Britain,'' which explicitly portrayed sexual acts.         Her bête noire was Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, the BBC's liberal director general from 1960 to 1969, whom she called ''the Devil incarnate.'' Not only did he ignore and snub her, he also used to throw darts at a picture of her he had acquired, which depicted her as having five breasts.         But even if the tasks she had set herself were possible, which seems doubtful today, her all-or-nothing, blunderbuss approach doomed her efforts to failure.         Beloved British comics were condemned along with obvious pornographers because they all used words like damn and bloody. Anything that included foul language, adultery or homosexuality was bad in her eyes, regardless of its artistic quality or overall moral stance.         As a result, she was soon attacking a lengthening list of admired and popular works, including the ''EastEnders'' television series; Lord Snowdon's acclaimed documentary about old age, ''Don't Count The Candles''; and Dennis Potter's ''Singing Detective.''         Mary Hutcheson was born in Nuneaton, in Cheshire, on June 13, 1910. She was a staunch Christian and member of the Moral Rearmament movement who at 20 fell in love with an older married man but left him when she saw the unhappiness she had caused his wife.         She trained as an art teacher, and in 1940 married Ernest Whitehouse, an engineer, who died last year. After raising three sons, who survive her, she returned to teaching in 1960, becoming senior mistress at a Shropshire secondary school, in charge of sex education.         This anonymous provincial existence changed in 1963 with the eruption of the Profumo sex scandal, when Mrs. Whitehouse was horrified to discover that her girls regarded Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, the two call girls at the center of the affair, as heroines and role models. The next year she started her Clean Up TV Campaign.         Correction:  December 20, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 3 about Mary Whitehouse, a British crusader against pornography, misidentified her native county. Her birthplace, Nuneaton, is in Warwickshire, not Cheshire.
