        Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago.         The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).         Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).         Some of Her Other Films         Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953).         The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000.         From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards.         The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907.         When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again.         Left School at Age 13         Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family.         At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' ''         In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.         Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra.         'Beloved by All' Involved         Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.''         Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston.         Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times.         Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice:         ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.''         Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom.         Praise for 'Thorn Birds'         In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.''         Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce:         ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.''         In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer.

And, in 1987, her colleagues and admirers added their tributes to her independent spirit and professionalism as she received the 15th annual life achievement award of the American Film Institute.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).

        Trude Fleischmann, a portrait photographer known in her native Vienna as the Photographer of the Famous, died on Saturday at the home of her nephew in Brewster, N.Y. She was 94 years old.         Trude Fleischmann, a portrait photographer known in her native Vienna as the Photographer of the Famous, died on Saturday at the home of her nephew in Brewster, N.Y. She was 94 years old.         Two years ago Ms. Fleischmann broke one leg in a fall at her home in Lugano, Switzerland, then broke the other in a fall in the hospital. When she left the hospital, her nephew, Stefan Carrell, brought her to the United States.         Photographs by Ms. Fleischmann are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, George Eastman House in Rochester and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. Among her subjects were Hedy Lamarr, Arturo Toscanini, Eleanor Roosevelt, Raymond Massey, Albert Einstein, Sinclair Lewis, Paul Robeson, Gian Carlo Menotti and Conrad Veidt.         Ms. Fleischmann, who lived and worked in Vienna, London and New York, never received the attention accorded some portraitists. The first exhibition to bring her prominence in the United States was in San Francisco in 1981. Her agent, Dorothy Garfein, said Ms. Fleischmann ''never promoted herself'' and regarded herself as a photographer and not as an artist. By the 1960's, when photography began to receive widespread acceptance as art, Ms. Fleischmann had retired and moved to Lugano.         She studied art history in Paris and began her career as an apprentice in a Viennese portrait studio. A few years ago Ms. Garfein catalogued more than 4,000 negatives made after the photographer came to the United States. Before leaving Austria in the late 1930's, she destroyed virtually all the negatives she had made.         She is survived by her nephew.       
        More than two dozen artists, writers, art critics, friends and former students paid tribute to Elaine de Kooning, the painter, art writer, teacher and wife of Willem de Kooning at a memorial service last night at Cooper Union in Manhattan. Mrs. de Kooning died of lung cancer on Feb. 1, 1989.         More than two dozen artists, writers, art critics, friends and former students paid tribute to Elaine de Kooning, the painter, art writer, teacher and wife of Willem de Kooning at a memorial service last night at Cooper Union in Manhattan. Mrs. de Kooning died of lung cancer on Feb. 1, 1989.         Among those who spoke at the more than two-and-a-half-hour service, which the editor Rose Slivka called ''the marathon memorial,'' were the poet John Ashbery, the gallery owner Leo Castelli, the artists Joop Sanders and Al Copley, the photographer Rudy Burckhardt and Mrs. de Kooning's brother Peter Fried. Many recalled not only Mrs. de Kooning's artistic agility and intelligence as a writer, but also her irrepressible humor, her capacity for friendship and generosity, and her fascination with language.         Slides were shown of her paintings from 1947 to 1988, including realistic landscapes and portraits as well as colorful abstract works informed by Abstract Expressionism and, in later years, inspired by the paleolithic cave drawings in France and Spain. The memorial was held on what would have been the artist's 70th birthday.         ''Art was her meaning, her solace, her exuberance,'' said the artist Herman Cherry.         'Complete Absorption'         Other artists spoke of Mrs. de Kooning's versatility, concentration and speed as a painter. ''She had an uncanny eye,'' said the artist Sherman Drexler. ''There was such complete absorption that enveloped her when she picked up a pen or brush.''         The audience of about 300 also saw a quarter-century's photographs by Hans Namuth of Mrs. de Kooning in her studio in East Hampton, L.I., and with Mr. de Kooning, whom she married in 1943. Grace Hartigan, an artist, recalled that when Mrs. de Kooning was asked how it felt to live in her husband's shadow, she replied, ''I lived in his light.''         Mrs. de Kooning - who taught at 15 colleges and universities, including Yale University, Carnegie-Mellon University, Cooper Union and Bard College - was also remembered for her enthusiasm as a teacher and her self-defined role as a ''fairy godmother'' to young artists. Barbara Schwartz, one of several former students who spoke, called her ''an ardent talent scout'' and said she is establishing a scholarship in Mrs. de Kooning's name at Bard.         Joan Washburn, a gallery owner, read excerpts from several of the many reviews and monographs Mrs. de Kooning wrote about contemporary art, citing her ''ability to move with complete abandon from the sublime to the ridiculous.''         Indeed, many spoke of Mrs. de Kooning's wit and remembered incidents like a baseball game she played in high heels and an invitation for coffee to someone who had mugged her. Others evoked her humor by quoting her often-disarming aphorisms, like: ''Take care of the luxuries; the necessities will take care of themselves.''       
        Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         In her late teens, she took a leave from high school to dance with Isadora Duncan's troupe in Europe. In the 1920's, she had minor roles on Broadway in ''The Green Hat'' and ''Saturday's Children.''         She left acting to pursue a career in real estate and cultivate her native hamlet of Sneden's Landing in Orangetown, overlooking the Hudson River, as a community of artists, writers and actors. Mrs. Gugler was following in the steps of her mother, an artist, who acquired almost two dozen homes in the secluded hamlet around the turn of the century and sought out poets, actors and musicians as tenants.         Sneden's Landing eventually became a haven for artistic celebrities, including Noel Coward, Laurence Olivier, Ethel Barrymore, Katharine Cornell and E. B. White. Today, the actors Bill Murray and William Hurt own homes there, as does Mikhail Baryshnikov.         Mrs. Gugler's husband, the architect Eric Gugler, died in 1974. She is survived by a sister, Alexandra, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Helene Pons, a leading costume designer for almost four decades until her retirement in 1965, died of kidney problems yesterday at a private clinic in Rome. She was within two weeks of her 92d birthday.         Helene Pons, a leading costume designer for almost four decades until her retirement in 1965, died of kidney problems yesterday at a private clinic in Rome. She was within two weeks of her 92d birthday.         Mrs. Pons designed and executed the costumes for such shows as ''Our Town,'' ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ''Babes in Arms'' and ''The Time of the Cuckoo.'' She also executed the designs for scores of other shows, including ''My Fair Lady,'' ''Camelot,'' ''Kiss Me Kate'' and ''Pal Joey'' and for many productions of the Metropolitan Opera Company, American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet.         She once noted that one of her most troublesome stage designs was the slip worn by Barbara Bel Geddes in the original 1955 production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' The slip was remade several times because ''she had to be decent,'' Mrs. Pons said. ''Yet it had to look just like any ordinary slip you buy in a store,'' she added.         Known for her fractured pronunciation - speaking French with a Russian accent and English with a French accent - she was also, at times, impatient and explosive. She was said to have once screamed at an assistant, in one breath, ''You go to hell and be sure to get back here by 4:30!''         Running a Studio         Mrs. Pons, the former Helene Wermicheff, was born on April 30, 1898, in Tiflis in the Caucasus of Russia. She was educated in Switzerland and in 1920 went to Paris to study art. There she met and married George Pons, technical director of the Chauve Souris, a theater company organized by Soviet emigres.         The company traveled to England and, in 1922, to New York City, where Mrs. Pons and her husband established a studio for the design and execution of stage costumes in 1923. Mrs. Pons was in charge of the designs and Mr. Pons, who died in 1959, took care of the business side of the firm.         ''She has an intuition,'' Mr. Pons once said. ''I have accuracy, but she is an artist.''         Mrs. Pons, who spent the years after her retirement living in New York, California and Rome, entered the Rome clinic in August.         She is survived by a daughter, Giselle Marziale, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, all of whom live in Rome. Burial is to take place tomorrow at the Marzione family tomb in Verano Cemetery in Rome.         Correction:  April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Friday about the costume designer Helene Pons misidentified the designer of the slip worn by Barbara Bel Geddes in the original 1955 production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' It was Lucinda Ballard, not Mrs. Pons.       
        Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Miss Goddard, a Hollywood star of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, was also publicized for her friendships with many notable figures; her marriages to Charles Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque, and her glamorous life style.         The actress, a former fashion model and showgirl, made her first major screen appearance in 1936 as a waterfront waif befriended by a forsaken assembly-line worker (played by Chaplin) in ''Modern Times,'' the last silent comedy feature.         Hollywood quickly took notice, and Miss Goddard earned leading comedy roles as an adventuress in ''The Young in Heart,'' as a battling wife seeking a Reno divorce in ''The Women,'' and as Bob Hope's pert romantic foil in ''The Cat and the Canary'' and ''The Ghost Breakers.''         Other early roles included a put-upon laundress in Mr. Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' (1940); Fred Astaire's partner in ''Second Chorus'' (1941), in which she gamely struggled to keep up with him in the dance ''I Ain't Hep to That Step, But I'll Dig It,'' and a lusty Southern belle singing a suggestive sea chanty to a party of prudes in the 1942 adventure ''Reap the Wild Wind.''         Runner-Up for Scarlett         The last of these roles was a consolation prize for the major disappointment of her acting career: losing the coveted part of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh in the final round of the ''Gone With the Wind'' competition. At the time Miss Goddard said she ''cried her eyes out,'' but years later she said she recalled the episode as only ''like a game.''         Miss Goddard, an energetic and articulate woman, was a close friend of a wide range of artists, including the composer George Gershwin, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and the artist Andy Warhol. She was wealthy, both from her Hollywood salaries and her husbands, but in later years she sold many costly artworks at auction, including her collection of Impressionist art, which was sold in 1979 for $2.9 million.         At the time, she said her reason for selling was no secret. ''It's because I don't want the responsibility any longer for this movable feast,'' she said, explaining that she was tired of carting the art from Switzerland to California and New York when she changed residences. Coincidentally, more than 20 items in her extensive jewelry collection are being sold today as part of an auction at Sotheby's in New York.         Tributes for Giving and Acting         The actress was known for her philanthropies as well as her art and gems. In the last 12 years, she awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to 300 theater and film students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She had previously given the university the diaries, manuscripts and personal library of Remarque, who died in 1970. In a statement yesterday, John Brademas, the university's president, hailed the ''vision and continued generosity'' of ''this remarkable actress.''         Miss Goddard's acting also inspired tributes. The writer Robert Benchley praised her as ''a woman who could charm a rock,'' and Ray Milland, a frequent co-star, hailed her as ''the most honest actress I ever knew; she gave it all she had.''         A celebrated Goddard role was a witty social-climber in ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' directed in 1946 by Jean Renoir. She said she preferred such roles to ''sweet, boring'' parts and that moviegoers also favored ''adventuruous characters because 90 percent of the public is good.'' When an interviewer called her glamorous, she defined glamour as ''a spell of charm,'' adding: ''I don't want to be a phony. I want to be real.''         The actress could also be blunt. When several of her friends were accused of being Communists by members of Congress in 1947, she remarked, ''If anyone accuses me of being a Communist, I'll hit them with my diamond bracelets.''         Powers Model and Ziegfeld Girl         Paulette Goddard was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I., on June 3, 1911, according to major film refererence works. However, news agencies yesterday quoted municipal employees in Ronco as giving her birth year of record as 1905. Her parents separated in her childhood, and she later chose her mother's maiden name, Goddard.         She left school early and became a Powers model and then a Ziegfeld Girl. She was briefly married to Edgar W. James, a lumber industrialist, and soon sought fame in Hollywood. She played a series of chorus and other bit parts, joined the Hal Roach stock company and met Mr. Chaplin, from whom she became inseparable.         Miss Goddard's later film roles included ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940), ''Nothing But the Truth'' (1941), ''So Proudly We Hail'' (1943), ''Kitty'' (1946), ''Unconquered'' (1947) and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1949).         Her roles in the 1950's were disappointing, and, except for a 1964 Italian film, ''Time of Indifference,'' she lived in retirement with Mr. Remarque from the time of her marriage to the novelist in 1958 until his death. Her other marriges ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, Miss Vaughan influenced countless other singers - including Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade and Rickie Lee Jones - and made hits of such songs as ''It's Magic,'' ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' and ''Broken-Hearted Melody.'' Her ornate renditions of ''Misty'' and ''Send In the Clowns'' were invariable show-stoppers at jazz festivals in recent years, including the JVC Jazz Festival in New York, at which she appeared almost yearly.         Her voice remained remarkably unravaged by time; in her mid-60's, a period when most singers' vocal powers have sharply diminished, she was still close to her peak. Though her speaking voice deepened and darkened in later years, her singing retained a youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre, and she could still project delicate but ringingly high coloratura passages.         Where more idiosyncratic jazz artists like Billie Holiday excelled at interpretation, Miss Vaughan was a contralto who gloried in displaying the distinctive instrumental qualities of a voice that had a comfortable three-octave range and was marked by a voluptuous, heavy vibrato. Known for her dazzling vocal leaps and swoops, she was equally adept at be-bop improvisation and singing theater songs with a symphony orchestra. Among the singers of her generation, only Ella Fitzgerald enjoyed comparable stature.         ''She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,'' the singer Mel Torme said yesterday. ''So much so that I used to call her the diva. At one point, I asked her why she had never opted for an operatic career. She got kind of huffy, and said, 'Do you mean jazz isn't legit?' She was very defensive about being a jazz singer. Where someone like Benny Goodman was able to split his musical image and record Mozart concerts, she wanted to perform precisely where she was.''         Appropriate Nicknames         Throughout her career, Miss Vaughan was affectionately known as Sassy or the Divine Sarah. The first nickname reflected her sense of humor and the mischievous sexiness that often inflected her singing and stage patter. The second, appropriated from the legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt, acknowledged her phenomenonally versatile voice. Foremost among the singers Miss Vaughan admired was the soprano Leontyne Price, to whom she bore more than a passing vocal resemblance.         John S. Wilson, in a New York Times review of a Vaughan performance in 1957, credited the singer with ''what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.''         When Miss Vaughan appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in 1974 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, Mr. Wilson commented on the ''soaring highs and incredibly full lows'' she displayed in her opening numbers and summed up the conclusion of her concert as ''totally virtuosic.''         Sarah Lois Vaughan was born in Newark, on March 27, 1924. Her father was a carpenter and amateur guitarist and her mother a laundress and church vocalist. She studied the piano from the age of 7 and later took up the organ, and at age 12 she became the organist at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, where she was also a soloist in the choir.         Career Began on a Dare         She also enjoyed performing popular tunes at parties, and when friends urged her to enter an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in New York, she took the dare and won first prize in October 1942, singing ''Body and Soul.'' The singer Billy Eckstine heard her perform, and six months after winning the contest she was hired at his recommendation as a second pianist and singer with Earl (Fatha) Hines's big band, in which Mr. Eckstine was a vocalist and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were instrumentalists.         The following year, when Mr. Eckstine formed his own band - which featured Mr. Parker, Mr. Gillespie, Art Blakey and Miles Davis, among other jazz greats - Miss Vaughan went along, and remained with him for a year. After a two-month stint in John Kirby's jazz group in the winter of 1945-46, she began a solo career. Her early solo recordings - on which she performed songs like ''Lover Man'' in full-blown be-bop style, accompanied by Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie -helped establish her reputation as a jazz singer.         First Husband Was Her Manager         During an extended engagement at Cafe Society Downtown in New York City, Miss Vaughan met George Treadwell, a trumpet player, whom she married. He became her manager, and under his guidance she made the transition from jazz cult figure to popular singing star.         She had her first hit in late 1947 with ''Tenderly,'' for the small Musicraft label. The following year, her version of ''It's Magic,'' a song from the movie ''Romance on the High Seas,'' established her as a full-fledged pop star. In 1949, she signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, where she remained until 1954, recording mostly popular songs backed by studio orchestras. Out of more than a dozen hits she had on Columbia, the most successful was ''These Things I Offer You,'' in 1951. Although most of her Columbia hits were disposable pop confections, she also recorded many lasting standards. Columbia recently reissued a collection of 28 songs she recorded between 1949 and 1953.         When Miss Vaughan moved to the Mercury label in 1954, she was given the freedom to pursue a dual career as both a popular and jazz singer. For EmArcy, Mercury's jazz subsidiary, she recorded with Clifford Brown, Cannonball Adderley and members of Count Basie's Orchestra, among other jazz artists. On the parent label, she also scored a steady succession of hits for the rest of the decade.         Songs of Seduction         Two of her biggest successes, ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' (1954) and ''Whatever Lola Wants'' (1955), from the Broadway musical ''Damn Yankees,'' were songs of seduction in which her almost overripe timbre gave an extra edge of sensuality to come-hither messages. Her two other biggest hits were the title song of the Broadway show ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956) and ''Broken-Hearted Melody'' (1959), a ballad with a light rock-and-roll beat. Her complete output for Mercury -263 cuts - was recently reissued.         After 1959, Miss Vaughan would never have any commercially significant pop hits. But over the next 30 years, her reputation as consummate vocal artist soared steadily, thanks to her appearances in nightclubs, at jazz festivals and increasingly with symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad.         During the 1960's, she recorded briefly with Roulette, then again with Mercury and Columbia, and in the 70's and early 80's she made albums for Mainstream and Pablo. It was for Pablo, run by the jazz producer Norman Granz, that she recorded the most critically acclaimed album of her career, ''How Long Has This Been Going On?'' in which she sang with a group that included Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown.         The singer's later recordings ranged from an album of Beatles tunes to a collection of Brazilian pop songs. On CBS's classical crossover recording of ''South Pacific,'' she sang the role of Bloody Mary, and on Quincy Jones's all-star pop-jazz album, ''Back on the Block,'' she and Ella Fitzgerald sang together on a version of Josef Zawinul's ''Birdland.'' In 1982 she won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, for her ''Gershwin Live!'' recording on CBS.         Two Perennial Offerings         Though Miss Vaughan's repertory during her 1980's appearances at the JVC Festival varied from year to year, two songs she would always perform were ''Misty,'' which she had first recorded in 1957 with Mr. Jones, and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which became her musical signature during the last decade of her life.         Living up to her Sassy sobriquet, the singer liked to perform ''Misty'' as a duet with herself, singing the first half in her regular voice, than dipping to the bottom of her contralto to do an amusing imitation of a seductive male lounge singer. ''Send In the Clowns,'' the song that usually closed her shows, became her ultimate vocal showpiece, a three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression. The performances invariably won standing ovations.         Mr. Jones, who first worked with Miss Vaughan in Paris in 1957 when they recorded the original vocal rendition of ''Misty,'' had recently signed her to record a Brazilian fusion album on his label, Qwest. ''Sarah was the most musical singer America has ever known,'' Mr. Jones said yesterday.         Miss Vaughan's marriage to Mr. Treadwell ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Clyde Atkins, a professional football player; Marshall Fisher, a Las Vegas restaurateur, and Waymon Reed, a trumpet player.         She is survived by her mother, Ada, and a daughter, Deborah Vaughan, who uses the first name Paris for her acting career. Both live in Los Angeles.         Miss Vaughan's body will be flown to Newark for a funeral service on Saturday at Mount Zion Baptist Church.

        Mary Oppen, an author and artist, died of ovarian cancer on Monday at Alta Bates-Herrick Hospital in Berkeley, Calif. She was 81 years old and lived in Albany, Calif.         Mary Oppen, an author and artist, died of ovarian cancer on Monday at Alta Bates-Herrick Hospital in Berkeley, Calif. She was 81 years old and lived in Albany, Calif.         Born in Kalispell, Mont., Mrs. Oppen, whose maiden name was Colby, was the author of ''Poems and Transpositions'' (1980) and ''Meaning a Life'' (1978), an autobiography. In that work, she wrote of her life with her husband, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet George Oppen, who died in 1984.         Prints, paintings and collages by Mrs. Oppen have been seen in shows including the 19th National Exhibition of Prints at the Library of Congress in 1963.         She is survived by a daughter, Linda Mourelatos of Austin, Tex.       
        June Christy, whose wistful, foggy alto epitomized ''cool'' jazz singing in the 1940's and 50's, died Thursday at the age of 64 at her home in Los Angeles.         June Christy, whose wistful, foggy alto epitomized ''cool'' jazz singing in the 1940's and 50's, died Thursday at the age of 64 at her home in Los Angeles.         The cause of death was complications from kidney failure, said her husband, Bob Cooper, whom she met when he was a saxophonist for the Stan Kenton Orchestra, the band with which Miss Christy first gained great popularity in 1945.         Miss Christy, named Shirley Luster at her birth in Springfield, Ill., grew up in nearby Decatur and at the age of 13 began singing with a local band led by Bill Oetyel. After graduating from high school, she moved to Chicago, where she sang with society bands. Finding that her tastes leaned to jazz, she joined a band led by Boyd Raeburn and then one led by Benny Strong.         Named Top Vocalist Four Times         Anita O'Day, then the lead singer for the Kenton band, later recalled hearing Miss Christy at a Chicago club called the Three Deuces and recommending her to Mr. Kenton as Miss O'Day's replacement.         Among the band's three most famous lead singers, who also included Chris Connor, Miss Christy worked with the band the longest, six years. Four times from 1946 to 1950 she was chosen ''best female vocalist with a big band'' in Down Beat's annual poll.         Miss Christy's first recording with the Kenton band, ''Tampico,'' was released in May 1945 and sold a million copies. Several other hit records with the band followed, including ''It's Been a Long, Long Time'' (1945), ''Shoo-Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy'' (1946) and ''Lonely Woman'' (1948).         Miss Christy lasted with the band through several complete changes of lineup, finally leaving in 1951, although she and the band reunited on occasion afterward. As a solo artist for Capitol Records, she recorded 18 post-Kenton albums. The records, many of them arranged by Pete Rugolo, continued to focus on Mr. Kenton's modernist jazz band sound.         A Wistful 'Something Cool'         Her signature song as a soloist was Bill Barnes's extended, moody soliloquy, ''Something Cool,'' in which her wistful, slightly husky voice, with its very faint vibrato, delivered the dramatic monologue of a boozy, self-deluded barfly. She first recorded it in 1953, and two years later it became the title track of an album, arranged and conducted by Mr. Rugolo, that is widely regarded as a pop-jazz classic. In the early 1960's, Miss Christy and Mr. Rugolo re-created the album, note for note, in stereophonic sound. The singer called the record ''the only thing I've recorded that I'm not unhappy with.''         ''Something Cool'' is the only Christy solo album that remains in print.         In the late 1950's, Miss Christy toured with Ted Heath and with the Kenton band. In the late 1960's, she went into semi-retirement and in 1972 reunited once more with the Kenton band at the Newport Jazz Festival in New York City.         In addition to Mr. Cooper, her husband, she is survived by their daughter, Shay Cooper of Long Beach, Calif., and a brother, Jack Luster of Edwardsville, Ill.       
        Maud Van Cortlandt Oakes, an ethnologist, writer and artist who chronicled the culture of primitive Indian tribes in Guatemala, died Sunday at her home in Carmel, Calif. She was 87 years old. The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, said her conservator, Kay Woolsey.         Maud Van Cortlandt Oakes, an ethnologist, writer and artist who chronicled the culture of primitive Indian tribes in Guatemala, died Sunday at her home in Carmel, Calif. She was 87 years old. The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, said her conservator, Kay Woolsey.         Miss Oakes spent 17 months from late 1945 to early 1947 as the only outsider living in Todos Santos, a remote village in the Guatemalan highlands, where she studied the pre-Columbian roots of the Indians living there.         In 1951 she published two books about her findings, ''Beyond the Windy Place,'' about life among the Indians, and '' The Two Crosses of Todos Santos,'' detailing the survival of Mayan religious ritual.         Miss Oakes was born in Seattle and grew up in Manhattan. She developed an interest in the Indians' past while vacationing on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound.         Her most recent book, ''The Stone Speaks: The Memoir of a Personal Transformation,'' was published in 1987.         Miss Oakes is survived by a niece, Mary Barnard of Olympia, Wash., and a nephew, Alfred Woolsey of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.       
        Fredrika Blair-Hastings, author of a 1986 biography of the dancer Isadora Duncan, died on July 1. She was 71 years old and lived in Carmel, Calif.         Fredrika Blair-Hastings, author of a 1986 biography of the dancer Isadora Duncan, died on July 1. She was 71 years old and lived in Carmel, Calif.         The cause of death was cancer, a family friend, Jeremiah Newton, said.         Born in New York City, Mrs. Blair-Hastings was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville. She began work on the Duncan biography, titled ''Isadora, Portrait of the Artist as a Woman,'' in the 1950's. During the next decade she produced a dance documentary starring Anna Duncan, Julia Levien and Hortense Kooluris, all exponents of Duncan dance.         Mrs. Blair-Hastings is survived by her husband, Jerome Hastings, and a sister, Helen Votichenko, of Scotsdale, Ariz.       
        Frances O'Brien, a portrait artist, died Tuesday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 86 years old.         Frances O'Brien, a portrait artist, died Tuesday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 86 years old.         Her sister, Alyce Martha Cox, said she died of congestive heart failure.         Miss O'Brien did portraits and wood engravings of Irving Berlin, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, William L. Shirer, Winston S. Churchill, Eleanor Roosevelt, Grandma Moses and many others, often for the subjects. For many years, she also did cover portraits for magazines, among them The Saturday Review.         A student of George Luks, she studied at the Louvre and with Hans Hofmann, the impressionist. She was a friend of Georgia O'Keeffe, with whom she traveled about the Southwest.         She was born in Rochester and attended Vassar College, the Corcoran Art School in Washington and the Art Students League in Manhattan and Philadelphia.         Her marriage to George Garfield of Princeton, N.J., ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Brian Garfield of Studio City, Calif.; her sister, who lives in Birmingham, Ala.; and two brothers, Chester O'Brien of Garden City, L.I., and Mortimer O'Brien of Lido Beach, L.I.

        Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Her son, David R. J. Blow, said she had died after suffering a series of strokes this week at the hospital, a geriatric facility that she entered in March. She had lived in various residences for the elderly, mainly in California, since 1983, after residing most of her earlier life in Manhattan.         The versatile Ms. Mannes was a social critic and a critic of radio, television and theater. She worked as a staff writer for the magazine The Reporter from 1952 to 1963. Her writing there included articles, essays and reviews. She even wrote satirical verse, under the pen name ''Sec.''         She did much writing over the years for The New Yorker and for other publications ranging from McCalls to The New York Times, and was the author of several books.         More Than Outspoken         Ms. Mannes's 1958 collection of essays - largely from The Reporter -was contentiously titled ''More in Anger: Some Opinions, Uncensored and Unteleprompted.'' William du Bois, reviewing it in The New York Times, said that ''to call these pages outspoken is putting things mildly.'' The book, he continued, ''is guaranteed to shock you into awareness of its author as an original thinker.''         ''Whether she is writing of the Rheingold girls or the boys in Washington,'' he observed, ''of social-minded mothers and their child victims, of the world of Miltown or the think-room at the United Nations, of the 'half-people' of our automotive age or the heirs of Senator McCarthy, she hews to the line and lets the quips fall where they may.''         For some years, Ms. Mannes was seen often on television, but she was a champion of the written word. In a speech to a gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, she once said, ''No picture on a screen can ever be an adequate substitute for the reporting of a trained observer and an honest writer.''         Marya Mannes was born on Nov. 14, 1904, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her parents were David Mannes and the former Clara Damrosch - founders of the Mannes College of Music.         She grew up in Manhattan, graduating in 1923 from Miss Veltin's School for Girls. Instead of going to college, she went to Europe for two years and studied sculpture, mainly in England.         She went on to do varied writing - including a play, ''Cafe,'' that failed on Broadway in 1930. From 1933 to 1936, she worked for Vogue magazine, as an associate editor and later as feature editor.         Wartime Analyst         During part of World War II, she was an intelligence analyst with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, she did much free-lance writing in addition to her work on The Reporter. Over the decades, 329 articles with her byline were published - 275 of them in The Reporter.         In later years she appeared on various televison programs. The Times television critic Jack Gould wrote in 1961 that ''her sustained acerbity is one of the attractive adornments of contemporary criticism.'' She also lectured across the country.         Her books include ''Out of My Time'' (1971), an autobiography; ''Message From a Stranger'' (1948) and ''They'' (1968) - both novels - and ''Subverse: Rhymes for Our Times'' (1959), a volume of satiric verse.         She was also a co-author of ''Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart'' (1972), a book about divorce. ''The Best of Marya Mannes,'' an anthology of her writing edited by Robert Mottley, was published in 1986.         In 1958 she won the George Polk Memorial Award, one of many honors given for her writing.         Her three marriages - to the set designer Jo Melziener, to Richard A. Blow, an artist, and to Christopher Clarkson, a representative of British companies - ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, who lives in San Francisco.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria. In the 1950's, she made only occasional television appearances.         As she did less acting, she turned to other pursuits. She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS. ANNA         These are among the more than 40 films made by Irene Dunne during her 22-year film career:         Cimarron (1931)         Ann Vickers (1933)         Roberta (1935)         Magnificent Obsession (1935)         Show Boat (1936)         Theodora Goes Wild (1936)         The Awful Truth (1937)         Love Affair (1939)         My Favorite Wife (1940)         A Guy Named Joe (1943)         The White Cliffs of Dover (1944)         Anna and the King of Siam (1946)         Life With Father (1947)         I Remember Mama (1948)         The Mudlark (1950)       
        Marguerite Falkenburg Wagstaff, a painter and a former tennis champion in Brazil, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old. She died of pneumonia, her family said. Mrs. Wagstaff, who was known as Mickey, met her first husband, Eugene Falkenburg, on a tennis court in Spain, where he was chief engineer for Westinghouse.         Marguerite Falkenburg Wagstaff, a painter and a former tennis champion in Brazil, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old. She died of pneumonia, her family said. Mrs. Wagstaff, who was known as Mickey, met her first husband, Eugene Falkenburg, on a tennis court in Spain, where he was chief engineer for Westinghouse. They were married in Barcelona and their daughter, Eugenia, the model and television personality known as Jinx, was born there.         The family moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she won the state tennis championship in 1927. Her sons Tom and Bob each won the United States Junior Championship twice and Bob was the Wimbledon champion in 1948.         After the death of her first husband, she married LeRoy Wagstaff, a retired chief engineer for American Home Products. A prolific artist, she had a studio in Southamption, L.I., where she became known for floral motifs. She produced more than 5,000 paintings that carry her signature, Mic.         She is survived by her daughter, Jinx, of Manhasset, L.I.; sons, Tom, of Stuart, Fla., and Bob, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Miss Seyrig died in a hospital after a long illness, The Associated Press reported.         After her debut in ''Marienbad,'' directed by Alain Resnais, Miss Seyrig appeared in more than 30 films for many of Europe's foremost directors. Among her credits are Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' (1967), Francois Truffaut's ''Stolen Kisses'' (1968) and Luis Bunuel's ''Milky Way'' (1969) and ''Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' (1972).         She also acted in ''The Day of the Jackal'' (1973), ''A Doll's House'' (1973), ''The Black Windmill'' (1974) and ''I Sent a Letter to My Love'' (1981).         By the mid-1970's, Miss Seyrig had become an active feminist.         ''The theater and films,'' she said at the time, ''are very far from women's consciousness about themselves.''         Seeking to correct that situation, she began working with female directors. In 1975, she starred in ''India Song,'' written and directed by Marguerite Duras. In 1976, she made ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' directed by Chantal Akerman.         Miss Seyrig, who began her acting career in the theater, performed on the European stage in ''The Lover'' by Harold Pinter; in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ''Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant,'' and in Beckett's ''Play.'' She appeared on Broadway in 1972 in ''The Little Black Book.''         Miss Seyrig's marriage to the artist Jack Youngerman ended in divorce. She is survived by a son.       
         Joan Brown, an artist and professor of art at the University of California at Berkeley, was killed on Friday in an accident in Proddatura, India. She was 52 years old and lived in San Francisco.         The accident occurred while Ms. Brown, who in recent years was known for her use of imagery from ancient cultures, was installing her work in a reflecting pool at the new Heritage Museum, still under construction at Proddatura. Colleagues at the University of California said a concrete turret from a balcony collapsed and fell on her.         Starting out in the mid-1960's as a figurative painter in the thickly pigmented style of the so-called second-generation Bay Area artists, Ms. Brown gradually lightened her mode of painting and concentrated on imagery drawn from her personal life. A long-distance swimmer who regarded the sport as a means of meditation, she at this time used many images of swimmers in her art. Student of World Cultures         In the early 1970's she began traveling, informally studying world cultures. She drew inspiration for her work from the Egyptian and Hindu religions, and she made obelisks adorned with decorative patterns incorporating symbolic animal and human forms. In recent years, because of political and moral objections to the sale of art, she became involved in public art projects and made an effort to withdraw her work from the market.         Born and brought up in San Francisco, Ms. Brown attended the California School of Fine Arts -- later to become the San Francisco Art Institute -- from 1956 to 1960, and later received a master's degree in fine arts there, in 1962. In 1974 she joined the department of art at Berkeley, where, said Christopher Brown, the chairman of the department, she consistently won the highest rating as a teacher from faculty members and students.         Ms. Brown is survived by her husband, Michael Hebel, and a son, Noel Neri.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Anya Seton, the author of several popular historical and biographical novels, two of which were made into successful films, died on Thursday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She had been ill for several years and died of heart failure, a daughter, Pamela Cottier Forcey, said.         Miss Seton developed a devoted following from the 1940's to the 1970's for her carefully researched and evocative works, two of which, "Dragonwyck" and "Foxfire," were made into successful films. She won critical praise for her attention to the language and life style of the periods she wrote about, but she was frequently faulted for reworking familiar ground.  A First Book at 37         The daughter of a celebrated English author, artist and naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, and an American writer of travel books, Grace Gallatin, Miss Seton did not produce her first successful book until she was 37 years old. She had married the first of her two husbands when she was 18 and raised three children before turning seriously to writing.         She began selling short stories to newspapers -- her first brought her a check for $5 -- and in the late 1930's became interested in the story of Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia, a celebrated beauty of her time who died mysteriously.         Miss Seton decided to apply a fictional treatment to the woman's life and the result was "My Theodosia," published in 1941 and well received by critics and the public.         "Dragonwyck," her second published novel, gained international recognition. A Gothic tale set along the Hudson River in the 1840's, it was serialized by the Ladies' Home Journal, selected by the Dollar Book Club, translated into nine languages and made into a film starring Vincent Price as a feudal overlord who tyrannizes his tenant farmers, kills his wife and takes up with a distant relative, played by Gene Tierney. Role for Vincent Price         The film, released in 1946, was adapted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was his first directorial effort; it established him as a major force in movies and set a villainous style for Mr. Price that he was to repeat many times.         That year Miss Seton followed with "The Turquoise," a novel of the American Southwest in the 1890's, inspired by visits to her father's ranch in New Mexico. Two years later came "The Hearth and the Eagle," set in Marblehead on the Massachusetts coast.         For each of her books, Miss Seton spent a good deal of time getting to know the locale about which she was writing.         "It is impossible for me to describe or 'feel' any place to which I have not been," she once said. "I am inspired by places." "Dragonwyck," "The Turquoise," "The Hearth and the Eagle" and "Foxfire," the latter set in an Arizona ghost town and made into a 1955 film starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, all resulted from visits to places which, Miss Seton said, "suddenly became meaningful." Dark Romances         But her favorite books were her biographical novels. Besides "My Theodosia" these included "Katherine" (1954), the story of the mistress of John of Gaunt; "The Winthrop Woman" (1958), about the niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, and "Devil Water" (1962), "Avalon" (1965) and "Green Darkness" (1973), all of which take place in England and tell of dark romances.         Miss Seton was born in Manhattan and raised in Cos Cob, Conn., where her family had an estate. She was christened Ann, but a family friend, a Sioux chief, gave her the Indian name Anutika, which her family adapted to Anya. She traveled extensively with her parents; by the time she was 13 she had crossed the Atlantic eight times. She had private tutors much of the time but graduated from the Spence School.         Miss Seton was twice married and divorced. Her son, Seton Cottier, died in 1979. She is survived by Mrs. Forcey, who lives in Manhattan, and another daughter, Clemency Chase Coggins of Auburndale, Mass.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Ann Cole Phillips, a painter, died in New York Hospital on Friday night. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia after a long illness, her son, Calman, said.         Ms. Phillips's colorful, vivacious paintings in a semi-abstract style are found in a number of museum collections.         In a tribute to her work, Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1986 established the Ann Cole Phillips Room, a classroom, where students can study the artist's experience from her paintings on the walls around them.         At the height of her career in the 1950's and 1960's, Ms. Phillips's works were compared to Kandinsky, Dufy and Kokoschka. She worked in oils, pastels and lithography.         A native New Yorker, she attended the National Academy of Design and the Arts Students League. She also studied with such masters as Stuart Davis, Jacques Villon and Jose Clemente Orozco.         Besides her son, she is survived by a brother, George Columbus of Lake Worth, Fla., and a granddaughter, Jamey Phillips of New York City.       
         Meg Wohlberg, an illustrator who specialized in images of babies and children, died on Monday at Brookhaven at Lexington, a retirement center in Lexington, Mass. She was 85 years old.         She died of pneumonia, said John R. Whitman of Kirchoff/Wohlberg Inc., which represents illustrators and authors of children's books. The company was founded by Ms. Wohlberg's sister, Helen, who represented the artist at the start of her career.         Ms. Wohlberg grew up in New York City and studied art at the Rochester Atheneum, now the Rochester Institute of Technology, and at the National Academy of Design in New York.         In the 1930's, she illustrated advertisements for products including Ivory Soap, Gerber Baby Food and Johnson & Johnson baby-care products. In the 1950's, 60's and 70's, she illustrated more than 70 children's books, including three pop-up books that she wrote herself, and the "Andy Books," a series published by William Morrow & Company.         Ms. Wohlberg is survived by her husband, Jerome Eisenberg, and her sister, Helen Wohlberg Lambert, both of Lexington.       
         Nan Wood Graham, the model for the tight-lipped farm woman in the painting "American Gothic," died Friday in a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 91 years old.         The 1930 painting by her brother Grant Wood, the regionalist artist, portrays a somber farmer bearing a pitchfork and his equally somber daughter standing before a cottage in Eldon in southeast Iowa. The model for the farmer was Dr. Byron McKeeby, a dentist who lived in the Woods' hometown of Anamosa, Iowa.         The painting initially provoked complaints in Cedar Rapids, where some women protested that Mrs. Graham was poking fun at them with her dour depiction of an Iowa farm woman. One woman wrote to say Mrs. Graham's face would "sour milk."         But the painting, and Mrs. Graham, eventually gained wide popularity in her home state.         If her brother had gone through with his original intention of using another model, the secretarial school graduate said she would have whiled away her days as "the world's worst stenographer."         "Grant made a personality out of me," she once said. "I would have had a very drab life without it."         She was protective of "American Gothic," bringing suit several times against the frequent caricatures and parodies. The painting is kept at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her brother died in 1942.         Born in Anamosa, she attended Polk School and Washington High School in Cedar Rapids. In 1924, she married a real estate investor, Edward Graham. The couple settled in Riverside, Calif., and had no children.         In 1984, widowed and going blind, Mrs. Graham entered a Menlo Park nursing home, ending a lifetime job as historian of her brother's work.       
         Anne Kallem, an editor at the Sterling Publishing Company in Manhattan for 26 years, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, David Boehm, chairman of the publishing company, said.         At her death, she was managing editor emeritus of the company, which publishes nonfiction and reference books. She was born in the Bronx and graduated from Barnard College.         Her huband, Henry Kallem, an artist, died in 1985. She is survived by a son, Matthew Kallem of Rockport, Me.
