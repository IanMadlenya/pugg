         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80. She had suffered several strokes recently, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's. Over the years, she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment, as in 1974, when she asserted that ''there is an undercurrent of resistance'' to integration ''among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination'' -- including in her own district in Brooklyn.         ''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment.         Her slogan was ''unbought and unbossed'' -- in the primary, she had defeated two other candidates, William C. Thompson, whom she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, and Dolly Robinson. ''The party leaders do not like me,'' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time.         But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district -- which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant -- were Democrats. That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer, a leader of the Freedom Rides in the south in the early 1960's, who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines, and Ralph Carrano, who ran as the Conservative candidate.         ''I am an historical person at this point, and I'm very much aware of it,'' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in.         Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House, which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee, an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers.         ''Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there,'' she said in a statement at the time. ''Only nine black people have been elected to Congress, and those nine should be used as effectively as possible.''         She said that the House speaker, John W. McCormack, had told her to ''be a good soldier'' and accept the agriculture assignment. Instead, she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, who handed out the committee assignments. Before long, she was reassigned, first to the Veterans Affairs Committee, and eventually to the Education and Labor Committees.         Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington. ''Our representative democracy is not working,'' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title, ''because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.''         In 1972, when she entered the presidential primaries, she did not expect to capture the Democratic nomination, which ultimately went to George S. McGovern. ''Some see my candidacy as an alternate and others as symbolic or a move to make other candidates start addressing themselves to real issues,'' she said at the time. She did not win a single primary, but in 2002, she said her campaign had been a necessary ''catalyst for change.''         She was also aware of her status as a woman in politics. ''I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black,'' she told The Associated Press in December 1982, shortly before she left Washington to teach at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. ''When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934. Mrs. Chisholm later described the relatives she encountered there as ''a strongly disciplined family unit.''         But she had her own strength, too: ''Mother always said that even when I was 3, I used to get the 6- and 7-year-old kids on the block and punch them and say, 'Listen to me.'''         Her professors listened to her at Brooklyn College, where she won prizes in debating. Some of them told her she should think about politics as a career.         First, though, she taught in a nursery school and earned a master's degree in elementary education at Columbia University. Working as the director of the Friends Day Nursery in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center in Lower Manhattan, she became widely known as an authority on early education and child welfare. She argued that early schooling was essential, saying she knew there were experts who maintained that children's eyes were not developed enough for reading. ''I say baloney, because I learned to read when I was 3 1/2,'' she countered, ''and I learned to write when I was 4.''         From 1959 to 1964, she was an educational consultant in the day care division of the city's bureau of child welfare. But she laid a foundation for her eventual political career, working as a clubhouse volunteer and with organizations like the Bedford-Stuyvesant Political League and the League of Women Voters.         So, when she decided to run for the New York State Assembly in 1964, she said the decision was straightforward: ''The people wanted me.''         She moved on to the House four years later, in the year when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election. A year later, she confirmed her reputation for independence when she endorsed John V. Lindsay, who was running for re-election as mayor of New York         as the Liberal Party candidate.By 1982, the political climate had changed, and Mrs. Chisholm left Washington after seven terms in the House, saying that ''moderate and liberal'' lawmakers were ''running for cover from the new right.'' But she also had personal reasons for deciding not to seek re-election that year: Her second husband, Arthur Hardwick, a Buffalo liquor store owner who had been in the New York State Assembly when Mrs. Chisholm was, had been injured in a car accident. (Her first marriage, to Conrad O. Chisholm, ended in divorce in 1977. Mr. Hardwick died in 1986.)         ''I had been so consumed by my life in politics,'' she said in 1982. ''I had no time for privacy, no time for my husband, no time to play my beautiful grand piano. After he recovered, I decided to make some changes in my life. I truly believe God had a message for me.''         She also sounded frustrated, saying she had been misunderstood for much of her career. She mentioned her hospital visit to George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who built his political career on segregation, after he had been wounded in an assassination attempt in 1972.         ''Black people in my community crucified me,'' she recalled. ''But why shouldn't I go to visit him? Every other presidential candidate was going to see him. He said to me, 'What are your people going to say?' I said: 'I know what they're going to say. But I wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone.' He cried and cried and cried.''         She maintained that her visit had paid off. ''He always spoke well of Shirley Chisholm in the South,'' she said, adding that she had contacted him in 1974, when she was looking for votes for a bill to extend federal minimum-wage provisions to domestic workers. ''Many of the Southerners did not want to make the vote. They came around.''         Mrs. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991 and said in 2002, ''I live a very quiet life.'' She said she spent her time reading biographies -- political biographies.         ''I have faded out of the scene,'' she said.         When she left Washington, she said she did not want to go down in history as ''the nation's first black congresswoman'' or, as she put it, ''the first black woman congressman.''         ''I'd like them to say that Shirley Chisholm had guts,'' she said. ''That's how I'd like to be remembered.''

         Helen Woodhull, a prominent New York jewelry designer whose work echoed ancient and antique themes in silver, gold and precious stones, died on Jan. 29 at her home in the West Village in Manhattan. She was 65.         The death was announced on her Web site, www.woodhulljewelry.com. Andrea Goodman of Lenox, Mass., a friend, said she appeared to have suffered a stroke, and no autopsy was performed.         In the course of nearly 40 years, Ms. Woodhull operated three stores on the Upper East Side, furnished designs for sale at Tiffany, Cartier and Georg Jensen, and for the last 10 years was associated exclusively with James Robinson Inc., a Park Avenue firm dealing mostly in antique jewelry, silver and porcelain. She created more than 300 distinctive pieces of jewelry patterned after Egyptian amulets, Chinese jade or intricate Greek and Roman intaglios carved, incised and engraved into stone or metal. Her work became part of private collections throughout the world.         A native of Morristown, N. J., Helen Woodhull studied at the Parsons School of Design but did not graduate. Instead, according to Ms. Goodman and Joan Boening, the president of James Robinson, she came into her career as much by happenstance as by choice.         After Parsons, she traveled widely and returned awed by history and historical designs, bringing back a trove of collector's pieces that she sold at her first shop, The Leogryph, which she opened near the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1965.         Soon, customers would ask her to mount a newly bought amulet to wear. At first she was reluctant to tamper with ancient objects, but she said she realized that they had been created to adorn an ancient's body in the first place and started creating suitable settings for them.         Eventually she decided to create her own jewelry, assisted for the last 30 years by a master jeweler, John Chirinian, who will continue to work with her designs, Ms. Boening said.         Ms. Woodhull closed the first store in 1968 and designed jewelry for Georg Jensen. She was one of the few young designers working under their own names for Tiffany and Cartier. In the late 1970's she opened her second store on Madison Avenue at 65th Street, and she moved it to Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in 1988.         She closed that store in 1994 but continued to design.         Ms. Woodhull is survived by three sisters, Anne Woodhull of Westfield, N.J., and Charlotte and Katherine Woodhull of Morristown.       
         Beverly Dennis, an actress who played on Broadway, in films and television, most notably on CBS as Red Buttons's wife on ''The Red Buttons Show'' until she was blacklisted in the 1950's, died on Jan. 20 at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was multiple myeloma, her daughter, Amanda Kramer, said.         Ms. Dennis was summoned to Hollywood in 1951 by the director William A. Wellman, who cast her as a lead in ''Westward the Women,'' written by Frank Capra and starring Robert Taylor.         She had met Mr. Buttons at the Actors Studio when the two auditioned unsuccessfully for parts in Tennessee Williams's play ''Camino Real.'' She lost her role as Mr. Buttons's wife in 1952 after the publication ''Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television'' (1950) listed her as belonging to ''subversive organizations,'' probably because she ''signed a few petitions like the rest of us,'' her friend the actress Lee Grant said.         Ms. Dennis was born Beverly Maxine Omensky in Rahway, N.J., on Dec. 12, 1925, the older of two daughters of Charles Omensky, who ran a bar and restaurant, and Marion Mintz Omensky. She grew up in Chicago, where she acted in the theater as a child and briefly attended the University of Chicago.         In 1944 she married Russell Dennis, an actor who was also later blacklisted and then became a medical doctor. He died in 1963. In 1967 she married Jerry Kramer, a businessman, who died in 1983. Her only survivor is her daughter, a musician, singer and composer who plays keyboard in the group the Psychedelic Furs.         After losing her role on ''The Red Buttons Show,'' Ms. Dennis appeared in 1953 in a successful revival of ''Charley's Aunt'' directed by José Ferrer, and continued to support herself doing television commercials. But she decided to switch her profession to psychotherapy, and attended New York University for her bachelor's degree and Columbia University for a master's.         In 1977 she moved her practice to Beverly Hills, where her patients included studio heads, directors, screenwriters and performers. According to her friend the writer Ann Louise Bardach, ''She even turned important people down for treatment because, as she said, 'You can't change character.'''         Correction:  March 5, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on Feb. 14 about Beverly Dennis, an actress who was largely barred from work during the anti-Communist campaigns of the 1950's, misidentified a source of allegations against her. Although she was suspected of Communist sympathies, her name did not appear in ''Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television,'' published in 1950.       
         Former Representative Tillie Fowler, who despite being the most powerful woman in Congress did not run for re-election in 2000 to keep a promise to serve only four terms, died yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 62.         She had suffered a brain hemorrhage two days earlier, a family spokesman, Tom Alexander, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Fowler was vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and No.5 in the House leadership when she left Congress. Her steely intelligence earned her the nickname Steel Magnolia. A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she was known for her expertise on military matters, including vigorous efforts to retain armed services bases in her Florida district.         After leaving Congress in 2001 and joining a law firm, she continued her leadership role in military matters as chairwoman of both the commission that investigated sexual abuse accusations at the United States Air Force Academy and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the secretary of defense.         Ms. Fowler was also on an independent panel that last year investigated the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, attributing the problem to a string of failures that led all the way up the chain of command to the Pentagon.         She was born on Dec. 23, 1942, in Milledgeville, Ga., where her father, Culver Kidd, owned a drug store. Mr. Kidd served for 44 years in the Georgia Legislature.         A photograph in Ms. Fowler's Congressional office showed her at age 7 playing on the desk of Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia. She recalled that she was arguing with him.         She earned a law degree from Emory University, where she also did her undergraduate work. She later worked as a Congressional aide and in the Nixon White House, in consumer affairs. In 1971, she moved to Jacksonville with her husband, Buck Fowler.         She threw herself into volunteer work, then used those contacts to run successfully for the Jacksonville City Council. Elected president of the Council, she had three members arrested in 1989, when they tried to walk out of a meeting, which would have prevented a quorum needed to pass the city budget.         In 1992, she ran for Congress, promising to serve no more than four terms. She received 57 percent of the vote and was unopposed in her next three races.         She got a seat on the Armed Services Committee and was elected co-chairwoman of the Freshman Republican Task Force on Reform. In her second term, she became a deputy whip for the Republicans. In late 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich gave her and Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, the tough assignment of investigating sexual harassment in the Army.         In 1998, Ms. Fowler was elected vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference on the vow that she would serve no longer than two years in the Republican leadership. She filed papers in 1999 to seek re-election, but later decided to keep her initial promise.         She is survived by her husband and her daughters, Tillie Anne, of Washington, and Elizabeth, of California.       
         Col. Mary A. Hallaren, who led the Women's Army Corps into the ranks of the regular military in 1948, died on Feb. 13 in McLean, Va. She was 97.         Her death was announced by the Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., which made her a member in 1996.         Colonel Hallaren commanded the first battalion of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps to serve in Europe, the largest unit of women to serve overseas in World War II. Shortly afterward the word auxiliary was dropped, making it the Women's Army Corps.         She returned from three years in Britain and France with several decorations, including the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and the Croix de Guerre of France. She was then among the officers who helped to overcome strong resistance and to persuade Congress to pass the Women's Armed Services Integration Act.         Signed into law in 1948, the act accepted women into the regular armed services for the first time in United States history. Colonel Hallaren was the first woman to be sworn in as an officer of the Regular Army outside its medical branch.         She was named director of the Women's Army Corps, Regular Army, which gave enlistees a chance to try for any noncombat position and provided for an initial peacetime strength of 18,000. But the rank of colonel was the highest Mary Hallaren attained even under the new system.         She directed the corps during the Korean War until 1953, then had other military assignments. She decided to retire from the military in 1960, well before the Women's Army Corps was finally dissolved and women were formally integrated into all the services in the 1970's without restrictions on rank.         ''The Greatest Generation,'' by Tom Brokaw (Random House, 1998), devoted much of a chapter to Mary Hallaren, who always said she was five feet tall and relied in her job on a no-nonsense presence and a voice that commanded attention.         ''She was called the 'Little Colonel' because of her diminutive stature,'' Mr. Brokaw wrote, ''but when it came to promoting a wider role for women in the military, she was a towering figure, a godmother to the women who continued to struggle to find their places in the male-dominated military establishment.''         After retiring, Colonel Hallaren helped organize Women in Community Service, an outgrowth of the civil rights and women's rights movements and the War Against Poverty of the 1960's. She became its first executive director in 1965 and oversaw its growth into a national organization, known as WICS.         Based in Alexandria, Va., WICS recruits women for the Job Corps and helps women in need with job placements and other services. Colonel Hallaren retired once again in 1978.         Mary Agnes Hallaren was born in Lowell, Mass., and studied there at State Teachers College. Certified as an instructor in remedial reading, she took courses in psychology and education at Harvard and Boston Universities.         She enlisted in the WAAC in 1942 and trained at Officer Candidate School in Fort Des Moines, Iowa. She served as an administrative officer stateside until, by then a captain, she was named commanding officer of the WAAC Separate Battalion in July 1943 and sailed for England and duty with the Eighth Air Force.         She became Air WAC staff director, in charge of WAC personnel assigned to both the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces, and was on duty during the V-1 and V-2 bombardments of London. In March 1945 she was named WAC director for the European Theater, commanding 6,000 members, the largest WAC contingent outside the United States.         Mary Hallaren was teaching junior high school when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and she instinctively followed her brothers to enlist.         ''To me there was no question that women should serve,'' she said later.         She had to stand on her toes to meet the height requirement for enlistment. As she recalled it, she was challenged by a doubtful recruiter but passed muster after she told him, ''You don't have to be six feet tall to have a brain that works.''       
         Maria Schell, an Austrian actress who achieved international fame in Hollywood and became a major star of German-language films, died on Tuesday at her home in Preitenegg, Austria. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure, the mayor of Preitenegg, Franz Kogler, told the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur.         Before she went to Hollywood in the 1950's, Ms. Schell, who was sometimes called ''the blond angel,'' was already a celebrated film figure in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where she was often typecast as a charming girl from the Alps.         Ms. Schell was named best actress at the Cannes film festival in 1954 for her portrayal of a young doctor in ''Die Letzte Brücke'' (''The Last Bridge'') and became internationally known for her role as Grushenka in ''The Brothers Karamazov'' in 1958.         She also appeared in several American movies alongside actors like Gary Cooper, in ''The Hanging Tree'' in 1959, and Marlon Brando, in ''Superman'' in 1978.         Ms. Schell made more than 200 film and television appearances, mostly in German. She was also a prominent stage actress in Austria and Germany.         She was born in Vienna on Jan. 15, 1926, the daughter of a Swiss writer and an Austrian actress. She grew up with three siblings who all went into acting, including Maximilian, her younger brother by four years, who also became a star. In 1938, the family moved to Switzerland, where, in 1942, at the age of 16, she appeared in her first film, the Swiss ''Der Steinbruch'' (''The Quarry'').         Even though her debut was not very successful, Ms. Schell decided to study drama in Zurich. She did not make another movie until she starred in Karl Hartl's Austrian-German 1948 production ''Der Engel mit der Posaune'' (''The Angel With the Trumpet''), the first film to bring her recognition abroad.         In 2002, Ms. Schell made her last public appearance at a presentation of ''Meine Schwester Maria'' (''My Sister Maria''), Maximilian's documentary about her life.         The Austrian film critic Alexander Horwath said she was ''one of the very few stars of postwar German-speaking cinema who had a lasting impact on the international film scene,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         Ms. Schell's two marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was the film director Horst Hächler. Her second marriage, to the Austrian actor Veit Relin, ended after 22 years in 1988. In her last years, Ms. Schell suffered several strokes and led a secluded life at her home in the Alps.         Survivors include Maximilian; her son, Oliver, from her first marriage; and her daughter, Marie-Theres, from her second marriage.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Judith Rossner, a novelist who used crisp, piercing prose to tell of women pushed to often grotesque extremes, most famously in her 1975 book ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was not immediately determined, Rayner Pike, her brother-in-law, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Rossner marshaled intriguing plot twists, precise description and deep empathy to examine women's experiences, addressing situations like pregnancy, sex with strangers and the introduction of a man into a single-parent household.         ''Many of her novels offer a clinical dissection of America's failed marriages and of a culture that has not permitted women to have a life apart from their children and husband,'' said the reference book Contemporary Novelists.         ''Mr. Goodbar,'' the fourth of Ms. Rossner's 10 novels, sold four million copies and in 1977 became a popular movie starring Diane Keaton. The book was based loosely on the 1973 murder of a young schoolteacher in New York who frequented singles bars and could be read as a particularly harrowing caution for the sexually adventurous.         Her seventh novel, ''August,'' published in 1983, was also a best seller. It is about of the complex relationship between a troubled teenager and her psychiatrist, with much of the story told in what seem like transcripts of analytic sessions.         Ms. Rossner's vivid imagination is suggested by the circumstances of the young analysand: Dawn Henley was raised by a lesbian aunt and her lover after Dawn's mother killed herself and her homosexual father drowned in a boating accident. Her foster parents have since separated.         Other fanciful plots include a woman who falls in love with a young man who turns out to be her illegitimate son in ''Emmeline'' (1980), and conjoined twins who marry two women in ''Attachments'' (1977), with the curiosity-inspiring sexual gymnastics hardly ignored.         John Leonard in The New York Times called ''Attachments'' an ''ambitious, disturbing novel by a best-selling author who might have written a trashy book, but decided instead to mess up our minds.''         Judith Perelman was born in Manhattan on March 31, 1935, and grew up in the Bronx. Her father was a textile merchant and her mother a schoolteacher who nurtured her daughter's early interest in writing. At 19 she dropped out of the City College of New York to marry Robert Rossner, a teacher and writer whose name she kept after their divorce in 1972.         She later married and divorced Mordecai Persky. She is survived by her husband Stanley Leff; her children, Daniel and Jean Rossner; her sister, Nancy Pike; and three grandchildren.         Her first marriage broke up after an ill-fated move to a New Hampshire commune, and she returned to New York, where she supported her family with secretarial work, carving out time to write her first three novels. These included ''Any Minute I Can Split,'' finished just before her first divorce.         ''My abiding theme is separations,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1983.         Ms. Rossner became fascinated by the murder of Roseann Quinn, the 27-year-old schoolteacher killed after an encounter in a singles bar, and proposed an article for a special women's issue of Esquire magazine. Esquire's lawyers, fearing the article might jeopardize the accused man's defense, killed the story.         Ms. Rossner, who was recovering from a car accident, found herself pondering the extent to which people are to blame for their own misfortunes. She wrote a one-sentence proposal for a novel on the episode to Simon & Schuster. It read: ''I want to write a book about a schoolteacher who's murdered picking up someone when she's cruising a singles bar.''         According to some published reports, she received a $5,000 advance; others say $10,000. ''Mr. Goodbar'' was sold for $300,000 as a paperback and for $250,000 as a movie, making her financially independent.         Christopher Hawtree, writing in The Guardian of London in 1990, described the book's bleak theme: ''Some of the raunchiest sex scenes ever written lead to a despair that makes death almost inevitable, perhaps even sought.''         Ms. Rossner's other books included ''To the Precipice'' (1966), ''Nine Months in the Life of an Old Maid'' (1969), ''His Little Women'' (1990), ''Olivia'' (1994) and ''Perfidia'' (1997).         Her works repeatedly explored but never explained what she considered an unsettling quandary.         ''It's astonishing what some women will put up with just to have a warm body -- some of the brightest women I know are obsessed with that search,'' she told The Washington Post. ''It's very sad.''       
         Mo Mowlam, the earthy, straight-talking politician who as Britain's Northern Ireland secretary helped negotiate the Good Friday peace settlement in 1998, died Friday morning at a hospice in Canterbury, her family said. She was 55.         Unsteady on her feet at times as a result of radiotherapy treatments for a brain tumor discovered in 1997, Ms. Mowlam fell and hit her head two weeks ago, slipping into a coma from which she never recovered. She left instructions that she not be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of improvement, her family said, and doctors removed her artificial feeding tube earlier this week.         Ms. Mowlam, who retired from politics four years ago, was an unusually blunt and unusually popular member of Parliament. After the radiation treatments caused her hair to fall out, she regularly flung her wig off during negotiations and news conferences, complaining that it made her head itch.         ''I hate the bloody things and have to carry two around with me because I kept losing one,'' she once said.         During the 1998 Labor Party conference, Prime Minister Tony Blair referred to her as ''our Mo'' in passing during his keynote speech, only to have the audience unexpectedly give her a prolonged standing ovation. Although the prime minister joked about it, she later said she thought that he resented being upstaged and felt threatened by her popularity.         In any case, the two fell out politically. He removed her from her Northern Ireland post against her will in 1999, shuffling her to a less important job in the Cabinet Office, and she eventually quit politics, growing increasingly disillusioned with his New Labor government.         But as tributes poured in from across the political spectrum on Friday, the prime minister called Ms. Mowlam ''one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered'' and said she was ''great company, utterly irreverent, full of life and fun.''         ''It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom,'' he said, ''and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peacemaking could flourish.''         Marjorie Mowlam was born in 1949 and brought up in Coventry. She had a tough childhood -- her family was invariably short of money, and her father was an alcoholic. She came to politics late, at the age of 38, after working as a college lecturer.         She decided to run for Parliament just five days before the deadline to register as a candidate for the 1987 election and won a seat in Redcar, on the North Sea coast. Immensely charismatic, bawdy, unpretentious and funny, she became an integral part of Mr. Blair's rejuvenated Labor Party, helping lead it into power in the 1997 general election.         She was quickly made Northern Ireland secretary, with a mission to help effect a peace settlement for the warring province. She visited paramilitary prisoners at Maze Prison to win them over to the idea of peace.         But even as she worked hard to build good relations with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, which wants Northern Ireland to become part of the Irish Republic, she alienated unionists, who want it to remain united with Britain and who accused her of being too sympathetic to the republican cause.         She complained that she was increasingly marginalized during the talks that eventually led to the peace agreement, saying she was no more than ''a tea lady.'' After she was removed from the Northern Ireland post, her criticism of the government grew louder. When she finally left politics, she said it had become ''harder and harder to defend what the Labor government is doing.''         In 2002 she published a memoir, ''Momentum,'' in which, among other things, she stated that Mr. Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were not getting along.         She is survived by her husband, Jon Norton, and two stepchildren.         Her plain-spokenness extended to shouting and swearing at intransigent politicians from both sides in Northern Ireland, invariably men, and invariably tough combatants. She was once overhead saying to Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, ''Bloody well get on and do it; otherwise I'll head-butt you!''       
         Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights lawyer who fought nearly every important civil rights case for two decades and then became the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, died yesterday at NYU Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Isolde Motley, her daughter-in-law.         Judge Motley was the first black woman to serve in the New York State Senate, as well as the first woman to be Manhattan borough president, a position that guaranteed her a voice in running the entire city under an earlier system of local government called the Board of Estimate.         Judge Motley was at the center of the firestorm that raged through the South in the two decades after World War II, as blacks and their white allies pressed to end the segregation that had gripped the region since Reconstruction. She visited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in jail, sang freedom songs in churches that had been bombed, and spent a night under armed guard with Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader who was later murdered.         But her métier was in the quieter, painstaking preparation and presentation of lawsuits that paved the way to fuller societal participation by blacks. She dressed elegantly, spoke in a low, lilting voice and, in case after case, earned a reputation as the chief courtroom tactician of the civil rights movement.         Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and other staunch segregationists yielded, kicking and screaming, to the verdicts of courts ruling against racial segregation. These huge victories were led by the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, for which Judge Motley, Jack Greenberg, Robert Carter and a handful of other underpaid, overworked lawyers labored.         In particular, she directed the legal campaign that resulted in the admission of James H. Meredith to the University of Mississippi in 1962. She argued 10 cases before the United States Supreme Court and won nine of them.         Judge Motley won cases that ended segregation in Memphis restaurants and at whites-only lunch counters in Birmingham, Ala. She fought for King's right to march in Albany, Ga. She played an important role in representing blacks seeking admission to the Universities of Florida, Georgia Alabama and Mississippi and Clemson College in South Carolina.         She helped write briefs in the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and in later elementary-school integration cases.         Judge Motley was a tall, gracious and stately woman whose oft-stated goal was as simple as it was sometimes elusive: dignity for all people. Her personal approach was also dignified. When a reporter wrote that she had demanded some action by the court, she soon corrected him:         ''What do you mean 'I demanded the court'? You don't demand, you pray for relief or move for some action.''         Charlayne Hunter-Gault, whose admission to the University of Georgia was engineered by Mrs. Motley's legal finesse, described her courtroom cunning.         ''Mrs. Motley's style could be deceptive, often challenging a witness to get away with one lie after another without challenging them,'' she wrote in her book ''In My Place,'' published in 1992. ''It was as if she would lull them into an affirmation of their own arrogance, causing them to relax as she appeared to wander aimlessly off into and around left field, until she suddenly threw a curveball with so much skill and power it would knock them off their chair.''         As a black woman practicing law in the South, she endured gawking and more than a few physical threats. A local paper in Jackson, Miss., derided her as ''the Motley woman.''         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York at the urging of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, a Democrat, and with the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a Republican. The opposition of Southern senators like James O. Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, was beaten back, and her appointment was confirmed. She became chief judge of the district in 1982 and senior judge in 1986.         Constance Baker was born on Sept. 14, 1921, in New Haven, the ninth of 12 children. Her parents came from the tiny Caribbean island Nevis at the beginning of the 20th century.         Her father worked as a chef for various Yale University student organizations, including Skull and Bones. She attended local schools in what was then an overwhelmingly white community.         One of her first experiences with discrimination came at 15, when she was turned away from a public beach because she was black.         She read books dealing with black history and became president of the local N.A.A.C.P. youth council. She decided that she wanted to be a lawyer, but her family lacked money to send their many children to college. After high school, she struggled to earn a living as a domestic worker.         When she was 18, she made a speech at local African-American social center that was heard by Clarence W. Blakeslee, a white businessman and philanthropist who sponsored the center. He was impressed and offered to finance her education.         She decided to attend Fisk University, a black college in Nashville, partly because she had never been to the South. In Nashville, she encountered a rigidly segregated society, and brought her parents a poignant souvenir: a sign that read ''Colored Only.''         After a year and a half at Fisk, she transferred to New York University. After graduation in 1943, she entered Columbia Law School, where she began to work as a volunteer at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, an affiliate of the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People that Mr. Marshall and his mentor, Charles Houston, had created in 1939.         After she graduated in 1946, she began to work full time for the civil rights group at a salary of $50 a week. She worked first on housing cases, fighting to break the restrictive covenants that barred blacks from white neighborhoods.         Also in 1946, she married Joel Wilson Motley Jr., a New York real estate broker. He survives her, as does their son, Joel III, who lives in Scarborough, N.Y.; three grandchildren; her brother Edmund Baker of Florida; and her sisters Edna Carnegie, Eunice Royster and Marian Green, all of New Haven.         Mr. Marshall had no qualms about sending her into the tensest racial terrain, precisely because she was a woman. She said she believed that was why she was assigned to the Meredith case in 1961.         ''Thurgood says that the only people who are safe in the South are the women -- white and Negro,'' she said in an interview with Pictorial Living, the magazine of The New York Journal-American, in 1965. ''I don't know how he's got that figured. But, so far, I've never been subjected to any violence.''         Mr. Meredith's admission to the University of Mississippi in September 1962 was a major victory for the civil rights movement. Mrs. Motley worked on the case for 18 months before Mr. Meredith's name was even seen in the papers.         She made 22 trips to Mississippi as the case dragged on. Judge Motley once called the day Mr. Meredith accepted his diploma in 1963 the most thrilling in her life.         She said her greatest professional satisfaction came with the reinstatement of 1,100 black children in Birmingham who had been expelled for taking part in street demonstrations in the spring of 1963.         In February 1964, Mrs. Motley's high-level civil rights profile drew her into politics. A Democratic State Senate candidate from the Upper West Side was ruled off the ballot because of an election-law technicality. She accepted the nomination on the condition that it would not interfere with her N.A.A.C.P. work and handily defeated a Republican to become the first black woman elected to the State Senate. She was re-elected that November.         She remained in the job until February 1965, when she was chosen by unanimous vote of the City Council to fill a one-year vacancy as Manhattan borough president. In citywide elections nine months later, she was re-elected to a full four-year term with the endorsement of the Democratic, Republican and Liberal Parties.         As borough president, she drew up a seven-point program for the revitalization of Harlem and East Harlem, securing $700,000 to plan for those and other underprivileged areas of the city.         After becoming a federal judge in 1966, Judge Motley ruled in many cases, but her decisions often reflected her past. She decided on behalf of welfare recipients, low-income Medicaid patients and a prisoner who claimed to have been unconstitutionally punished by 372 days of solitary confinement, whom she awarded damages.         She continued to try cases after she took senior status. Her hope as a judge was that she would change the world for the better, she said.         ''The work I'm doing now will affect people's lives intimately,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977, ''it may even change them.''         Correction:  October 5, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, misstated the given name of her surviving brother and the means by which she was named to fill a vacancy as Manhattan borough president. Her brother is Edward Baker, not Edmund; she took office by a unanimous vote of the City Council members from Manhattan, not of the Council as a whole. The article also misstated part of the name of the civil rights organization that was then the parent of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for which Judge Motley began volunteer work in 1943. It is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- not National Organization.       
         Mary Lee Settle, a master of historical fiction who recreated time and place with visceral, almost fanatical accuracy, died Tuesday at a hospice in Charlottesville, Va. She was 87 and made her home in Charlottesville.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Christopher Weathersbee.         Ms. Settle, who was a National Book Award winner and the author of the novels known as ''The Beulah Quintet,'' explained her research process in an introduction to ''O Beulah Land,'' the first in an interconnected five-book saga that spanned three centuries, from Cromwell's England to what Ms. Settle called ''the feudal coal culture'' of West Virginia, her native state.         To inform her book, she wrote, it was necessary to ''let the past become a present, let it fall beyond intelligence into reliving, which is true sensuous recall, where dreams come from with all their fears and future hopes of things long past.''         ''The Beulah Quintet'' novels, written between 1956 and 1982, were linked by an exploration of the ways American concepts of personal freedom evolved, and began with the journey of former English prisoners to West Virginia's Kanawha Valley (called Beulah in the novels). For instance, the plot of ''The Scapegoat'' (1980), the fourth volume, unfolds during a violent 1912 confrontation between miners and owners. The other books are ''Know Nothing'' (1960), ''Prisons'' (written in 1973, years after ''O Beulah Land,'' but labeled Book I because the action takes place earlier in history) and ''The Killing Ground'' (1982).         But Ms. Settle's work ranged far beyond her birthplace, geographically and otherwise. In 1978, she received the National Book Award for ''Blood Tie,'' the story of American and British expatriates in Turkey. She had been living there, well aware of the sociocultural influences that traveled both ways between natives and outsiders. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard wrote that the American and British characters were ''like so many Typhoid Marys, carrying the disease of change, change as a fever, wherever they go.''         If Ms. Settle's work was never wildly fashionable -- possibly because ''I don't write about being vaguely unhappy in Connecticut,'' she once said -- that allowed it to age well.         In her historical novels, readers could be assured that the characters spoke pretty much the way people in their time and place spoke, or as close to it as was humanly possible to determine. Ms. Settle had been known to spend months on end reading letters and other accounts from the period she was researching without taking a single note. ''She believed that the key to understanding these people was in their words,'' said Starling Lawrence, her editor at W.W. Norton. So she simply immersed herself in them.         ''Ye're no more nor 19, if that,'' a character in ''O Beulah Land'' tells a new acquaintance. In ''I, Roger Williams: Fragment of an Autobiography'' (2001), Williams has low opinions of ''brabble'' and ''fribbling matters.''         Ms. Settle, always sympathetic to other writers and an advocate of their causes, decided that authors should have their own awards program, with the winners chosen by fellow authors. That way the selections would be independent of publishing industry influences. The idea turned into the PEN/Faulkner award, which began in 1980 and which, with a $15,000 grand prize, has become the largest of the country's major fiction awards.         Mary Lee Settle was born on July 29, 1918, in Charleston, W.Va., the daughter of Joseph Edward and Rachel Tompkins Settle. Her father was a civil engineer in charge of worker safety at coal mines. That industry ran into financial difficulties even before the Depression. More than a half century later, Ms. Settle recalled ''the brave Christmas dinner of 1930'' when she and her parents were living with her grandmother ''because the bottom had dropped out of the coal business.'' Ms. Settle attended Sweet Briar College in Virginia for two years, then began a career as a fashion model. ''I took for granted the kind of looks that other women envied and that I treated with a slight contempt,'' she wrote at the age of 69, contemplating the advisability of face-lifts. She is also said to have been given a screen test, along with half of Hollywood, for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.''         During World War II she went to England and served in the women's branch of the Royal Air Force, an experience she recounted later in ''All the Brave Promises: Memories of Aircraft Woman Second Class 2146391.''         In New York after the war, she worked as a magazine editor, but briefly. She often told the story of how, while going over a Harper's Bazaar fashion layout that had been inspired by ''Wuthering Heights,'' she noticed in some notes that Emily Brontë had died at 30. It was then, she said, that she decided she had better start on the books she was planning to write, walked into the boss's office and resigned.         Nine years later her first book was published. ''The Love Eaters'' (1954) was about a small-town theater company. She went on to write 22 books, the most recent being ''Spanish Recognitions'' (2004), a travel memoir.         Ms. Settle traveled extensively and lived abroad at various periods in her life for various reasons. In the late 1960's she fulfilled a promise that many of her fellow Democrats had made to themselves. In 1987, she explained it to Nancy Carol Joyner of Western Carolina University: ''I said if Nixon was elected president I was going back to Europe. He was, and I did.''         Ms. Settle married three times and divorced twice. Her first two husbands, Rodney Weathersbee (1939-46) and Douglas Newton (1946-56), were British. In 1978, when she was 60, she married William L. Tazewell, an American writer and historian. He died in 1998.         Like many authors, she had an academic career as well. Her longest association was with Bard College, where she was an associate professor from 1965 to 1976. She also taught at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she lived on and off throughout her life.         Ms. Settle never let age slow her writing career. ''Spanish Reflections'' was based on a trip that she took in her early 80's, after finishing ''I, Roger Williams.''         At the time of her death she was working on ''Tom: An Appreciation of Thomas Jefferson,'' an ''imagined biography'' focusing on Jefferson's youth. Her son said it was not yet clear whether the book was in shape for publication.         In addition to her son, now living in Charlottesville, she is survived by a granddaughter, Beatrice Weathersbee, of Portsmouth, N.H.; a grandson, Nicolas Weathersbee, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and four great-grandchildren.         Just days before her death, Ms. Settle discussed her memorial service with Mr. Lawrence, her editor. In a conversation that inspired her to give an impromptu recitation of a Keats sonnet (''When I have fears that I may cease to be''), she told him that she would like to have the beginning of the Gospel of St. John read. ''If you're a writer, you can see the appeal of that text,'' Mr. Lawrence said.         The first words of the first verse of the Book of John are ''In the beginning was the word.''       
         Dr. Margot S. Kruskall, a Harvard hematologist and an expert on blood banks who was an early advocate for patients' donations of their own blood before surgery, a practice propelled by the spread of AIDS in the 1980's, died on Aug. 27 at her home in Dover, Mass. She was 56. The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         In 1982, when Dr. Kruskall headed Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank and hematology laboratory in Boston, she established a program for patients to donate and store their own blood, in large part stemming from concerns about hepatitis infections.         The practice, known as autologous donation, was known for more than a century, although it had never before been instituted on a wide scale. Dr. Kruskall and others at Beth Israel set up a system to label the blood, decided what surgical procedures were best served by it and created an inventory system.         The program's timing was propitious, coming just as H.I.V. was being recognized as a blood-borne virus.         When similar programs appeared nationwide, Dr. Kruskall and others analyzed their effectiveness and published the findings in the journal Transfusion in 1986. Autologous donations have since declined, largely because of closer controls on blood banks and the application of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells and markedly reduces the need for blood transfusions.         Dr. Justine M. Carr, a hematologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a former director of the hematology lab there, said Dr. Kruskall began to research the viability of erythropoietin in the 1980's, helping to prove its effectiveness and determine dosages.         She and other scientists later developed a blood test to detect erythropoietin, which has been used by athletes to reduce muscle fatigue and illicitly enhance performance.         More recently, Dr. Kruskall pursued research to develop a kind of universal red blood cell that could be safely infused, regardless of a patient's blood type. She worked with Type B blood, modifying its red cells with enzymes to react like the cells in blood Type O, which can be received by most patients.         Margot Sheffield Kruskall was born in New York City. She earned an undergraduate degree from Jackson College of Tufts University, and her medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1974.         She arrived at Beth Israel in 1976 and remained for the rest of her career, ultimately serving as director of the division of laboratory and transfusion medicine. Harvard appointed her an associate professor of medicine in 1992 and a professor of pathology in 2002.         Dr. Kruskall was an associate editor of Transfusion.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Dr. Stephen Kruskall, co-chairman of the emergency room at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.; a son, Peter; two daughters, Gillian and Lauren, all of Dover; and by a sister, Denni Day of Rochester.       
         Vivian Malone Jones, who on a blisteringly hot June day in 1963 became one of two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama after first being barred at the door by the defiant governor, George C. Wallace, died yesterday in Atlanta. She was 63.         The cause was a stroke, her sister Sharon Malone told The Associated Press.         Her entrance to the university came as the civil rights struggle raged across the South. On June 12, the day after Ms. Jones and James Hood were escorted into the university by federalized National Guard troops, the civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot to death in Jackson, Miss.         On May 30, 1965, Ms. Jones became the first black to graduate from the University of Alabama in its 134 years of existence, earning a degree in business management with a B-plus average.         The performance of Governor Wallace, who stood at the doorway of Foster Auditorium flanked by state troopers, fulfilled a campaign pledge stop integration at ''the schoolhouse door.''         But historians have written that his defiance was scripted and came with a promise to federal authorities that he would be brief and would soon comply.         At the time, The Tuscaloosa News wrote contemptuously that the governor ''squeezed every suspenseful moment of drama from the occasion.''         The students waited in a car, as Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, deputy attorney general of the United States, avoided a direct confrontation. He said to Mr. Wallace: ''From the outset, Governor, all of us have known that the final chapter of this history will be the admission of these students.''         Only after the federalized guard troops arrived, four and a half hours after Mr. Wallace's initial refusal, were the students admitted. Mr. Wallace read a second statement challenging the constitutionality of the court order, then briskly left.         The students entered Foster Hall, registered, went to their dormitories, ate in the cafeteria and experienced no further incidents that day.         The first African-American at the university, founded in 1831, was Autherine Lucy, who arrived in February 1956 to pursue a master's degree in library science. But after experiencing three days of threats Ms. Lucy was suspended, ostensibly for her own safety, and later expelled.         More than 35 years later, she earned a master's degree in elementary education at Alabama.         Mr. Hood left the university after two months, saying he wanted to avoid ''a complete mental and physical breakdown.'' He transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit and graduated with a bachelor's degree, having studied political science and police administration.         Mr. Hood. returned to the University of Alabama and earned a doctorate in higher education in 1997.         Vivian Juanita Malone grew up in Mobile, Ala., where she was a member of the National Honor Society in high school.         She earned a bachelor's degree at Alabama A&M, a predominantly black university, but it lost its accreditation. To get an accredited degree, she applied to the University of Alabama's School of Commerce and Business Administration and was admitted as a junior.         One night at midnight, someone knocked on her dormitory door and told her there was a bomb threat. No bomb materialized, but that November, there were three bomb blasts at the university, one of them four blocks from her dormitory.         After Mr. Evers was killed, Ms. Jones said she felt even more determined not to give up.         ''I decided not to show any fear and went to classes that day,'' she said in an interview with The Post Standard of Syracuse in 2004.         In the same interview, she said one of her strongest memories of Alabama was that she often smiled at white students, but got no response.         The university hired a driver for her, a student at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa named Mack Jones. They later married, and he became an obstetrician. He died last year.         Ms. Jones is survived by her son, Michael A. Jones; her daughter, Monica Jones Shareef; three brothers; four sisters; and two grandchildren.         After graduating from Alabama, Ms. Jones worked for the United States Justice Department in its civil rights division. She also worked at the Environmental Protection Agency as director of civil rights and urban affairs and director of environmental justice before retiring in 1996 to sell life insurance.         In 1996, former Governor Wallace presented the Lurleen B. Wallace Award for Courage, named for his late wife, to Ms. Jones. He told her that he made a mistake 33 years earlier and that he admired her. They discussed forgiveness.         In a speech to University of Alabama graduates in 2000, Ms. Jones suggested one lesson that might be taken from her historic experience: ''You must always be ready to seize the moment.''       
         Shirley Horn, a jazz singer and pianist who drew audiences close with a powerfully confidential, vibratoless delivery, died yesterday at a nursing home in Cheverly, Md. She was 71. Her death was announced by Regina Joskow, vice president of publicity at the Verve Music Group, Ms. Horn's label.         Ms. Horn was a unique singer, with one of the slowest deliveries in jazz and a very unusual way of phrasing, putting stress on certain words and letting others slip away. She cherished her repertory, making audiences feel that she was cutting through to the stark truths of songs like ''Here's to Life'' and ''You Won't Forget Me.'' She wanted things just so: she stuck with her drummer, Steve Williams, for 23 years, and her bassist, Charles Ables -- who died in 2002 -- for 33.         She lived all her life in and around Washington, often performing close to home to be near her family. But over the last two decades she enjoyed a quietly expanding revival of the concert and club career she had begun in the 1950's, and she became a star in the jazz world.         When she was 4, her mother had her start piano lessons. In her teens she won a scholarship to Juilliard, but it was decided that living in New York would cost the family too much money; she studied classical music at Howard University in Washington instead.         She recalled that at 17, while she was playing classical music at a restaurant in Washington, a man appeared in front of her with a four-foot-tall turquoise teddy bear. ''If you sing 'Melancholy Baby,''' he said, ''I'll give you this bear.'' She did, and he did.         At the time Ms. Horn was shy and largely focused on classical music, but she often cited this as the moment when it dawned on her that if she overcame her reluctance to sing and to play jazz in public, she might be able to make a living at it. About her transition from classical to jazz, she liked to say: ''I loved Rachmaninoff, but then Oscar Peterson became my Rachmaninoff. And Ahmad Jamal became my Debussy.''         From 1954, she led her own jazz trio in Washington. In 1960 she recorded her first album, ''Embers and Ashes,'' for a small label called Stere-o-Craft. It was not widely heard, but Miles Davis heard it, and a year later he tracked down her telephone number in Washington and invited her to open for him at the Village Vanguard in New York. That exposure, plus the help of the jazz agent and manager John Levy, helped get her a contract with Mercury Records.         Mercury signed Ms. Horn as a singer, not a singer-pianist. Although some of the great piano-playing accompanists, including Hank Jones and Jimmy Jones, were hired to play on her records, and although ''Loads of Love,'' from 1962, showcased her voice well -- she could sound like a quieter, subtler version of Dinah Washington -- the situation made her uncomfortable.         By the mid-1960's she had stopped touring and decided to restrict her performing to the Washington and Baltimore areas so she could spend more time at home raising her daughter, Rainy. From 1963 to 1978 she made only two records -- ''Travelin' Light'' for ABC-Paramount and ''Where Are You Going?'' for Perception. From 1978 to 1984, she recorded for the Danish label Steeplechase and slowly came back into the awareness of jazz fans.         In 1982, she played her first New York performance in more than 15 years, at Michael's Pub, and in 1986 she was signed by Verve. The company built up her career all over again over the course of 11 albums, including ''You Won't Forget Me'' (1990), which featured guest appearances by Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis; ''I Remember Miles'' (1998), which won a Grammy Award; and a few that featured string sections.         Ms. Horn's survivors include her husband, Sheppard Deering, of Upper Marlboro, Md.; her daughter, Rainy Smith, of Maryland; and several grandchildren.         Ms. Horn had been fighting breast cancer for some time when complications of diabetes led to the amputation of her right foot in 2002. For a few years she performed sitting in a chair and facing the audience directly, away from the piano, which was played by George Mesterhazy. But in her final performances in New York, a two-week stretch at Le Jazz Au Bar that started last Dec. 30, she was back at the piano again, with the help of a prosthetic device that helped her to use the instrument's sustain pedal.         Three of those performances will be released in October on a Verve anthology of her work, ''But Beautiful: The Best of Shirley Horn.''       
         Rosa Parks, a black seamstress whose refusal to relinquish her seat to a white man on a city bus in Montgomery, Ala., almost 50 years ago grew into a mythic event that helped touch off the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's, died yesterday at her home in Detroit. She was 92 years old.         Her death was confirmed by Dennis W. Archer, the former mayor of Detroit.         For her act of defiance, Mrs. Parks was arrested, convicted of violating the segregation laws and fined $10, plus $4 in court fees. In response, blacks in Montgomery boycotted the buses for nearly 13 months while mounting a successful Supreme Court challenge to the Jim Crow law that enforced their second-class status on the public bus system.         The events that began on that bus in the winter of 1955 captivated the nation and transformed a 26-year-old preacher named Martin Luther King Jr. into a major civil rights leader. It was Dr. King, the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, who was drafted to head the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization formed to direct the nascent civil rights struggle.         ''Mrs. Parks's arrest was the precipitating factor rather than the cause of the protest,'' Dr. King wrote in his 1958 book, ''Stride Toward Freedom. ''The cause lay deep in the record of similar injustices.''         Her act of civil disobedience, what seems a simple gesture of defiance so many years later, was in fact a dangerous, even reckless move in 1950's Alabama. In refusing to move, she risked legal sanction and perhaps even physical harm, but she also set into motion something far beyond the control of the city authorities. Mrs. Parks clarified for people far beyond Montgomery the cruelty and humiliation inherent in the laws and customs of segregation.         That moment on the Cleveland Avenue bus also turned a very private woman into a reluctant symbol and torchbearer in the quest for racial equality and of a movement that became increasingly organized and sophisticated in making demands and getting results.         ''She sat down in order that we might stand up,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said yesterday in an interview from South Africa. ''Paradoxically, her imprisonment opened the doors for our long journey to freedom.''         Even in the last years of her life, the frail Mrs. Parks made appearances at events and commemorations, saying little but lending the considerable strength of her presence. In recent years, she suffered from dementia, according to medical records released during a lawsuit over the use of her name by the hip-hop group OutKast.Over the years myth tended to obscure the truth about Mrs. Parks. One legend had it that she was a cleaning woman with bad feet who was too tired to drag herself to the rear of the bus. Another had it that she was a ''plant'' by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         The truth, as she later explained, was that she was tired of being humiliated, of having to adapt to the byzantine rules, some codified as law and others passed on as tradition, that reinforced the position of blacks as something less than full human beings.         ''She was fed up,'' said Elaine Steele, a longtime friend and executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development. ''She was in her 40's. She was not a child. There comes a point where you say, 'No, I'm a full citizen, too. This is not the way I should be treated.'''         In ''Stride Toward Freedom,'' Dr. King wrote, ''Actually no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, 'I can take it no longer.'''         Mrs. Parks was very active in the Montgomery N.A.A.C.P. chapter, and she and her husband, Raymond, a barber, had taken part in voter registration drives.         At the urging of an employer, Virginia Durr, Mrs. Parks had attended an interracial leadership conference at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn., in the summer of 1955. There, she later said, she ''gained strength to persevere in my work for freedom, not just for blacks but for all oppressed people.''         But as she rushed home from her job as a seamstress at a department store on Dec. 1, 1955, the last thing on her mind was becoming ''the mother of the civil rights movement,'' as many would later describe her. She had to send out notices of the N.A.A.C.P.'s coming election of officers. And she had to prepare for the workshop that she was running for teenagers that weekend.         ''So it was not a time for me to be planning to get arrested,'' she said in an interview in 1988.         On Montgomery buses, the first four rows were reserved for whites. The rear was for blacks, who made up more than 75 percent of the bus system's riders. Blacks could sit in the middle rows until those seats were needed by whites. Then the blacks had to move to seats in the rear, stand or, if there was no room, leave the bus. Even getting on the bus presented hurdles: If whites were already sitting in the front, blacks could board to pay the fare but then they had to disembark and re-enter through the rear door.         For years blacks had complained, and Mrs. Parks was no exception. ''My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest,'' she said. ''I did a lot of walking in Montgomery.''         After a confrontation in 1943, a driver named James Blake ejected Mrs. Parks from his bus. As fate would have it, he was driving the Cleveland Avenue bus on Dec. 1, 1955. He demanded that four blacks give up their seats in the middle section so a lone white man could sit. Three of them complied.         Recalling the incident for ''Eyes on the Prize,'' a 1987 public television series on the civil rights movement, Mrs. Parks said: ''When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'''         Her arrest was the answer to prayers for the Women's Political Council, which was set up in 1946 in response to the mistreatment of black bus riders, and for E.D. Nixon, a leading advocate of equality for blacks in Montgomery.         Blacks had been arrested, and even killed, for disobeying bus drivers. They had begun to build a case around a 15-year-old girl's arrest for refusing to give up her seat, and Mrs. Parks had been among those raising money for the girl's defense. But when they learned that the girl was pregnant, they decided that she was an unsuitable symbol for their cause.         Mrs. Parks, on the other hand, was regarded as ''one of the finest citizens of Montgomery -- not one of the finest Negro citizens -- but one of the finest citizens of Montgomery,'' Dr. King said.         While Mr. Nixon met with lawyers and preachers to plan an assault on the Jim Crow laws, the women's council distributed 35,000 copies of a handbill that urged blacks to boycott the buses on Monday, Dec. 5, the day of Mrs. Parks's trial.         ''Don't ride the buses to work, to town, to school, or anywhere on Monday,'' the leaflet said.         On Sunday, Dec. 4, the announcement was made from many black pulpits, and a front-page article in The Montgomery Advertiser, a black newspaper, further spread the word.         Some blacks rode in carpools that Monday. Others rode in black-owned taxis that charged only the bus fare, 10 cents. But most black commuters -- 40,000 people -- walked, some more than 20 miles.         At a church rally that night, blacks unanimously agreed to continue the boycott until these demands were met: that they be treated with courtesy, that black drivers be hired, and that seating in the middle of the bus go on a first-come basis.         The boycott lasted 381 days, and in that period many blacks were harassed and arrested on flimsy excuses. Churches and houses, including those of Dr. King and Mr. Nixon, were dynamited.         Finally, on Nov. 13, 1956, in Browder v. Gayle, the Supreme Court outlawed segregation on buses. The court order arrived in Montgomery on Dec. 20; the boycott ended the next day. But the violence escalated: snipers fired into buses as well as Dr. King's home, and bombs were tossed into churches and into the homes of ministers.         Early the next year, the Parkses left Montgomery for Hampton, Va., largely because Mrs. Parks had been unable to find work, but also because of disagreements with Dr. King and other leaders of the city's struggling civil rights movement.         Later that year, at the urging of her younger brother, Sylvester, Mrs. Parks, her husband and her mother, Leona McCauley, moved to Detroit. Mrs. Parks worked as a seamstress until 1965, when Representative John Conyers Jr. hired her as an aide for his Congressional office in Detroit. She retired in 1988.         ''There are very few people who can say their actions and conduct changed the face of the nation,'' Mr. Conyers said yesterday in a statement, ''and Rosa Parks is one of those individuals.''         Mrs. Parks's husband, Raymond, died in 1977. There are no immediate survivors.         In the last decade, Mrs. Parks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. But even as she remained an icon of textbooks , her final years were troubled. She was hospitalized after a 28-year-old man beat her in her home and stole $53. She had problems paying her rent, relying on a local church for support until last December, when her landlord stopped charging her rent.         Rosa Louise McCauley was born in Tuskegee, Ala., on Feb. 4, 1913, the elder of Leona and James McCauley's two children. Although the McCauleys were farmers, Mr. McCauley also worked as a carpenter and Mrs. McCauley as a teacher.         Rosa McCauley attended rural schools until she was 11 years old, then Miss White's School for Girls in Montgomery. She attended high school at the Alabama State Teachers College, but dropped out to care for her ailing grandmother. It was not until she was 21 that she earned a high school diploma.         Shy and soft-spoken, Mrs. Parks often appeared uncomfortable with the near-beatification bestowed upon her by blacks, who revered her as a symbol of their quest for dignity and equality. She would say that she hoped only to inspire others, especially young people, ''to be dedicated enough to make useful lives for themselves and to help others.''         She also expressed fear that since the birthday of Dr. King became a national holiday, his image was being watered down and he was being depicted as merely a ''dreamer.''         ''As I remember him, he was more than a dreamer,'' Mrs. Parks said. ''He was an activist who believed in acting as well as speaking out against oppression.''         She would laugh in recalling some of her experiences with children whose curiosity often outstripped their grasp of history: ''They want to know if I was alive during slavery times. They equate me along with Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth and ask if I knew them.''         Correction:  October 26, 2005, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a front-page obituary of Rosa Parks in late editions yesterday referred incorrectly to The Montgomery Advertiser, which printed a front-page article on Dec. 4, 1955, that publicized a boycott of Montgomery's buses the next day. It is a general-interest newspaper, not a black one.       
         Constance Keene, a pianist and teacher whose recordings of the Romantic keyboard repertory were highly regarded, died on Dec. 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84, and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by Debra Kinzler, the spokeswoman for the Manhattan School of Music, where Ms. Keene has taught since 1969. She also joined the school's board of trustees in 1997.         Ms. Keene maintained a fairly low-key performing career in recent years, but her influence as a teacher and occasional writer on keyboard topics for Clavier magazine was considerable. She was a juror at several major competitions, and in addition to her work at the Manhattan School, she gave master classes in Europe, Asia and South Africa.         Early in Ms. Keene's career, her playing was praised by Artur Rubinstein, who said that her recording of the Rachmaninoff Preludes left him ''completely flabbergasted by the fantastic sweep, color, tone and last but not least, by the incredible technique.'' When Rubinstein decided that his children were old enough to take piano lessons, he hired Ms. Keene as their teacher.         Ms. Keene was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 9, 1921, and began to play the piano when she was 4. She completed high school when she was 15 and never attended college or a conservatory. But in 1934, when she was 13, she became a student of Abram Chasins, the pianist, composer, writer and broadcaster. She and Chasins married in 1949, and performed and recorded together as a duo-piano team. Chasins died in 1987. Ms. Keene later married Milton Kean, who survives her.         In addition to her duet performances with Chasins, Ms. Keene pursued a solo career that was given a boost by her victory at the Naumburg Competition in 1943. She then spent the remaining years of World War II touring Army installations for the U.S.O. At one camp, in Mississippi, she played eight concerts in three days for 65,000 soldiers.         She undertook her first professional tour in 1945, and made headlines in 1946 when she substituted for Vladimir Horowitz at a recital for an audience of 4,000. In the several years that followed, she performed with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and toured with Benny Goodman, as the soloist in Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue.''         Her recordings included works of Bach, Handel, Griffes, MacDowell, Schumann, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Chasins, as well as widely praised recent discs devoted to the complete sontatas of Hummel and Weber.       
         Mary Aiken Littauer, whose love affair with horses began with a childhood pony, blossomed with her marriage to an officer in the cavalry of Czar Nicholas II, and flowered famously when she became a leading expert on horses of ancient times, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Syosset, N.Y. She was 93.         Her son, Andrew, announced the death.         Mrs. Littauer's scholarly career did not begin until her mid-50's, when her husband's health would no longer permit him to maintain his standards of horsemanship. The standards were high indeed: Vladimir S. Littauer was the author of eight books on riding and training horses, and his instructional techniques are still used.         Not wanting to ride alone, Mrs. Littauer was restless. Her husband suggested she write a book about horses.         She had had no college education, but decided to start at the beginning. By bringing her keen intelligence and considerable horse sense to archaeological discoveries, she would write about when and how horses and men got together. Her first article, ''The Function of the Yoke Saddle in Ancient Harnessing,'' appeared in the British journal Antiquity in 1968.         The same year, Mrs. Littauer was introduced to Joost Crouwel, who had just earned a degree in classical archaeology from the University of Amsterdam and was beginning his doctoral thesis on Mycenaean chariots. A collaboration of three decades began.         Dr. Crouwel became professor of Aegean archaeology at the University of Amsterdam. Mrs. Littauer gained fame as the Grande Dame of the study of horses.         The two wrote about 65 articles for academic journals, usually with each other though sometimes with other scholars and sometimes individually. A typical title: ''The Earliest Evidence for Metal Bridle Parts.''         They wrote two books, ''Wheeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East'' (1970) and ''Chariots and Related Equipment from the Tomb of Tutankhamen'' (1985). Both became standard reference works.         ''They have set international standards that will last for many years,'' said Peter Raulvig, an archaeologist and linguist who also studied chariots.         In 2002, Mrs. Littauer and Dr. Crouwel published a collection titled ''Selected Writing on Chariots and Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness.''         An example of Mrs. Littauer's analysis was her article in 1983 in La Recherche, a French counterpart of Scientific American, in which she rejected earlier assertions that the first wheels were used on two-wheeled carts. Instead, she argued, the first real wheel was on a crude four-wheel vehicle. She theorized that soft sands in the Middle East would have made a two-wheeled precursor of the chariot impractical, and pointed to the four-wheeled carriages discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in the so-called King's Tomb in Ur, a Sumerian city that flourished in Lower Mesopotamia (now Iraq) about 4,500 years ago.         But she disputed Sir Leonard's contention that the vehicles were the ''tanks'' of antiquity. The reason was that the harness used was highly vulnerable to projectiles, not to mention the vehicle's occupants, The New York Times reported in 1983.         Her ability to interpret evidence found by others became legendary. She once pointed out that an ancient horse's bit displayed in the British Museum was upside down. Embarrassed curators corrected the error.         Mary Aiken Graver was born in Pittsburgh on Feb. 11, 1912, and grew up in Manhattan. Her formal education ended when she graduated from what is now the Spence School. Her interest in horses dates from her ownership of a cow pony in Nevada, where her family vacationed.         As a young woman, she was a volunteer courier in the Frontier Nursing Service, which provided health care in rural Kentucky. For young society women, the chance to ride horses for many miles over roadless, mountainous terrain in a good cause was grand adventure. She was once caught in the middle of a shooting battle between feuding families.         Mr. Littauer founded a riding academy called the Boots and Saddles Club, and also taught private clients at the family's Long Island home before his death in 1989, at 96. In addition to their son, of Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Littauer is survived by two grandsons.         Already fluent in French, Mrs. Littauer taught herself ancient Greek, German and Russian. Scholars sent her their research results, commentaries and papers to edit.         Mary B. Moore, an art historian at Hunter College specializing in ancient Greece, said that Mrs. Littauer advised colleagues on how an ancient bit or bridle was probably used, or on where the driver would have stood on a chariot. Dr. Moore said those suggestions were utterly practical, and seldom theoretical or aesthetic.         She said that Mrs. Littauer seldom went to archaeological digs, because of her age. ''Sitting around a ditch all day wouldn't have been one of those things she would go for.''         She was nonetheless famously observant. In a paper on the Roman use of horses, Judith A. Walker, an archaeologist, mentioned a chariot and harness found in an ancient tomb.         ''No one person has spent more time studying, reconstructing and analyzing this harness and chariot than Mary Littauer,'' she wrote.         Mrs. Littauer embodied skepticism, as when what appeared to be wheels of chariots were found on the Russian steppes. In an article in The New York Times in 1994, she cautioned, ''A spoked wheel is not necessarily a chariot, only a light car on the way to becoming a chariot.''         On rare occasions, Mrs. Littauer ventured beyond the ancient world, with an interest as modern as the horses of medieval knights.
