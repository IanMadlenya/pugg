         Marie Torre, a former television columnist for The New York Herald Tribune who was jailed for refusing to disclose a source in a libel action, died on Friday at Health South Rehabilitation Hospital of Greater Pittsburgh in Monroeville, Pa. She was 72 and lived in Salem, N.J.         She died of lung cancer, said her son-in-law, Ed Lopez of Manhattan.         Miss Torre served 10 days in the Hudson County Jail in New Jersey in 1959, the first reporter to gain national attention for going to jail for refusing to identify a news source.         Miss Torre, who shortened her last name from Torregrossa, was born in Brooklyn. She joined the Herald Tribune staff in 1955. As a radio and television columnist in 1957, she quoted a CBS executive, whom she did not name, as saying that Judy Garland was balking about doing a CBS special ''because she thinks she is terribly fat.''         Miss Garland sued the network for $1.39 million, and Miss Torre, as a witness in a pretrial hearing, was ordered by the court to disclose the name of her source. She refused, arguing that a reporter should not be compelled to reveal sources in court because such an order violated the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.         ''She never revealed his name, even to members of our family,'' Mr. Lopez said yesterday.         Judge Sylvester Ryan of Federal District Court in Manhattan warned her that she could be jailed for contempt of court. When she again refused, he sentenced her to 10 days in jail. The case drew attention and support from news organizations.         Miss Torre, with The Herald Tribune's backing, appealed the sentence, but it was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals in New York. In his opinion, Judge Potter Stewart, who later served on the United States Supreme Court, conceded that ''compulsory disclosure of a journalist's confidential sources of information may entail an abridgment of press freedom.'' But he added that ''the duty of a witness to testify in a court of law has roots as deep as the guarantee of a free press.'' He held that Miss Torre must yield ''to a paramount public interest in the fair administration of justice.''         The Supreme Court refused to review the decision, but Miss Garland did not pursue the case once Miss Torre's jail term ended.         Miss Torre did a radio talk show in Wilmington, Del., until August, when she was hospitalized.         She is survived by a daughter, Roma Torre of Manhattan, a news anchorwoman; a son, Adam Jeffrey Friedman of Los Angeles; a brother, John Torregrossa of Panama City, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Marie M. Lambert, who campaigned for Manhattan Surrogate promising to ''clean up the citadel of patronage'' but who retired from the powerful judgeship 12 years later best known as a patronage queen, died on Tuesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan, where she practiced law.         The cause was kidney failure, said her son, Gregory L. Lambert. Her health had deteriorated after heart surgery last fall, he said.         As one of two elected judges of the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, which Fiorello La Guardia described  as ''the most expensive undertaking establishment in the world,'' Surrogate Lambert heard disputes pertaining to wills and estates, and formalized adoptions. She directed the flow of millions of dollars a year by appointing guardians for those too young or too feeble to handle their accounts, designating lawyers to manage wills that had no assigned executor, and awarding legal fees.         From 1977, when she was elected, to 1990, when she retired at the mandatory age of 70, Surrogate Lambert, feared for her quick temper and ability to keep lawyers working in her court till the early morning hours, drew fire.         Democratic Party leaders would not endorse her in the primary campaign, saying she lacked judicial temperament and knowledge of trust and estates law. A judicial conduct commission investigated allegations that she was the most hands-on of fund-raisers for the primary, in which she sent out 300,000 pieces of literature and saturated the city with Lambert paraphernalia. The United States Attorney's office would periodically announce that it was looking at how she gave lucrative work to a cadre of lawyers.         But while shadows remained attached to her name, Surrogate Lambert, a gregarious, street-smart personal injury lawyer who was also the first woman president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, eluded her accusers. Despite the absence of party backing and the disdain of the city's editorial pages, she ran a raw and raucous campaign -- and won. Although investigators recommended she be censured for her unabashed fund-raising, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct declined to take action. And though two lawyers would be prosecuted for activities connected to her, she never faced any charges.         In 1990, an appellate court scolded her as it overturned legal fees she awarded to two lawyers, saying the fees were excessive and that the Surrogate had failed to disclose her friendship with them.         As Surrogate, she ruled over the dying wishes of the very rich and the very famous, a role she relished. Marilyn Monroe's estate marched before her, as did those of Lotte Lenya, Yul Brynner, Lillian Hellman and Joan Crawford. ''Relax,'' she told the actor Al Pacino, when he appeared on a matter. ''Nobody is going to bite you, not if I can help it.''         She was regarded as a judge who could compel rancorous cases to settle by sheer dint of her will. ''If she wanted that result, she would get that result -- legal niceties didn't bother her,'' George DeSipio, a former chairman of the city bar's trust and estates committee, recalled. ''She could be quite nasty if you crossed her the wrong way.''         But Mr. DeSipio, who remained on friendly terms with Surrogate Lambert, said that above all, she was passionate about her job. ''She was a happy judge,'' he said.         In her capacity as Surrogate, she used her authority to help gay partners clarify their inheritance rights. Since homosexuals were not permitted to marry, Surrogate Lambert permitted one partner to adopt the other as a means of guaranteeing inheritance benefits.         But her most infamous task was settling the war over the half-billion dollar estate of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. For four months in 1986, Surrogate Lambert presided over the trial pitting Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his one-time maid and third wife, to whom he had left his estate, and his six children by two former wives.         According to David Margolick, a former reporter for The New York Times who chronicled the case in his book ''Undue Influence,'' Surrogate Lambert badgered and belittled Mrs. Johnson and her lawyers, provoking her to settle the case before it went to a jury.         In another case that raised eyebrows and grabbed headlines, Surrogate Lambert, an Italian immigrant who aggressively sought the support of Jewish voters by vowing not to direct funds to banks that joined in the Arab boycott of Israel, opened an investigation into the Palestine Liberation Organization. A journalist had left 10 percent of his $300,000 estate to the P.L.O. Surrogate Lambert said she could authorize payment to a terrorist group. After hearings in 1982, she ordered the money to be administered through the International Red Cross, to address Palestinian living conditions.         Giusippina Giovanna Maria Macri was born in a small town in the Calabria region of Italy in 1920. Her family settled in Brooklyn nine months later, where her father found work as a barber and her mother as a seamstress. She is survived by her sister, Gloria Diemer, and her brother, Charles Courtright.         She showed intellectual promise and ambition at an early age: Embedded in the family lore is the tale of how the young Marie, told by her grammar school that she could not be valedictorian although she had the academic credentials, hopped the subway, went to City Hall, and had an audience with an Italian compatriot, Mayor La Guardia, who immediately ordered the wrong rectified.         After graduating from Brooklyn College, she attended New York University Law School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1946 she married Grady Lambert, a salesman at Abercrombie & Fitch, who died in 1975.         She tried Wall Street law firms, but left because she was told to specialize in trust and estates law, which she considered ''women's work.'' Instead, she made her mark in the male-dominated world of personal injury law. Hungry and bright, she would take negligence cases that no one else would touch and turn them into winners. Her courtroom manner was disarming: She would shuffle in, legal papers spilling out of shopping bags. Juries considered her one of them.         From the outset of her legal career, she understood the importance of networking: In her later years, she would boast of her friendship with Roy Cohn, who escorted her to President Ronald Reagan's first inaugural ball.         In 1974, the New York State Trial Lawyers elected her president. ''She started her career and ended it on behalf of widows and orphans,'' said Aaron J. Broder, a personal injury lawyer.         In 1990, she reached 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges, and returned to private practice reluctantly. There is a Lambert legend  widely repeated in legal circles, which her son could not confirm but said could well be true. In an effort to extend her term on the bench, it is said, Surrogate Lambert traveled to Italy to check her village church records, to see if her birth date was perhaps incorrect.         Correction:  March 30, 1997, Sunday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Marie M. Lambert, a Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan, omitted a word and thus misstated her position in a case involving a bequest to the Palestine Liberation Organization. She ordered hearings into the purpose of the organization because she said she could not authorize estate payments to terrorists. (The obituary is reprinted today on page 25.)

         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Florence M. Kelley, the first administrative judge of the modern Family Court in New York City and an advocate for the legal rights of the poor, died last Saturday at her home in Little Compton, R.I. She was 85.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, David S. Worgan, a retired executive assistant district attorney of New York County.         Judge Kelley presided over the notoriously overworked court during an era of great reform. In 1960, she became the first woman to be chief judge of what was then the Domestic Relations Court of New York City.         ''Florence and I went to Yale Law School together,'' said Mayor Robert F. Wagner when he appointed her. ''She's moved further than I -- and done much better.''         In 1962, when the court was reconfigured as the new Family Court of the State of New York, within the City of New York, with jurisdiction over a range of social problems, she became administrative judge.         A slim, gracious woman, Judge Kelley was ladylike in her manner but decisive and stubborn in her role as a visionary administrator. Then as now, the Family Court, regarded as the stepchild of the system, was criticized for its sprawling caseload. Judge Kelley pressed for more judges, psychiatric evaluations for clients and probation services for juveniles.         Her dedication to legal and social services for the poor was a family heritage: her grandmother, for whom she was named, was one of the first women lawyers in the country and the founder of the National Consumers League, an advocates' group for which Judge Kelley worked.         Born in Manhattan, Judge Kelley graduated from Smith College and Yale Law School.         In the 1930's and 40's, women prosecutors were a a rare sight in the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, where Judge Kelley worked under Thomas E. Dewey and Frank S. Hogan. She next turned to the private sector, spending a few years in a Wall Street law firm. But in 1947, she returned to public life as the attorney in charge of the criminal branch of the Legal Aid Society, where she spent 13 years.         She managed to maintain her sense of humor. Illustrating the heavy caseload of lawyers for the indigent, she told how she introduced herself to a new client in the city's detention pen by saying hesitantly, ''You're the man who robbed the delicatessen.''         He demurred. ''No ma'am,'' he said helpfully, ''I'm the one who pushed the woman out of the 13th-story window.''         In 1970, Judge Kelley became a trial judge of the Supreme Court of New York, serving until her retirement in 1980.         But retirement was a relative term for a woman who was also president of the Women's City Club and a member of foundations dedicated to the poor and the mentally ill. She and her husband moved to Little Compton, where she served on the town planning board and helped raise money for the Sakonnet Light House, which was relighted in March.         In addition to her husband of 44 years, her survivors include her brothers, Augustus M. Kelley and Nicholas Kelley Jr.       
         Rosina Lawrence, whose brief but bright film career still flickers on the home screen in the ''Our Gang,''  ''Little Rascals'' and Laurel and Hardy classics, died on June 23 at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Brooklyn and on Mackinac Island, Mich.         Miss Lawrence, who was known off screen as Rosina Marchisio-McCabe, danced, sang and acted in the 1920's and 30's, appearing in vaudeville and films, from comedic shorts to musical extravaganzas like ''The Great Ziegfeld'' of 1936. She also played the heroine in ''Way Out West'' (1937), which was Laurel and Hardy's favorite of their films. In it Miss Lawrence played Mary Roberts, a scullery maid and unsuspecting heiress whom the duo tracked to a bar in Brushwood Gulch.         Miss Lawrence was hired, at age 20, by Fox Studios to make several films with Alice Faye and Edward Everett Horton, among others. These included ''Ten Dollar Raise,'' ''Your Uncle Dudley,'' ''Music Is Magic'' and ''Charlie Chan's Secret.''         But it was after the merger of Fox and 20th Century that she came into her own. She danced the Marilyn Miller part in ''The Great Ziegfeld'' and was cast as the new teacher, Miss Lawrence, in a series of ''Our Gang'' shorts, the best of which, ''Bored of Education,'' won an Oscar.         She starred as the movie-struck Cecilia Moore, sweet young thing from Iowa, in ''Pick a Star.'' It was another feature with Laurel and Hardy, and in it she matched wits with Patsy Kelly and Jack Haley.         Her last professional appearance was in an Italian film in which she played an American in Italy, ''In Campagna e Caduta una Stella'' (1939). Because of the war, it was not released in the United States until 1950, as ''In the Country Fell a Star.''         Rosina Lawrence was born in Westboro, Ontario, and as a child  moved to Hollywood, where her father was a set builder. His presence assured her entree to the studios, but it took an accident to set her career path, when a bruised knee led to dance classes as therapy.         She danced in Los Angeles theaters during school vacations, and took acting and singing lessons as well. After vaudeville, dance clubs and some stage musicals, she landed her first cinematic dancing role in ''Angel of Broadway'' (1927).         She danced in ''Paramount on Parade'' (1930), featuring Maurice Chevalier, and appeared in ''Connecticut Yankee'' (1931) with Will Rogers, ''Disorderly Conduct'' (1932) with Spencer Tracy and the 1935 MGM hit ''Reckless'' with Jean Harlow.         She ended her career in 1939 and married a Brooklyn lawyer, Juvenal P. Marchisio. He became a New York judge and a leader in the postwar relief efforts for Italy. He died in 1973.         She is survived by her husband,  John C. McCabe, the movie biographer; two daughters, Rosina Mo of Bracciano, Italy, and Margaret Romairone of Manhattan; a son, Juvenal L., of Rockleigh, N.J., and five grandchildren.       
         Harriett R. Taylor, a senior judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court whose actions helped to ease conditions for Washington's poor and homeless, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 65.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Judge Taylor, in a special weekend session in 1989, mandated thorough changes for Washington's homeless shelters, including the addition of 50 beds and an overhaul of safety and sanitation.         In 1982, she instructed Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and housing officials to provide heat and hot water for the tenants of four battered public housing projects.         In a child custody case in 1994 involving a couple who were both lawyers, she ruled for the father.  Judge Taylor found that while both parents ''clearly love their children very much'' the father was doing the better job of balancing career and family obligations. Her ruling, which was upheld on appeal, also provided for the payment of child support by the mother.         The decision was criticized by women's organizations and praised by fathers' rights groups.         Harriett Rosen Taylor was born in the Bronx, was reared in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College and Columbia University Law School. She practiced family and labor law in New York and Washington before becoming the District's first administrative law judge in 1976, working in the newly formed Office of Consumer Protection.         President Jimmy Carter named her to a 15-year term on the Superior Court bench in 1979. She began a second 15-year term in 1994. She assumed senior status last year to teach a course, ''Effective Lawyering: The View from the Bench,'' at Stanford University, and resumed her judicial role in Washington last month.         With a strong interest in legal education, she took part in the Trial Advocacy Workshop at Harvard University and played the judge in many high school and college moot court competitions.         Judge Taylor is survived by her husband, William L., a civil rights lawyer; two daughters, Lauren Taylor of Silver Spring, Md., and Debbie Taylor of San Francisco; a son, David Van Taylor of Brooklyn; her mother, Alice Rosen, also of Brooklyn; a sister, Carole Lachman of Staten Island, and a granddaughter.       
         Lucy Somerville Howorth, a lawyer who said her advocacy of women's rights was inspired by the campaign that won women the vote under the 19th Amendment, died on Aug. 23 at her home in Cleveland, Miss. She was 102.         Mrs. Howorth watched from a crowded Statehouse gallery in Nashville on Aug. 18, 1920, when Tennessee ratified nationwide women's suffrage, and as the 36th state to do so put the 19th Amendment into the Constitution.         A native Mississippian, Mrs. Howorth spent much of her life in the political arena, including a turn as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1932. She was known as Judge Lucy, a sobriquet that stuck after she was appointed a United States Commissioner -- or magistrate -- for the Southern Judicial District of Mississippi in 1927.         A few years later, she moved to Washington and held legal positions in Federal agencies where few women had gone before. She retired in 1954 as general counsel of the War Claims Commission and returned home to the practice of law.         She was a national officer in the American Association of University Women, played a pivotal role in ending the organization's practice of racial segregation in the 1940's and headed a task force on the status of women and their employment opportunities after World War II. As an association vice president in the 1950's, she traveled widely and gave speeches around the country.         Born in Greenville, Miss., she came from a long line of lawyers rooted in colonial America. As a child, she said, her mother took her to suffragist meetings and nurtured her daughter's independent spirit and her wish to become a lawyer, an aspiration hardly befitting a fine Southern lady then.         Her mother, Nellie Nugent Somerville, was the first woman to be elected to the Mississippi Legislature, and Lucy also served there for four years in the 1930's.         Lucy Somerville graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1916 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and went on to study at Columbia University, where she attended political rallies and meetings and regularly visited settlement houses.         ''It was in New York City at that time,'' she recalled when Radcliffe College honored her in 1983 for a lifetime of achievements, ''that I learned to be a whole human being.''         Back home, she earned her law degree with highest honors at the University of Mississippi in 1922 and practiced law until her appointment as Judge Lucy five years later. She held positions on the legal staff in the Veterans Administration and was a director of the V.A. Employees Credit Union from 1937 to 1949, when she joined the War Claims Commission as associate general counsel.         After leaving the Government, she joined her husband, Joseph Marion Howorth, in practicing law again in Cleveland, Miss., until about 1980. Mr. Howorth died in 1982 after 54 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Howorth was president of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Washington and often served as a mentor to women in government. President John F. Kennedy named Mrs. Howorth to a task force on Federal employment for his Commission on the Status of Women.       
         Dr. Hadassah Rosensaft, who is credited with having saved hundreds of Jewish inmates while a prisoner at Auschwitz, died on Friday in Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. She was 85 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Her son, Menachem, said Monday that the cause was liver failure  resulting from malaria and hepatitis she had contracted at Auschwitz.         Dr. Rosensaft was named by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. After she completed her second term in 1994, President Clinton appointed her son to the council. He is the founder of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and was its first chairman.         In 1945, Dr. Rosensaft was an important witness for the prosecution at a war crimes trial before a British military court in Luneburg, Germany, of former commandants and staff members of the Nazis' Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where she had spent a total of 20 months. Her tattooed concentration camp number visible on her left forearm, she stood and identified 15 of the 45 defendants, who were charged with mass murder.         Hadassah Bimko Rosensaft studied medicine at the University of Nancy in France, received her doctorate as a dental surgeon there in 1935 and practiced dentistry in her native city of Sosnowiec in southern Poland from then until August 1943, when she was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp along with her parents; her first husband, Josef Preserowicz, and their 5 1/2-year-old son, Benjamin.         All but she soon died in the gas chambers there, but, as her son recalled, ''because of her medical training, she was assigned to work in what was called the Jewish infirmary at Auschwitz, and in that capacity she saved hundreds of Jewish women'' from the gas chambers.         He recalled that since sick inmates were sent to the gas chambers, she would do things like tell camp officials that the ill inmates were actually healthy, or get the sick women dressed and send them out of the infirmary.         In testimony at a United States Senate subcommittee hearing in 1985, she described the death of one inmate under the foot of the notorious war criminal Dr. Josef Mengele. She said that late in 1943, while she was working in the Auschwitz infirmary, a young woman was late for roll-call outside her barracks. Dr. Rosensaft said Dr. Mengele ''ordered her to come forward'' and ''knocked her down with his booted foot,'' then put his foot on her chest. He hummed an ''aria from 'Madame Butterfly' and kept his foot there until the woman was dead'' from suffocation, Dr. Rosensaft testified. ''He showed the SS men a new way of killing.''         In November 1944, she was sent from Auschwitz in Poland to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, to work in the infirmary. She cared for 150 Jewish orphans there, her son recalled, before the camp was liberated in April 1945 by the British. He said that before liberation, she managed to get extra food and additional care for the orphans, and that only one of them, an infant, failed to survive.         Bergen-Belsen had been rife with infectious diseases, he said, and once she was freed, she told British officers about the conditions and became the civilian head of a hospital that took care of many former Bergen-Belsen inmates, almost all of them Jews.         She was using her maiden surname, Bimko, when she testified in 1945 before the British military court in Luneburg. She sometimes wept as she recounted Nazi crimes. She said some of the total of 45 defendants had picked out Jewish prisoners in the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen camps to be put to death or used as prostitutes.         The British prosecutor, Col. T. M. Backhouse, asked her whether she saw anyone in the courtroom who had taken part in the crimes she was recalling. ''Yes,'' she said.         The presiding judge, Maj. Gen. H. P. M. Berney-Ficklin, asked her to go to the center of the courtroom to get a better view of the accused, who were restless under the glare of floodlights. The defendants she recognized included Josef Kramer, former commandant at Bergen-Belsen, who had become known as ''the Beast of Belsen,'' and a Nazi guard at Auschwitz whom she recalled as ''accompanied always by a great dog.''         When she was asked, ''How many times were you beaten at Auschwitz?'' she answered: ''I, myself, only three times. I was beaten with the hand, and the blows were directed against my face. Twice I was beaten by Dr. Mengele and once by a supervisor named Kuch.''         In 1946, she married Josef Rosensaft, who was chairman of the Jewish Committee of Bergen-Belsen, which oversaw the day-to-day administration of the displaced-persons camp for Bergen-Belsen survivors from 1945 to 1950. Concurrently, he was the chairman of the Central Committee of Jews in the British Zone of Germany. He went on to be president of the World Federation of Bergen-Belsen Survivors Associations. He died in 1975.         Dr. Rosensaft also held high posts in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp and the Central Jewish Committee in the British Zone. At her death, she had been the honorary president of the World Federation of Bergen-Belsen Survivors Associations for two decades.         Beginning in the 1970's, she spent a decade cataloguing an extensive collection of documents and other materials she and her husband gathered about the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen camp, which she has donated to a museum in Jerusalem.         Besides her son, Menachem, of Manhattan, Dr. Rosensaft is survived by a granddaughter, Jodi.         At the end of a celebration of Dr. Rosensaft's 80th birthday, she said, speaking of her granddaughter, who was then 14, ''I pray Jodi will never be confronted by the bigotry that led to the Holocaust.''       
         After Shira A. Scheindlin was appointed to the Federal District Court in Manhattan a few years ago, she told an interviewer for a legal newspaper that she expected to be more of a ''settling judge than a brilliant opinion writer.''         But in case after case these days, Judge Scheindlin seems to be making a name for herself through the incisive, often witty opinions she writes as well as the striking decisions they contain.         On Monday, in a major ruling against the Giuliani administration, she found that city officials had violated New York magazine's free speech rights when they pulled satirical advertisements from buses. The ads tweaked the Mayor for taking credit for most of the city's virtues.         Her 30-page decision was full of meticulous constitutional analysis, but it was also tinged with sarcasm and humor. ''Who would have dreamed that the Mayor would object to more publicity?'' Judge Scheindlin wrote, going out of her way to cite Mr. Giuliani's daily presence in the local newspapers and his appearance in drag last month on ''Saturday Night Live.''         Then, on Thursday, she found herself in the middle of another contentious dispute, between the two most powerful prosecutors in New York City: Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and United States Attorney Mary Jo White.         Mr. Morgenthau's senior aides had asked Judge Scheindlin to block Ms. White's prosecutors from completing a plea agreement in a stock trading case that Mr. Morgenthau had initiated. ''This is a dispute between your bosses,'' the judge said, ruling against Mr. Morgenthau's prosecutors. ''They should sit down for coffee some day and talk about it.''         The judge behind these rulings is a 51-year-old with a master's degree in Chinese history from Columbia University and a law degree from Cornell. She acknowledged that she has ''been doing more on the opinion side'' than she thought she would when President Clinton named her to the Federal bench in 1994.         ''The only answer I can say is that there have been wonderful issues that just begged to be addressed,'' said Judge Scheindlin (pronounced SHEND-lin) during an interview in her 10th-floor chambers in the Federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. ''And I like to write. It's fun.''         But her rulings have drawn the ire of the Mayor and others. For two straight days this week, Mr. Giuliani attacked her decision in the New York magazine case, saying she had ''tortured her interpretation to get where she is.''         Last January, after she suppressed evidence in a case and questioned a program in which the police stopped and searched taxicabs, Mr. Giuliani declared that Judge Scheindlin did not care as much for ''the rights of victims and potential victims as accused criminals.''         And recently, the Federal Court of Appeals overturned another decision, in which she found unconstitutional a law allowing the Government to ban the sale of sexually explicit magazines on military bases.         Nonetheless, other legal experts defend her work. Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said of her New York magazine opinion: ''The idea that this is some sort of torturous reach by her is simply inaccurate. What is unusual here is not the judicial ruling that the First Amendment has been violated, but the Mayor's conduct, which led to the violation.''         As for the taxicab search ruling, Matthew E. Fishbein, a senior Federal prosecutor at the time, said that although Judge Scheindlin rejected the Government's position in the case, ''the degree of criticism directed at her was in my view excessive and unfair.''         In the opinion, he said, ''she went out of her way to suggest ways for the department to conform its policy so that it would pass constitutional muster, something that the department ultimately did.''         Judge Scheindlin will not discuss individual cases, but says she can live with the criticism. ''I realize that some of the decisions are not immediately popular,'' she said. But she believes there is a balance. The long-term benefit, she says, ''is that we keep our constitutional rights.''         Judge Scheindlin, the daughter of a Russian immigrant and his American wife, was born in Washington.  She grew up in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan.         She had never even met a ''real live lawyer,'' she said, until she entered law school in 1972. After graduating, she was a clerk for Judge Charles L. Brieant in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who remembers her as someone who ''got to the point.''         ''Her logic and her thinking are just without parallel,'' Judge Brieant said.         She was in private practice, and served as a United States magistrate and a Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, before being named to the Federal bench. Now, as then, she says she believes that lawyers and judges can make a difference in society.         In personal conversations, the judge laces her comments with a puckish humor and a bright laugh. From the bench, though, she does not waste words. She can seem brusque, and will cut off a lawyer who is rambling. Several lawyers say they have been the target of her withering glance and her admonition that they make their case more clearly.         A week ago, as the oral arguments in the New York magazine case came to a close, one of the city's lawyers rose. ''May I just have half a minute?'' he asked, with apparent trepidation in his voice.         ''I doubt that it is really going to take half a minute,'' Judge Scheindlin said. ''If you let me cut you off in 30 seconds, go ahead.''         One half-minute later, she interrupted him: ''That was 30 seconds. Is that the point?'' In six words, she then summarized it, asking, ''Was that the point?''         ''Yes, Your Honor,'' the lawyer replied.         Ronald L. Kuby, the criminal defense lawyer known for his passionate advocacy and, at times, his loquaciousness in the courtroom, said he had been chastised by Judge Scheindlin, but rightly so.         ''In court, she's brilliant,'' he said. ''Incisive. Suffers fools not at all.'' He said she pays attention to what a lawyer says and ''she gets very upset when you repeat it. Because she actually heard it the first time.''         The judge, in an interview, acknowledged that her style can be quite direct.         You like to get to the point, she was told.         ''Yes,'' she replied.         Do you realize that about yourself?         ''Yes.''         It is part of your style?         ''Yes.''         You do it with everybody?         ''Yes.''         ''People could talk endlessly around and around an issue,'' she went on. ''Let's get to the heart of the matter. I try to be very direct.'' She added: ''I often say to lawyers, what do you want? Focus yourself. Then I get a much better answer.''         The demands she makes of lawyers, she imposes on herself. As arguments ended in the New York magazine case, on a Friday afternoon, she said she would rule ''as soon as humanly possible.''         She worked through the weekend in her chambers, a court staff member said, and when she had not finished by Sunday evening, worked throughout the night. The opinion was ready for release on Monday morning.         ''I felt the urgency of the parties' needs -- both sides,'' she said.
