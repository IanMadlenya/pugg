         Lucy Freeman, a reporter and an author whose early coverage of psychiatry and mental health for The New York Times led to wider reporting on the subject, died on Wednesday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 88.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her nephew David L. Schroedel.         Ms. Freeman, one of the few women on the Times's reporting staff when she was hired in 1940, initially wrote light society features, but moved to breaking news with an award-winning story on the explosion of two ships hauling munitions in Galveston Bay, Tex., in 1947.         By the late 1940's, some time after she began undergoing her own psychoanalysis, she persuaded editors to allow coverage of the growth of psychiatry and the preservation of Sigmund Freud's private papers.         ''It was even more unusual because it was in an era in which psychology was not popular,'' said Nan Robertson, the author of ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''It used to be that people poked fun at getting shrunk.''         Over the course of four years, she reported on welfare, the stigma of mental illness and advancements in treatments for schizophrenic patients. She also studied mental health and welfare programs in the city hospital system.         Her nonfiction books, ranging from detailed studies of Freud to those exploring sources of anger and anxiety, helped familiarize a popular audience with what had long been a hush-hush practice.         Ms. Freeman's first book, ''Fight Against Fears,'' recounted her own experience as a psychoanalysis patient who struggled to overcome her shy, whispery voice and social fears. Published in 1951, the book was in print for 47 years.         Ms. Freeman also wrote 77 other books, including mystery novels and memoirs.         The first of four children born to a prominent New York family, Ms. Freeman was a member of the first graduating class at Bennington College in Vermont.         She was hired by The New York Times in 1940 and would later describe the newsroom of the day as ''a sea of male reporters.''         ''I hardly dared savor the glory. All those men,'' she wrote in a memoir, ''The Beloved Prison,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989). ''I also dared the fleeting thought that among all these masculine forms perhaps I would find a husband.''         She eventually married William M. Freeman, an editor who had fixed an error in a story she filed from Texas. The marriage lasted two years.         Fond of low-cut dresses and high-heeled shoes, Ms. Freeman relished the attention she received from her male colleagues on the city desk, Ms. Robertson said. Mary Yost, Ms. Freeman's agent for more than 15 years, said that she digested academic papers like a scholar, but always preferred to write for a larger audience.         She could at times ''appear to be an ing√©nue, an innocent,'' Ms. Yost said, but she also played a mean game of poker, loved throwing large parties at her apartment with a view of Central Park, and mixed as easily with jockeys as she did with actors and intellectuals.         ''She enjoyed a popular audience for her work, and she wanted it in her social life, too,'' Ms. Yost said.         Ms. Freeman is survived by her brother, Edward Greenbaum of Clearwater, Fla; her sister, Sue Polera of Las Vegas; her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Warren Rosenberg of Scarborough, N.Y.; and numerous nieces and nephews.       
         Virginia Mayo, who began her film career as a chorus girl and comic foil and then proved herself an accomplished actress, died yesterday at a nursing home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., the Los Angeles suburb where she had lived for many years. She was 84.         Her friend Mary Walsh told The Associated Press of her death.         Ms. Mayo, who played opposite Bob Hope in ''The Princess and the Pirate'' (1944), cavorted with Danny Kaye in four of his early comedies, was badly abused by James Cagney in ''White Heat'' (1949) and sailed the seas romantically with Gregory Peck in ''Captain Horatio Hornblower'' (1952), was never completely able to overcome type casting that relied more on her good looks than her acting ability. But she won high critical praise for her performance as the unfaithful wife of a returning veteran in ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946), widely regarded as one of the finest movies to come out of the World War II homecoming experience.         Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film for The New York Times, said that Ms. Mayo was ''brassy and brutal'' as the wife of an Air Force bombardier, played by Dana Andrews, who returns home with neither job nor prospects.         In 1949, Ms. Mayo gave another highly regarded performance in ''White Heat,'' in which she played the wife of a psychopathic gangster.         Ms. Mayo, whose real name was Virginia Clara Jones, was born on Nov. 30, 1920, in St. Louis, the daughter of Luke W. and Martha Raustenstrauch Jones. She studied dancing and was briefly in the ballet corps of the St. Louis Municipal Opera. She took the name Mayo from her brother-in-law, Andy Mayo, whose vaudeville act she joined in 1937. The act, known as Pansy the Horse, made it to Broadway in ''Banjo Eyes,'' a 1940 revue starring Eddie Cantor.         In the early 1940's Ms. Mayo was given a screen test by the David O. Selznick studios, but no contract resulted. Samuel Goldwyn saw her in 1942 when she was performing in a revue at Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe in Manhattan and offered her a spot as a Goldwyn Girl.         Goldwyn saw to it that she received acting and speech lessons. Eleanore King, then one of Hollywood's top charm teachers, had her doubts about Ms. Mayo, complaining that her cheeks ''were too fat for screen work.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Mayo made her debut as a lead in 1944, playing opposite Bob Hope in ''The Princess and the Pirate,'' and then was given many roles in comedies and musicals. The films she made with Danny Kaye were ''Wonder Man'' (1945), ''The Kid From Brooklyn'' (1946), ''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' (1947) and ''A Song Is Born'' (1948). She also appeared as a Goldwyn Girl in the 1944 Kaye vehicle ''Up in Arms.''         She made a number of adventure films, among them ''The Flame and the Arrow'' (1950) and ''The Iron Mistress'' (1952).         Her film career began to fade in the 1950's. She appeared in ''She's Working Her Way Through College'' (1952), in which she co-starred with Ronald Reagan, but she never again got a prime dramatic role.         She remained active with touring companies in the 1960's and 70's, appearing in productions of ''No, No, Nanette'' and ''Barefoot in the Park,'' among other shows. She also appeared on television, in shows like ''Murder, She Wrote,'' ''Santa Barbara'' and ''Remington Steele.''         Ms. Mayo married Michael O'Shea, the actor, in 1947. He died in 1973. They had one daughter, Mary Catherine Johnston, who survives her, along with three grandsons.       
         Miriam Rothschild, the heiress who discovered how fleas jump, brought Chaucerian wildflowers back to modern England and was acknowledged as one of the world's most distinguished naturalists, died Thursday at her home, Ashton Wold, in Northamptonshire. She was 96.         Her death was announced by her family.         Her extensive scientific and conservation achievements were matched by the might of her will and her delectably eccentric personality.         ''Imagine Beatrix Potter on amphetamines,'' The Times of London once said of her.         Though she viewed herself as a naturalist, more of a describer than an experimenter, she was taken seriously as a scientist and often worked with distinguished colleagues. Her well-known work on butterflies making themselves toxic by means of their food choices was done with the chemist Tadeus Reichstein, a Nobel Prize winner. Her highly original observations helped confirm 19th-century theories of evolution that had awaited 20th-century chemistry.         Given the title of dame by the queen in 1999 for her scientific achievements, she was more than a scientist, not least because she never had to fill out a grant application.         Was it odd that a scion of the venerable Rothschild clan should become the world's leading expert on fleas? Hardly. Dame Miriam's father was the banker Nathaniel Charles Rothschild, who found more than 500 new species of fleas. His daughter's six-volume catalog of his collection of 30,000 specimens, which she completed in 20 years beginning in 1953, firmly established her as the flea authority other experts consulted.         Her uncle Lionel Walter Rothschild's collections were just as inspirational. He amassed 2.3 million butterflies, 300,000 bird skins, 144 giant tortoises and 300,000 birds' eggs, among other things..         From her earliest youth, Dame Miriam loved animals and plants. Her mind was free to roam, and she received no formal education until she was 17, when she demanded to go to school. She never earned any degree, but received an honorary doctorate from Oxford in 1968.         Ranging from marine biology to chemistry to pharmacology to neurophysiology to horticulture to zoology, she came up with novel, often startling conclusions.         Her research on insects eating substances that are poisonous to their predators was considered groundbreaking. After determining that butterflies' bright colors were warning signals of their toxicity, she found that other species evolved to mimic the danger-sign coloration. She found that odors emitted by toxic butterflies were mimicked by other species, vindicating 19th-century naturalists' speculations.         Her enthusiasm for wildflowers led to her advising Prince Charles on plantings for his estate and Lady Bird Johnson on her program to beautify American roadsides.         Her interests ranged far beyond science. During World War II she tenaciously pressed the British authorities to admit more Jews from Nazi Germany and at one point personally housed 49 Jewish children. She worked in the top-secret British effort at Bletchley Park to crack the Nazis' code.         She fought for cause upon cause, including better treatment for laboratory animals, rights for homosexuals and free milk for schoolchildren.         Her farm at the family estate of Ashton Wold, near Peterborough, was a passion and her main source of income. Her livestock and plants won awards.         She did it all with a zestfully personal sense of style, wearing the loose-fitting clothes she designed for herself 50 years ago as she walked the grounds with her half-dozen pet Shetland sheepdogs.         Miriam Louisa Rothschild was born on Aug. 5, 1908, at Ashton Wold, where she lived her entire life. Her mother, Rozika de Wertheimstein, was a top Hungarian sportswoman, and Dame Miriam herself played tennis, cricket and squash, the last in international competitions.         Her childhood, as described in a 1987 New Yorker profile by Kennedy Fraser, was ''like a fairy tale: the palatial houses stuffed with mysteries and treasures; the grandfather who liked to shower gold half-sovereigns from his carriage; the brilliant dotty uncle with his cassowaries and his white top hat.''         Her first love was nature. By the age of 4 she was collecting ladybugs and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her.         Her world darkened when she was 15 and her father committed suicide. She temporarily lost interest in his passion, the natural world. But a year or two later, her enthusiasm was rekindled when she helped her brother dissect a frog.         ''I had never before seen fresh, internal organs, blood vessels and nerves,'' she wrote in an essay in Scientific American. Calling the experience ''my road to Damascus,'' she wrote, ''Their extreme beauty was a revelation.''         After taking some courses at the University of London, she worked in Naples and England studying a kind of mollusk.         ''During the first day of dissecting the bivalve,'' she wrote in Scientific American, ''I found a specimen infested with larval trematodes,'' which are parasitic flatworms known as flukes. ''It proved to be a hitherto undescribed species and a most extraordinary one from every point of view. My fate was sealed. I was completely hooked.''         She worked 16-hour days studying trematodes until a German bomb destroyed all traces of seven years of her research.         With the war, she passed a test to be an air warden but was first assigned to work as a dairymaid. She was secretly summoned to work on the top-secret Enigma code-breaking project and labored 12 hours a day for several years with Alan Turing.         In 1943 she married George Lane, a handsome Hungarian-born British commando. They had four children and adopted two more before divorcing in 1957. She is survived by one of her sons and three of her daughters.         As she raised her children, her late-night attention turned to fleas. She began writing about them in clear, engaging prose.         In ''Fleas, Flukes & Cuckoos: A Study of Bird Parasites,'' which she wrote with Theresa Clay in 1952 (Philosophical Library), she argued that most people misunderstood fleas.         ''It is difficult for them to realize that fleas breathe through holes in their sides, have a nerve cord below their stomachs and a heart in their backs; or that certain arthropods lay eggs through their heads and regularly practice virgin birth.''         Using high-speed photography, she studied how fleas jump. She theorized that they descended from winged ancestors and employed modified flight structures. In a famous comparison, she said fleas jump as high for fleas as the Empire State Building would be for humans.         Turning to plants as well as animals, she became one of the first practitioners of the new interdisciplinary approach to biological studies called ecology.         She began designing gardens to attract butterflies, writing extensively on the subject.         ''You can really abandon any romantic idea of creating a home for these angelic creatures,'' she wrote in ''The Butterfly Gardener,'' published in 1983. ''The best you can do is provide them with a good pub.'' She owned a pub for humans, in Ashton, decorated with natural history exhibits.         In 1970 she began to collect, propagate and sell wildflower seeds.         ''In the early 1980's, I went to a lecture given by a distinguished zoologist who said we should preserve our medieval hayfields, because it would take a thousand years to grow one from scratch,'' she said. ''After the lecture I told him I had done a good imitation in 10. From that moment, I thought I should spread the gospel.''         Spread it she did, to Mrs. Johnson and Prince Charles. As a result of the movement she led, British agriculture policies that favored replacing natural meadows with rye grass were reversed.         She remained as down to earth as the stone ruin her own house became as she deliberately let an immense tangle of ivy, wisteria, clematis and roses envelop it.       
         Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.         Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov.         In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.         Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''         Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''         Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.         After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.         She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.         In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her.         In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.         Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.         She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women.         Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.       
         Naomi Leff, an interior designer who created elegant spaces for celebrities and retailers like Ralph Lauren, Ferragamo, Gucci, Giorgio Armani and Helena Rubinstein, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was complications of liver disease, her friend Barbara Ashley said.         She was not widely known by the public because she tended to work for wealthy, private customers. Among her residential clients were Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Barry Diller, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer, her firm said.         Ms. Leff first attracted wide attention in 1986, when she transformed the Rhinelander Mansion at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street, built in 1898, into the flagship store for Polo Ralph Lauren.         As a profile of Ms. Leff for The New York Times in 1989 reported, she pieced together the building from the few original plans that remained, uncovering the site of the original staircase, and ''designed a grand mahogany stair that looks as though it has always been there.'' Similarly, she had ornamental plasterwork recast from surviving fragments so that it, too, appeared original. Writing in 1992, Paul Goldberger, The Times's architectural critic, called this ''the most successful conversion of a New York house into a luxury emporium since Cartier took over the former Morton Plant residence on Fifth Avenue.'' He said it achieved ''just the right balance between beautiful objects for sale and beautiful objects placed to enhance the experience of being in a stage set.''         By that time, Ms. Leff had designed interiors for Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman and had worked from 1975 to 1980 as the senior designer for Bloomingdale's. She then designed interiors for yachts and private planes and the famously expensive Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort in Telluride, Colo.         Preferring what she called ''a modernist, minimalist aesthetic'' with occasional flourishes of Art Nouveau or Art Deco, she was able to capture almost any era or mood.         ''Architects tend to scorn interior decorators,'' said Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest, which published many articles about Ms. Leff's work and picked her as one of 30 or so Deans of Design in a recent issue. ''No architect scorned Naomi Leff, and she worked with some of the best.''         Ms. Leff was born on Aug. 4, 1939, in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, to Frank Leff, who worked for the American Jewish Committee, and Johanna Leff, a teacher in the New York City school system. She attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, then received a Bachelor of Science degree from SUNY Cortland and a master's in sociology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Her parents survive her.         After teaching elementary school in the New York City public school system for a few years, Ms. Leff enrolled at Pratt Institute, earning a master's in environment design with a minor in architecture. In 1980 she opened her own design office, Naomi Leff & Associates, concentrating at first on retail and residential design.         She took an all-encompassing approach. At Shearson Lehman Hutton's Saddle Ridge Conference Center in Beaver Creek, Colo., for example, she put together an extensive, museum-quality collection of American West antique furnishings and artifacts that is now considered one of the best of its kind. Ms. Leff also designed the company's planes, a Gulfstream III and a Gulfstream IV.       
         Gwendolyn Knight, a painter and sculptor from the 1930's who emerged from the shadow of her husband, the painter Jacob Lawrence, late in her life, died on Feb. 18 at her home in Seattle. She was 91.         Although Ms. Knight did not begin to exhibit formally until the 1970's and was long known as the wife of Mr. Lawrence, a leading visual chronicler of the African-American experience, she began painting when she was young and was still setting out in new directions in old age.         This was evident in her first retrospective, titled ''Never Late for Heaven: The Art of Gwen Knight,'' at the Tacoma Art Museum in 2003. Having devoted most of her career to oil portraits of friends, figure studies of dancers, and watercolor and gouache landscapes that seemed to be companion pieces to her husband's work, she suddenly began in the 1990's to draw horses and cats from memory -- quick, lyrical sketches rendered as etchings and monoprints.         ''It wasn't necessary for me to have acclaim,'' she told Charles H. Rowell in an interview for Callaloo magazine in 1988. ''I just knew that I wanted to do it, so I did it whenever I could.''         Gwendolyn Clarine Knight was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, on May 26, 1913, the only child of Malcolm and Miriam Knight. Her father died when she was 2. In 1920, she traveled with a foster family to St. Louis, Mo., and then to New York City when she was 13.         After graduating in 1930 from the Wadleigh High School for Girls, an integrated school in Harlem, she spent two years at the Howard University School of Fine Arts, where she was encouraged by her teachers but had to drop out because of the Depression.         Returning to Harlem, she met the sculptor Augusta Savage, who became her mentor and obtained support for her from the Works Progress Administration. While taking classes at the Harlem Community Art Center she met Mr. Lawrence, whom she married in 1941.         She followed him when he taught at Black Mountain College in Ashville, N.C.; Brandeis University in Boston; and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. In 1949, when Mr. Lawrence was hospitalized with depression, she worked for a time for Cond√© Nast publications.         In the early 1960's, the couple lived in Nigeria, whose native arts influenced Ms. Knight. In 1971, they moved to Seattle, where Mr. Lawrence took a teaching position at the University of Washington School of Art and Ms. Knight had her first one-woman exhibition in 1976. Mr. Lawrence died in 2000.       
         Geraldine Stutz, who transformed Henri Bendel from a carriage trade retailer in decline into a chic emporium of designer brands in the 1960's, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 80.         Her death came after a long illness, said her stepdaughter, Emma Turner.         Ms. Stutz is best known for her 29-year career as the president of Henri Bendel, with a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first, installing their collections in elaborately merchandised departments that heralded the introduction of a new generation of fashion stars -- Stephen Burrows, Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, Holly Harp and Ralph Lauren among them.         Many longtime Bendel shoppers recall Ms. Stutz's 1958 overhaul of the main floor at the store, at 10 West 57th Street, into a U-shaped ''Street of Shops'' widely acknowledged as a precursor to modern shop-in-shop merchandising displays. Based on her taste alone, Ms. Stutz divided merchandise into small vitrines of watches, handbags, stockings, and along one side, an inspiring ''Gilded Cage,'' a giant replica of a birdcage that housed the cosmetics department.         ''Geraldine had a vision of the kind of store she wanted to create,'' said Jean Rosenberg, who was the vice president and merchandising director at Bendel's from six months before Ms. Stutz's arrival in 1957 to their joint departure in 1986, after the store was sold to The Limited. ''It was for a particular kind of New York woman, where she could find a uniformity of taste and a certain amount of comfort in a smallish environment, where everything in one store was to her liking.''         Ms. Stutz was born in Chicago on Aug. 5, 1924. She aspired to an acting career and studied drama at Mundelein College before changing her focus to journalism. She moved to New York to be closer to the theater and found work as a fashion editor for movie magazines, and in 1947 was hired as an associate fashion editor for Glamour magazine, where she covered shoes.         Colleagues described Ms. Stutz as an industrious learner who immersed herself in the subject matter. Grace Mirabella, the former editor of Mirabella magazine, recalled an introduction to Ms. Stutz in the early 1950's, when Ms. Mirabella was working at Vogue. ''She loved to talk about the business and what was going on behind the scenes, and she knew everything about shoes,'' Ms. Mirabella said.         Ms. Stutz put her knowledge to practical use when she went to work for several footwear manufacturers, including I. Miller, the company for which Andy Warhol designed advertisements, after it was sold to the conglomerate Genesco. Maxey Jarman, its president, recognized in Ms. Stutz an ability for merchandising and advertising, and named her to run the Henri Bendel store in 1957. ''Jarman had talked to her at great length about her vision for the store,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It was not going to be a store for everybody.''         Bendel's was known at various times as a hat shop and as the source of the Duke of Windsor's wardrobe, but Ms. Stutz's concept was narrowly focused on a young, sophisticated urban woman, and she rarely ordered clothes larger than size 10. In an article in New York magazine in 1987, Ms. Stutz described her taste for what she called ''dog whistle'' fashion: ''clothes with a pitch so high and special that only the thinnest and most sophisticated women would hear their call.'' She was also one of the first retailers to consider merchandising food and furniture alongside fashion, and she made way for the in-store designer boutique in the late 1960's, as she did for Ms. Rykiel.         ''She recognized that fashion was more than just about clothing; it was about lifestyle and how one lives,'' said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who worked under Ms. Stutz from 1967 to 1976. ''She thought to put in perfumed candles and potpourri at the entrances so that when people walked in, they got this wonderful aroma. She was born with impeccable taste, and practically brought over every European designer who ever came to America.''         Ms. Stutz's Street of Shops replaced what was formerly a dimly lit floor with merchandise randomly displayed along a 100-foot corridor. She installed marble floors and boutiques, small shops within the larger store that changed each season, stocked with exclusive merchandise culled from markets around the world -- a flower shop, stationery, a tiny art gallery, tabletop items from Frank MacIntosh, Lee Bailey's home displays, and a boutique called ''Port of Call'' with objects from Vietnam and Thailand.         Ms. Rosenberg recalled her instructions to travel to Paris to explore the new market for ready-to-wear in 1959, when Ms. Stutz told her, ''Buy anything you want.''         ''It was a store that was edited like a magazine,'' Ms. Mirabella said. ''It was everybody's meeting place on Saturdays or at Christmastime.''         Ms. Stutz took the in-store-shop concept further in the late 1960's with boutiques dedicated to the collections of designers she felt could succeed with the store's support. Stephen Burrows opened his boutique there in 1969, an experience he recalled as a defining moment of his career (one he replicated in 2002 at Bendel's current site: 712 Fifth Avenue).         In 1980, Ms. Stutz assembled a team of investors and acquired the store from Genesco. Five years later she sold her interest, and worked as a publisher with Random House, overseeing books on Andy Warhol and Elsie de Wolfe. She also continued to consult with designers and retailers through a practice called GSG Group, which she founded in 1993.         Ms. Stutz's mid-1960's marriage to David Gibbs, an art dealer and painter, ended in divorce, her stepdaughter, Ms. Turner, said.         Robert Rufino, the vice president of creative services at Tiffany & Co., is one of the many retail executives who found their start with Ms. Stutz. He designed windows for the company in the 1970's, and recalled Ms. Stutz's ability to intermingle her interests in art and film with fashion.         ''In those days, there was nothing else like Henri Bendel,'' Mr. Rufino said. ''It was like working for the best house in the world. To take this little town house and make it look like someone lived there, as you were going from room to room -- it was just one woman's vision on the world of fashion, and yet it did incredibly well.''       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Mary T. Washington, a bookkeeper who in the 1920's began methodically surmounting racial barriers in business to become the first African-American woman to be a certified public accountant and the head of one of the largest black-owned accounting firms in the nation, died on July 2 at a nursing home in Chicago. She was 99.         Her death was reported by her daughter, Barbara Shepherd.         Ms. Washington began her career after high school in the 1920's at Binga State Bank, one of the nation's largest black-owned banks.         She worked at the bank as an assistant to the cashier and vice president, Arthur Wilson.         When virtually no white C.P.A.'s would hire blacks, Mr. Wilson provided Ms. Washington with the requisite experience, according to an account written by Theresa A. Hammond, who is the chairman of the accounting department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.         In 2002, Dr. Hammond published a book on the history of black C.P.A.'s, ''A White-Collar Profession: African-American Certified Public Accountants Since 1921,'' which included Ms. Washington's career and influence.         Inspired by Mr. Wilson, Ms. Washington earned her bachelor's degree in business from Northwestern University in 1941. While a student, she opened her own accounting firm in her basement, recruiting black businesses as clients.         Her husband, Donald Melvin Wylie, a mechanic for Yellow Cab, would cook late-night dinners for the group of ambitious young black men who worked for her during the tax season.         Her first business partner, Hiram Pittman, once described it as an ''Underground Railroad'' for aspiring black C.P.A.'s, who came from across the country to work there because they needed the experience to earn the accounting credential.         A study by the National Association of Black Accountants found that in 1943 Ms. Washington became the first black woman to become a C.P.A. and the 13th black C.P.A. in the country, Dr. Hammond said.         With Mr. Pittman and Lester McKeever, she founded Washington, Pittman & McKeever in 1968, still one of the largest black C.P.A. firms. She retired from the firm in 1985 at age 79.         Mary Thelma Morrison was born in Vicksburg, Miss., on April 21, 1906, to Daisy and William Morrison, a carpenter, who boasted to friends that his young daughter could read the entire newspaper.         When she was 6, her mother died, and she went to Chicago to live with her maternal grandparents. She attended Wendell Phillips High School, where she excelled in math.         Her first marriage, to Seymour Washington, ended in divorce.         Besides Ms. Shepherd, Ms. Washington is survived by two sons, Donald Wylie Jr. of Chicago and Donald Wylie II of Los Angeles; two other daughters, Melanie Blanks of Chicago and Ardelia Smith of Chicago; and nine grandchildren.       
         Hildegarde, whose career as an international cabaret chanteuse spanned almost seven decades and who was credited with starting the single-name vogue among entertainers, died on Friday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. She was 99.         Her death was confirmed yesterday by her longtime friend and manager, Don Dellair.         A regal figure in couturier gowns, jeweled glasses, glittering earrings and, in her later years, a curly platinum wig, Hildegarde influenced a number of other performers. She accompanied herself on the piano, always in her trademark long white gloves, and, fluttering a lace handkerchief, chatted between numbers, often poking fun at herself.         ''Hildegarde was perhaps the most famous supper-club entertainer who ever lived,'' Liberace once said. ''I used to absorb all the things she was doing, all the showmanship she created. It was marvelous to watch her, wearing elegant gowns, surrounded with roses and playing with white gloves on. They used to literally roll out the red carpet for her.''         Although Liberace said he was careful not to imitate her, he did take a single stage name and used ''I'll Be Seeing You,'' one of her best-known numbers, as his own theme song.         Usually billed as the Incomparable Hildegarde, an orchid bestowed on her by Walter Winchell, she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1930's and 40's, when she was booked in plush hotel cabaret rooms and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a year. At one engagement in 1946, she was paid $17,500 a week and 50 percent of the gross over $80,000. She was on the cover of Life magazine in 1939, had a top 10 radio show and traveled with her own orchestra and several dozen pieces of luggage.         Her recordings of such songs as ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' ''The Last Time I Saw Paris'' and ''Lili Marlene'' became worldwide hits. Revlon introduced a Hildegarde shade of lipstick and nail polish, a nursery named a rose for her, and a linen company, picking up on the way she signed her autograph, introduced a ''Bless You'' handkerchief.         Hildegarde's admirers ranged from enlisted men and officers during World War II to King Gustaf of Sweden and the Duke of Windsor. In 1961 she was the guest of honor at a gala at which Eleanor Roosevelt presented her with an award naming her First Lady of the Supper Clubs.         From the 1950's through the 70's, in addition to her cabaret appearances and record albums, she appeared in a number of television specials and toured with the national company of the Stephen Sondheim musical ''Follies.'' Her autobiography, ''Over 50  So What!'' was published by Doubleday in 1961. In 1980, she was in a revival of the 1927 musical ''The Five O'Clock Girl'' at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., and took part in a tour of ''The Big Broadcast of 1944,'' which recreated radio programs of that year. She also did a number of lecture tours at universities and auditoriums, singing, playing, chatting and answering questions.         Born Hildegarde Loretta Sell in Adell, Wis., to German immigrant parents, she began her career in Milwaukee at the age of 16 when, as a music student at Marquette University, she played the piano in a silent movie house. In 1928 she joined a vaudeville troupe, toured for two seasons and then spent a year as an accompanist to various performers. She arrived in New York by way of Camden, N.J., where she struck up a friendship with Anna Sosenko, her landlady's daughter and a budding songwriter, who became the architect of her career.         ''Anna was determined to be a songwriter,'' Hildegarde recalled. ''She made me go with her to New York to sing her work to publishers.'' For a time, Hildegarde took a job as a song plugger for Irving Berlin. She emerged as the one-name Hildegarde after an audition with Gus Edwards, the impresario, who suggested she lose her surname. Ms. Sosenko became her business manager and the two traveled, lived and collected art together for 23 years.         Ms. Sosenko wrote ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' which became Hildegarde's signature song, and was the singer's partner until 1955, when the relationship dissolved. The friendship resumed two decades later.         Although most of her career was in the United States, Hildegarde was engaged to appear at the Caf√© de Paris in London when she was in her early 20's. She was not a great success, but the experience led her and Ms. Sosenko to take off for Paris to learn the art of cabaret.         They remained there for three years. Ms. Sosenko helped her perfect her technique, and she acquired an international flavor by learning to sing in French, Russian, Italian and Swedish. She also developed the precise diction that made every word clear and reduced her slight German accent.         Her name became synonymous with the best clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1934, she sang at the Ritz Hotel in London during the Duke of Kent's wedding festivities. The next year she was back for King George V's jubilee, and she returned in 1937 for King George VI's coronation. She also appeared in several British movies and stage revues.         During the zenith of her career in the 40's, Hildegarde's name appeared on best-dressed lists, and people were stunned when she said she spent $10,000 a year on clothes. By the 60's, the sum had risen to $30,000.         ''I rarely look back, '' she said as she approached 90. ''That's part of the secret of staying young.''         She leaves no immediate survivors, her manager, Mr. Dellair, said.         During a 1993 performance at Manhattan's Algonquin Hotel, Hildegarde said: ''Wrinkle, wrinkle, leave me alone. Go and sliver Sharon Stone.''         ''I can't imagine myself not performing,'' she said in 1995. ''I like to be in harness. I'm good, I know I'm good, and I'm ready.''         Another cabaret legend, Bobby Short, who died this year at 80, once said, ''Hers was the slickest nightclub act of all time.''

         Mary Lee Settle, a master of historical fiction who recreated time and place with visceral, almost fanatical accuracy, died Tuesday at a hospice in Charlottesville, Va. She was 87 and made her home in Charlottesville.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Christopher Weathersbee.         Ms. Settle, who was a National Book Award winner and the author of the novels known as ''The Beulah Quintet,'' explained her research process in an introduction to ''O Beulah Land,'' the first in an interconnected five-book saga that spanned three centuries, from Cromwell's England to what Ms. Settle called ''the feudal coal culture'' of West Virginia, her native state.         To inform her book, she wrote, it was necessary to ''let the past become a present, let it fall beyond intelligence into reliving, which is true sensuous recall, where dreams come from with all their fears and future hopes of things long past.''         ''The Beulah Quintet'' novels, written between 1956 and 1982, were linked by an exploration of the ways American concepts of personal freedom evolved, and began with the journey of former English prisoners to West Virginia's Kanawha Valley (called Beulah in the novels). For instance, the plot of ''The Scapegoat'' (1980), the fourth volume, unfolds during a violent 1912 confrontation between miners and owners. The other books are ''Know Nothing'' (1960), ''Prisons'' (written in 1973, years after ''O Beulah Land,'' but labeled Book I because the action takes place earlier in history) and ''The Killing Ground'' (1982).         But Ms. Settle's work ranged far beyond her birthplace, geographically and otherwise. In 1978, she received the National Book Award for ''Blood Tie,'' the story of American and British expatriates in Turkey. She had been living there, well aware of the sociocultural influences that traveled both ways between natives and outsiders. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard wrote that the American and British characters were ''like so many Typhoid Marys, carrying the disease of change, change as a fever, wherever they go.''         If Ms. Settle's work was never wildly fashionable -- possibly because ''I don't write about being vaguely unhappy in Connecticut,'' she once said -- that allowed it to age well.         In her historical novels, readers could be assured that the characters spoke pretty much the way people in their time and place spoke, or as close to it as was humanly possible to determine. Ms. Settle had been known to spend months on end reading letters and other accounts from the period she was researching without taking a single note. ''She believed that the key to understanding these people was in their words,'' said Starling Lawrence, her editor at W.W. Norton. So she simply immersed herself in them.         ''Ye're no more nor 19, if that,'' a character in ''O Beulah Land'' tells a new acquaintance. In ''I, Roger Williams: Fragment of an Autobiography'' (2001), Williams has low opinions of ''brabble'' and ''fribbling matters.''         Ms. Settle, always sympathetic to other writers and an advocate of their causes, decided that authors should have their own awards program, with the winners chosen by fellow authors. That way the selections would be independent of publishing industry influences. The idea turned into the PEN/Faulkner award, which began in 1980 and which, with a $15,000 grand prize, has become the largest of the country's major fiction awards.         Mary Lee Settle was born on July 29, 1918, in Charleston, W.Va., the daughter of Joseph Edward and Rachel Tompkins Settle. Her father was a civil engineer in charge of worker safety at coal mines. That industry ran into financial difficulties even before the Depression. More than a half century later, Ms. Settle recalled ''the brave Christmas dinner of 1930'' when she and her parents were living with her grandmother ''because the bottom had dropped out of the coal business.'' Ms. Settle attended Sweet Briar College in Virginia for two years, then began a career as a fashion model. ''I took for granted the kind of looks that other women envied and that I treated with a slight contempt,'' she wrote at the age of 69, contemplating the advisability of face-lifts. She is also said to have been given a screen test, along with half of Hollywood, for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.''         During World War II she went to England and served in the women's branch of the Royal Air Force, an experience she recounted later in ''All the Brave Promises: Memories of Aircraft Woman Second Class 2146391.''         In New York after the war, she worked as a magazine editor, but briefly. She often told the story of how, while going over a Harper's Bazaar fashion layout that had been inspired by ''Wuthering Heights,'' she noticed in some notes that Emily Bront√´ had died at 30. It was then, she said, that she decided she had better start on the books she was planning to write, walked into the boss's office and resigned.         Nine years later her first book was published. ''The Love Eaters'' (1954) was about a small-town theater company. She went on to write 22 books, the most recent being ''Spanish Recognitions'' (2004), a travel memoir.         Ms. Settle traveled extensively and lived abroad at various periods in her life for various reasons. In the late 1960's she fulfilled a promise that many of her fellow Democrats had made to themselves. In 1987, she explained it to Nancy Carol Joyner of Western Carolina University: ''I said if Nixon was elected president I was going back to Europe. He was, and I did.''         Ms. Settle married three times and divorced twice. Her first two husbands, Rodney Weathersbee (1939-46) and Douglas Newton (1946-56), were British. In 1978, when she was 60, she married William L. Tazewell, an American writer and historian. He died in 1998.         Like many authors, she had an academic career as well. Her longest association was with Bard College, where she was an associate professor from 1965 to 1976. She also taught at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she lived on and off throughout her life.         Ms. Settle never let age slow her writing career. ''Spanish Reflections'' was based on a trip that she took in her early 80's, after finishing ''I, Roger Williams.''         At the time of her death she was working on ''Tom: An Appreciation of Thomas Jefferson,'' an ''imagined biography'' focusing on Jefferson's youth. Her son said it was not yet clear whether the book was in shape for publication.         In addition to her son, now living in Charlottesville, she is survived by a granddaughter, Beatrice Weathersbee, of Portsmouth, N.H.; a grandson, Nicolas Weathersbee, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and four great-grandchildren.         Just days before her death, Ms. Settle discussed her memorial service with Mr. Lawrence, her editor. In a conversation that inspired her to give an impromptu recitation of a Keats sonnet (''When I have fears that I may cease to be''), she told him that she would like to have the beginning of the Gospel of St. John read. ''If you're a writer, you can see the appeal of that text,'' Mr. Lawrence said.         The first words of the first verse of the Book of John are ''In the beginning was the word.''       
         Vivian Malone Jones, who on a blisteringly hot June day in 1963 became one of two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama after first being barred at the door by the defiant governor, George C. Wallace, died yesterday in Atlanta. She was 63.         The cause was a stroke, her sister Sharon Malone told The Associated Press.         Her entrance to the university came as the civil rights struggle raged across the South. On June 12, the day after Ms. Jones and James Hood were escorted into the university by federalized National Guard troops, the civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot to death in Jackson, Miss.         On May 30, 1965, Ms. Jones became the first black to graduate from the University of Alabama in its 134 years of existence, earning a degree in business management with a B-plus average.         The performance of Governor Wallace, who stood at the doorway of Foster Auditorium flanked by state troopers, fulfilled a campaign pledge stop integration at ''the schoolhouse door.''         But historians have written that his defiance was scripted and came with a promise to federal authorities that he would be brief and would soon comply.         At the time, The Tuscaloosa News wrote contemptuously that the governor ''squeezed every suspenseful moment of drama from the occasion.''         The students waited in a car, as Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, deputy attorney general of the United States, avoided a direct confrontation. He said to Mr. Wallace: ''From the outset, Governor, all of us have known that the final chapter of this history will be the admission of these students.''         Only after the federalized guard troops arrived, four and a half hours after Mr. Wallace's initial refusal, were the students admitted. Mr. Wallace read a second statement challenging the constitutionality of the court order, then briskly left.         The students entered Foster Hall, registered, went to their dormitories, ate in the cafeteria and experienced no further incidents that day.         The first African-American at the university, founded in 1831, was Autherine Lucy, who arrived in February 1956 to pursue a master's degree in library science. But after experiencing three days of threats Ms. Lucy was suspended, ostensibly for her own safety, and later expelled.         More than 35 years later, she earned a master's degree in elementary education at Alabama.         Mr. Hood left the university after two months, saying he wanted to avoid ''a complete mental and physical breakdown.'' He transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit and graduated with a bachelor's degree, having studied political science and police administration.         Mr. Hood. returned to the University of Alabama and earned a doctorate in higher education in 1997.         Vivian Juanita Malone grew up in Mobile, Ala., where she was a member of the National Honor Society in high school.         She earned a bachelor's degree at Alabama A&M, a predominantly black university, but it lost its accreditation. To get an accredited degree, she applied to the University of Alabama's School of Commerce and Business Administration and was admitted as a junior.         One night at midnight, someone knocked on her dormitory door and told her there was a bomb threat. No bomb materialized, but that November, there were three bomb blasts at the university, one of them four blocks from her dormitory.         After Mr. Evers was killed, Ms. Jones said she felt even more determined not to give up.         ''I decided not to show any fear and went to classes that day,'' she said in an interview with The Post Standard of Syracuse in 2004.         In the same interview, she said one of her strongest memories of Alabama was that she often smiled at white students, but got no response.         The university hired a driver for her, a student at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa named Mack Jones. They later married, and he became an obstetrician. He died last year.         Ms. Jones is survived by her son, Michael A. Jones; her daughter, Monica Jones Shareef; three brothers; four sisters; and two grandchildren.         After graduating from Alabama, Ms. Jones worked for the United States Justice Department in its civil rights division. She also worked at the Environmental Protection Agency as director of civil rights and urban affairs and director of environmental justice before retiring in 1996 to sell life insurance.         In 1996, former Governor Wallace presented the Lurleen B. Wallace Award for Courage, named for his late wife, to Ms. Jones. He told her that he made a mistake 33 years earlier and that he admired her. They discussed forgiveness.         In a speech to University of Alabama graduates in 2000, Ms. Jones suggested one lesson that might be taken from her historic experience: ''You must always be ready to seize the moment.''       
         Dorothy Wegman Raphaelson, who 80 years ago in chiffon, silk, feathers and lace floated across Jazz Age stages as a Ziegfeld Girl and went on to outlive all but one of her fellow dancers, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.         The cause was complications of a long-term heart ailment, her son, Joel Raphaelson, said.         The impresario Florenz Ziegfeld was inspired by the Paris revues he saw on a European trip in 1905 and opened his first Follies, a variety show with Rockette-like dancers, in 1907. The revues became a Broadway mainstay and ran in annual installments until Ziegfeld's death in 1932.         Amid the dancers and showgirls, he offered up entertainers like W. C. Fields, Fred Astaire and Bob Hope to audiences that included Diamond Jim Brady, who habitually put up $750 for 10 opening-night seats. Ziegfeld's mission of ''glorifying the American girl'' was heartily seconded by theatergoers, some of whom sent precious jewels ensconced in bouquets of roses to their favorites.         Mrs. Raphaelson not only played the part in the Ziegfeld Follies of the 20's but wrote about her experience in one of her two novels, ''Glorified,'' published in 1930. Ziegfeld himself contributed this to the book jacket: ''I wish every young girl who has aspirations to go on stage could read this honest and delightful story by one of the most charming of my own Follies Girls.''         Her audition: ''It was a lovely tune. One, two, three, one, two, three. I loved to dance! My legs seemed to loosen, my heart ceased its pounding.''         Her na√Øve reaction to being told a dancer was the mistress of a famous man: ''Were there any more in the show? Maybe? I gained a new interest in each girl, and scrutinized each one closely, looking for the unmistakable signs -- a mink coat and diamonds.''         The thrill of performing: ''It seemed I had been out there before the footlights but a second, a wonderful second, during which nothing existed but the dance and the music -- the thrilling music.''         Dorothy Deborah Wegman was born in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 1904, to immigrants from Eastern Europe, and grew up in Washington Heights. Her father was a civil engineer; according to an article in The New York World-Telegram in 1934, it was her mother who steered her daughter, at first reluctant, onto the stage.         Dorothy's father died when she was 14, and she left high school to support her mother and younger brother by sketching clothes for a coat and suit manufacturer.         She made her debut as a dancer in a Shubert revue, ''The Passing Show of 1921,'' at the Winter Garden Theater.         Ziegfeld divided dancers into ''shorts, mediums and talls,'' and Mrs. Raphaelson, then known as Dolly, was cast in the Follies of 1924 as a medium. She switched to her proper name, Dorothy, for that show. In 1927, while appearing in the Ziegfeld musical ''Rio Rita,'' she was given the diminutive Dorshka by Marion Benda, a well-known Ziegfeld beauty, and the name stuck.         During the run of ''Rio Rita,'' which The New York Times review said had ''inordinately beautiful dancing girls,'' she eloped with Samson Raphaelson, who wrote both the play and film versions of ''The Jazz Singer,'' as well as the short story on which they were based, among many other things.         After seven years with Ziegfeld, Mrs. Raphaelson took to domestic life ''like a bird to air,'' according to The World-Telegram. In later years, she acted in summer stock and published her second novel, ''Morning Song'' (1948). The couple lived successively in Hollywood; Bucks County, Pa.; and New York. Mr. Raphaelson died in 1983.         Doris Eaton Travis, 101, is now the sole surviving Ziegfeld Girl, according to Nils Hanson, administrator of the National Ziegfeld Club. In a telephone interview from her home in Norman, Okla., Mrs. Travis said that ''in a sense'' she felt suddenly lonely.         Mrs. Travis said she perfectly recalled her own audition for the Ziegfeld Follies in August 1918, becoming one of 3,000 chosen from the 15,000 women who tried out. She went from a ''special girl'' in 1919 to a full-fledged principal the next year to a solo performer in 1920.         ''It was beauty, elegance, loveliness,'' she said, ''beauty and elegance like a French painting of a woman's body.''         Mrs. Raphaelson is survived by her son, Joel, who lives in Chicago; her daughter, Naomi Yocum of Lancaster, Pa.; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.         Her long-term memories never dulled. One was of Al Jolson being protective of her when an off-color joke was told. ''Get your coat, Dorothy, you're going home,'' he ordered.         Another lay behind the inscription of her copy of Will Durant's ''Story of Philosophy.'' She had told a long-ago admirer to buy her the book rather than the diamond bracelet or fur wrap he offered.         ''For Dorothy,'' the inscription read. ''This was your idea, not mine.''         Correction:  November 18, 2005, Friday  An obituary on Saturday about Dorothy Wegman Raphaelson, a Ziegfeld girl, misidentified the author of the screenplay for the 1927 movie ''The Jazz Singer.'' The author was Alfred A. Cohn, who adapted it from a stage play by Samson Raphaelson (Mrs. Raphaelson's husband), not Mr. Raphaelson.       
         Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan was a Queens homemaker in 1964 when The New York Times revealed her notorious past as a vicious Nazi death camp guard.         Nearly a decade later, she became the first United States citizen to be extradited for war crimes. She was sent to West Germany, where she was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison.         That was in 1981, and little has been written about her since, although a German newspaper took note of her release, for health reasons, in 1996.         It turns out that she died three years later, on April 19, 1999, at the age of 79.         Her death appears to have gone unrecorded by American newspapers and magazines, although it is noted on the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia and in a footnote in a 2005 memoir, ''Omaha Blues,'' by Joseph Lelyveld, a former executive editor of The Times, who recounts his experience as the young reporter who knocked on the door of the Ryan home more than 40 years ago.         Official word of Mrs. Ryan's death came in recent weeks from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Israel, in response to questions by another Times reporter who was researching an article on the former Maidanek death camp in Poland, where Mrs. Ryan was once assigned.         Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israeli center, said he believed the death had been noted in some German papers. He said he did not know the cause, but in 1996, when the German government pardoned her from her life sentence, she suffered from diabetes and had had a leg amputated.         Dr. Zuroff said Mrs. Ryan's extradition and conviction were among the few successful legal actions against Nazis in the United States before the Justice Department Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979.         At the time she was discovered, Mrs. Ryan was living as the wife of an electrical construction worker in Maspeth, where she was known for her scrupulous housecleaning and friendly manner. When she was fighting deportation in 1972, The Times quoted neighbors saying her gruesome past was impossible for them to believe.         Survivors of the Maidanek concentration and death camp, near Lublin, told of her whipping women to death, seizing children by the hair and throwing them on trucks to take them to the gas chamber, kicking away a stool to hang a young girl, and stomping old women to death with her jackboots, among other cruelties. Her nickname was the Stomping Mare.         In her five-and-a-half-year trial by a West German court, which ended in mid-1981, Mrs. Ryan was convicted of just two murders. The deaths of possible witnesses and fading memories may have weakened the prosecution's case on other counts. Also, rules limited convictions to individual crimes actually witnessed.         Hermine Braunsteiner was born in Vienna on July 16, 1919. Her father was a butcher and not involved in politics. She received a strict Roman Catholic education and first wanted to be a nurse.         She instead worked in a brewery and as a household servant before going to work at the Heinkel Aircraft Works in Berlin, where she adopted the Nazi ideology. She applied to work at the Ravensbr√ºck women's concentration camp in part to get more pay, starting in 1939.         In October 1942, she was transferred to Maidanek and promoted to assistant warden. She became known for whipping women for not sewing on their prison numbers correctly.         In 1944 she was sent back to Ravensbr√ºck to lead a work detail. She had risen to supervising warden when the Soviet Army approached the camp. She fled to Vienna before the Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on July 23, 1944.         In 1946, she was arrested in Austria and handed over to Allied authorities, who shuffled her between internment and prisoner-of-war camps. In 1949 Austrian authorities again arrested her, and this time tried her.         She was convicted of assassination, infanticide and manslaughter at Ravensbr√ºck in 1941 and 1942. Maidanek was barely mentioned.         Mrs. Ryan was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released early, in 1950. The Austrian government promised not to charge her with any additional crimes and granted her amnesty.         She then worked at hotels and restaurants, and met Russell Ryan, described in various sources as an American soldier or an American construction worker in Germany. In 1958, they moved to Nova Scotia, marrying in October of that year.         In April 1959, they moved to Queens, and she became an American citizen in January 1963.         Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, who died in September, wrote in ''Justice Not Vengeance'' (1989) that he was approached in January 1964 in the Cafe Royal in Tel Aviv by three survivors of Maidanek. They told him about the cruel guard called Kobyla, the Polish word for mare.         One of his aides went to Vienna and discovered from her friends that she was in Halifax. Mr. Wiesenthal learned from a friend in Toronto that she had moved to Queens and got the address. The Nazi hunter then told the Vienna correspondent of The Times this information.         Mr. Lelyveld, as a young reporter, was assigned to check out the tip, but wrote that he was not given a specific address. He knocked on many doors of Queens residents with the last name Ryan.         On July 14, 1964, Mr. Lelyveld wrote that Mrs. Ryan readily acknowledged that she was Hermine Braunsteiner of Maidanek. She protested that she had already been punished in Austria, and said she was sick in the infirmary for much of the time she was assigned to Maidanek. Her husband told the reporter that he did not know she was a prison guard until Mr. Lelyveld informed him.         ''This is the end of everything for me,'' Mrs. Ryan said.         In 1971, she was stripped of her citizenship because she had concealed her criminal conviction from American immigration authorities. Germany and Poland then applied for her extradition.         She feared going to Poland, but said she was agreeable to going to West Germany. In August 1973, Mrs. Ryan was expelled from the United States. Her trial in D√ºsseldorf began in November 1975. With the many witnesses and procedural delays, it did not end until mid-1981.         Mr. Lelyveld wrote that in prison, Mrs. Ryan refused to speak to other inmates and liked to sew dolls and soft toys. When she was released, she went to a nursing home in Bochum-Linden where her husband lived.         A German weekly, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, wrote of the couple in 1996, saying he had been seen pushing her through the market in a wheelchair, and asking her if she would like a bouquet of flowers. She did not respond. He looked at his watch and pushed on. Nothing is known of him now.         Correction:  December 10, 2005, Saturday  An article on the obituary page on Dec. 2 about Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, a Queens homemaker who had once been a Nazi death camp guard, referred incompletely to the coverage of her death, in 1999. Although her death appears to have gone unrecorded at the time in the United States, it was noted in passing by some newspapers -- including The Daily News and Newsday -- in their obituary coverage, in September, of Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who tracked her down.
