         Han Schroeder, an architect, interior designer and educator, died on March 20 in the Boerhaave Clinic in Amsterdam. She was 73 years old and lived in Richmond.         She died after a short illness, said Janet De Cecilia, the coordinator of the interior design program at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I., where Ms. Schroeder had taught.         Ms. Schroeder was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Her family lived in Schroeder House, a landmark De Stilj house designed in 1924 by the architect Gerrit Rietveld, with whom Ms. Schroeder later worked, in collaboration with her mother, Truss Schroeder-Schraeder, an interior designer. From 1972 to 1987, Ms. Schroeder was the consulting architect for the restoration of the house, now a museum. Two of her drawings for the restoration are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Before immigrating to the United States in the early 1960's, she had her own architecture and interior design office in Amsterdam. In 1964 she settled on Long Island to teach interior design at Adelphi University and the Parsons School of Design, and three years later she was appointed professor at the New York Institute of Technology. In 1981 she moved to Richmond, where she taught at Virginia Commonwealth University until retiring as professor emerita in 1988. She was one of the first women to have their work represented in the archives of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va.         She is survived by a brother, Binnert, of the Hague.       
         Moira Dryer, an abstract artist known for working in glowing colors on sheets of plywood, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 34 years old.         She died of cancer, said James McKinley, a friend.         Ms. Dryer's distinctive painting method involved applying diaphanous washes of either casein or acrylic paint to big squares of wood, creating veiled, undulating patterns that could suggest an open landscape, the sea or a soft freehand tapestry. This process was inspired by the thin paint surfaces of the Italian Renaissance frescoes she saw on a trip to Florence in 1978. But her paintings rested firmly within the tradition of American postwar abstraction and related in particular to the work of Milton Avery, Morris Louis and the young Frank Stella.         Ms. Dryer was born in Toronto, a daughter of Pegeen Synge, an architect, and Douglas Dryer, a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto. She attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal and then transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. There she studied with the painter Elizabeth Murray and graduated with honors in 1981. In January 1982 she married Victor Alzamora, a fellow student at the School of Visual Arts, who died in June 1983.         Since the early 1980's, Ms. Dryer's work has been included in numerous group exhibitions in museums and galleries around the country. Her first solo exhibition was held in 1986 at the John Good Gallery in Manhattan, and there were subsequent solo shows at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the Fred Hoffman Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Mario Diacono Gallery in Boston.         She is survived by her father, Ellis Dryer of Toronto; a brother, Matthew, of Buffalo; a sister, Dr. Dagny Dryer Murray, of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and a grandfather, John L. Synge of Dublin.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Maud Sargent, a retired landscape architect and planner in New York City and Philadelphia, died on Wednesday at her home in Chester, Conn. She was 93 years old.         She died of complications of bone cancer, a spokeswoman for her estate said.         While working for the Manhattan Department of Borough Works, Miss Sargent was responsibility for designing Carl Schurz Park along the East River. The park surrounds Gracie Mansion, the Mayor's official residence. In 1937 she represented the United States at an international meeting of architects, landscape architects and city planners in Switzerland.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Margaret Hockaday LaFarge, a pioneer among women in the advertising industry whose saucy, irreverent ads shook up Madison Avenue, died on Friday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 85.         She died in her sleep of heart failure, said her niece, Susan Hockaday Jones.         Miss Hockaday, who used her maiden name professionally, was founder and president of Hockaday Associates, a New York agency with a reputation for whimsy and flair. The Hockaday ads were so inventive that they were frequently reported on in the general press and the trade magazines.         She made her first big splash in 1953 with Dunbar furniture, picturing sofas, armchairs and beds in treehouses, on city streets, in green fields -- everywhere but in their normal setting.         Then followed the Capezio campaign, starting in 1956, in which the shoe company was presented as a state of mind, with shoes not even mentioned in the ads for several years. Her "Capezio people" appeared everywhere; some critics complained that the ads did not picture the product, but they sold shoes.         Her most quoted slogans were for swimwear and Scotch: "Just wear a smile and a Jantzen," and, "As long as you're up, get me a Grant's."         Under her direction Hockaday Associates, which had started out in 1949 in a converted barber shop on 58th Street, moved to 575 Madison Avenue. Her list of accounts grew to include Fuller Fabrics, Crane stationery, Health-tex clothing for children, Elizabeth Arden, Reed & Barton silver, Royal Worcester Porcelain.         Her husband, L. Bancel LaFarge, an architect, died in 1989. Besides her niece, Susan, of Princeton, N.J., she is survived by two nephews, Peter Hockaday of San Francisco and John Hockaday of Alexandria, Va.       
         Antoinette Deland Carter, a travel writer, died on Friday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 53 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Carter died of cancer, said her husband, Stephen Carter.         Known professionally as Antoinette Deland, she wrote three popular travel guides: Fielding's Worldwide Cruises, which she began writing in 1985 and wrote for five revised editions; Fielding's Far East, which she wrote in 1983, 1987, and 1990, and Fodor's Bermuda, which she wrote from 1979 through 1987.         Mrs. Carter was a native of Rochester.         She studied at Bryn Mawr College and received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.         In addition to her husband, Stephen, an architect and photographer who contributed to her articles, Mrs. Carter is survived by two brothers, Dr. Thomas Killip, of Manhattan, and Colbeth Killip, of Ogonquit, Me., and an aunt, Priscilla Balaban, of Wilmington, N.C.
