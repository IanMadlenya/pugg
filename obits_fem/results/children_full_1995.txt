         Elizabeth Montgomery, the pert actress who enchanted television audiences as the star of the long-running comedy series "Bewitched," died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 57.         Last month, Ms. Montgomery underwent surgery for the removal of what was characterized at the time as a small malignant tumor. Her family would not disclose the type of cancer.         "Bewitched," a top-rated ABC situation comedy set in suburbia, ran from 1964 to 1972. Its green-eyed star played Samantha, a witch and the wife of an advertising executive who tried to suppress her supernatural talents yet often resorted to sorcery to solve problems.         The comedic twist was that her efforts to shun witchcraft were strongly resented by her kin. They included Samantha's mother, Endora, played by Agnes Moorehead, and the trouble-making Serena, a look-alike cousin also played by Ms. Montgomery. The clue to Samantha's impending sorcery was a twitch of her nose. The witch's perplexed husband, Darrin, was played first by Dick York and then by Dick Sargent.         "Bewitched" was Ms. Montgomery's first and only television series. After the series ended, she had a successful career as a star in made-for-television movies. One of them, "Deadline for Murder," was broadcast by CBS last week. In it, the actress portrayed the reporter Edna Buchanan, whom she had played in "The Corpse Had a Familiar Face" in 1994.         Ms. Montgomery was born on April 15, 1938, her publicity agent said. Her father was the actor and director Robert Montgomery. Her mother, Elizabeth Allen Montgomery, was an actress.         A native of Los Angeles, she graduated from the Spence School in New York City and attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. After three years of intensive training, she made her television debut in the 1950's television playhouse series "Robert Montgomery Presents," of which her father was the producer and host.         In the 1950's and 60's, she also appeared in films, including "The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell" (1955), with Gary Cooper, and "Johnny Cool" (1963). She was narrator of "The Panama Deception," a documentary about the American invasion of Panama, which won an Academy Award in 1993.         Her television movies often won critical praise. Among them were "A Case of Rape" (1974), "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" (1975) and "Black Widow Murders: The Blanche Taylor Moore Story" (1993).         She is survived by her husband, the actor Robert Foxworth, and three children from an earlier marriage to William Asher, the producer of "Bewitched." Her first husband was the actor Gig Young.       
         Margaret Chase Smith, a flinty, independent Maine Republican who made history as the first woman to win election to both houses of Congress and the first whose name was advanced for the Presidency at a national convention, died yesterday at at her home in Skowhegan, Me. She was 97 years old.         A spokeswoman from the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan said she had died of complications from a stroke eight days earlier that had left her in a coma.         A red rose was Mrs. Smith's trademark, a stalwart conscience, her beacon. She was known as the "conscience of the Senate."         In four terms in the House, from 1941 to 1949, then four in the Senate through 1975, Mrs. Smith won friends and earned foes across a wide political spectrum. She could number among her enemies such polar opposites as the Communist-hunting Joseph R. McCarthy and the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev. The formidable Mr. McCarthy referred sneeringly to Mrs. Smith as a "Snow White," and Mr. Khrushchev saw her as "the devil in the disguise of a woman."         Mrs. Smith said her life in politics was her only life. "I have no family, no time-consuming hobbies," she said late in her Senate career. "I have only myself and my job as United States Senator."         But she also had a sense of humor.  In 1952, when asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: "I'd go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I'd go home."         Though Mrs. Smith seemed to many people a champion of women's rights, she said she did not regard herself as a feminist. "I was treated fairly in the Senate, not because of equal rights but because of seniority," she said in a 1975 interview.         In her dedication to her work, she answered 2,941 consecutive Senate roll-calls, a series broken only when she underwent a hip operation in 1968. In time, she became the ranking Republican on the Armed Services and Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committees, and served as well on the Appropriations Committee.         Never anything but a Republican, Mrs. Smith was hardly the dyed-in-the-wool variety. Party regulars could never take her vote for granted. She voted as she saw fit.         In the 1950's, Mrs. Smith alienated McCarthy by joining with six other Republican senators in making a "declaration of conscience" in which she took the measure of McCarthy's sensationalist, inquisitorial methods in trying to suppress Communism.  "I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horseman of calumny -- fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear," Mrs. Smith said. McCarthy responded by referring to her and the six other senators as "Snow White and the Six Dwarfs."         Khrushchev was understandably restrained when Mrs. Smith, a consistent advocate of a strong military, criticized President John F. Kennedy because she thought he lacked the will to use nuclear weapons and concluded that such restraint weakened America's struggle against the Soviet Union. When Mr. Khrushchev heard of Mrs. Smith's stance, he said he thought it had beaten "all records of savagery."         But Mrs. Smith replied: "Mr. Khrushchev isn't really mad at me. I am not that important. He is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech."         Shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy called Mrs. Smith a "formidable political figure" against whom he would not like to campaign. The morning after his death, she went into the Senate chamber before it convened and laid a red rose on Kennedy's old desk.         As a member of Congress she supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, much to the dismay of her more conservative colleagues. Over the years, she angered fellow Republicans by supporting Federal aid to education in 1948, by voting against Lewis L. Strauss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's nominee for Secretary of Commerce in 1959, and by opposing President Richard M. Nixon's unsuccessful nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement F. Haynsworth in 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in 1970.         She was a strong supporter of civil rights and, again irritating some Republican colleagues, an early advocate of Government-financed medical care for the elderly.         Margaret Madeline Chase was born on Dec. 14, 1897, in Skowhegan on the Kennebec River in central Maine. Her father, George Emery Chase, was the town barber and her mother was the former Carrie Murray.         As the eldest of six children in a family of modest means, Margaret was expected to work -- and that she did even as a schoolgirl; she was skillful enough to shave her father's customers when he was busy or away from the shop.         After graduating from Skowhegan High School in 1916, she held jobs for which a college education was not always required: telephone operator, circulation manager for a weekly newspaper, grade-school teacher and eventually a woolen mill executive.         In 1930, at the age of 32, she married Clyde H. Smith, who was 22 years her senior and co-owner of the local newspaper. Mr. Smith, who was prominent in local Republican circles, ran for office and in 1937 was elected Representative from Maine's Second Congressional District.         In 1940, seriously ill after suffering a heart attack, Mr. Smith asked Maine voters to continue his policies by electing his wife to succeed him. After his death, she was chosen to fill his unexpired term in a special election and was elected in her own right later that year.         In 1948 Mrs. Smith entered the Republican senatorial primary and received more votes than her three male opponents combined. In the general election she easily defeated her Democratic rival, Dr. Adrian Scolten.         She said she considered taking her maiden name back after her husband's death, adding: "My name was Chase. It's a good New England name. I liked it. But legally I was Smith."         She quickly grew in stature as a senator and was mentioned as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1952 and again in 1968. In 1964 Mrs. Smith announced her candidacy for President and ran in the New Hampshire primary that year. She drew more than a dozen votes at the Republican National Convention, which was controlled by the conservative forces backing Barry Goldwater.         She seemed unstopable until 1972, when William D. Hathaway, a 48-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress, defeated her in her campaign for a fifth Senate term. She was 74 at the time and seemed increasingly frail, riding the Capitol corridors on a small yellow cart and carrying a cane. There were rumors that her health was fragile, but she remained robust for many years.         In her later years she was no less independent but grew weary and wary of militants.         In 1970, 20 years after she had denounced McCarthy's scare tactics, she said that those on the radical left who advocated violence were easily the equal to the menace she had perceived from the radical right two decades earlier. "We had a national sickness then from which we recovered," she said. "We have a national sickness now from which I pray we will recover."         But, true to form, she also attacked those in the Government who, she believed, had overreacted to the anti-war demonstrators.         Mrs. Smith did not remarry after the death of her husband. She is survived by a sister, Evelyn Williams of Skowhegan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Jean Muir, the British fashion classicist whose design career spanned more than 30 years, died on Sunday in London at the London Clinic. She was 66.         She died of breast cancer, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.         Often referred to as the doyenne of British fashion, Miss Muir, as she insisted everyone call her, designed starkly simple clothes that were timeless and elegant. A perfectionist who tried on everything she designed, she was best known for matte jersey dresses, supple suedes, featherlight punched leathers and cashmere sweaters.         She considered herself a dressmaker first and foremost, yet employed tailoring techniques to achieve the controlled flow of fabric that gave her jersey dresses their signature fit. The shoulders were small, the waist slightly raised and the skirt fluid. It was a shape that particularly suited her petite figure. The dresses were nearly always in the somber black and navy blue she preferred and wore almost exclusively.         Miss Muir developed a personal style that changed very little. For most of her life, her reddish brown hair was cut into a straight bob, her face was chalky white and her lipstick the color of black currants. Her London apartment was entirely white, down to the white rubber flooring. She was frequently quoted as saying, "When you find something that suits you and never lets you down, why not stick with it?" It was a statement that applied equally well to herself and to the clothes she designed, which were instantly identifiable as Jean Muirs and never followed the vagaries of fashion.         "Jean was unique and original and irreplaceable," said Geraldine Stutz, the former president and owner of Henri Bendel in New York, which carried Miss Muir's clothing from the early 60's until the late 80's. The clothes can now be found at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Linda Dresner.         "You can say unique and irreplaceable," Ms. Stutz added, "but in Jean's case it is literally and historically true. For years, other designers tried to copy the Jean Muir look and failed. The only ones who didn't try were the French, who called her 'la reine de la robe,' the dress queen."         Yet, Miss Muir never had formal design training. Born in London and of Scottish descent, she attended boarding school in Bedfordshire, where she was taught sewing and knitting. At 11 she started to make clothes for herself and at 19 went to work in the stockroom at Liberty, the London store. She eventually became a sketcher in the store's made-to-measure department, and she went to Jaeger as a designer in 1956.         In 1962, she became the designer for Jane & Jane, a company of young Londoners who, along with designers like Mary Quant, helped to shake up the staid British fashion world. That was when she caught the eye of Jean Rosenberg, the foresighted buyer who brought her to Bendel's.         In 1966, she formed Jean Muir Ltd. in partnership with her husband, Harry Lueckert, a former German actor she had married in 1955. In her own business she was able to develop the style of clothing that appealed to women as diverse as Princess Alexandra, Lady Antonia Fraser, Glenda Jackson, Lauren Bacall and Joanna Lumley, the co-star of the British comedy "Absolutely Fabulous," who once worked as a Jean Muir model.         She won many fashion awards, including election to the British Fashion Awards Hall of Fame last year, and was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1984. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1973. She served on the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1979 to 1983 and became a trustee the next year.         Miss Muir, who had no children, is survived by her husband. She will be buried at Lorbottle, her estate in Northumberland, 15 miles from the Scottish border. A memorial service will be held at a later date.       
         Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.         Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929.         "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."         As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."         She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."         Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.         In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.         In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."         In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."         The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.         Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Julia Adler Foshko, the last surviving member of a generation of Adlers who began their theatrical careers on stage with their parents in the Yiddish theater, died yesterday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 97 and  had been a resident of the Actors Fund Home in Englewood for many years.         Although she was eventually eclipsed by her younger siblings, Stella and Luther, Miss Adler, the middle of the five children of Jacob and Sarah Adler, the founding stars of the American Yiddish theater, had her moments in the spotlight.         Among other Broadway roles in the 1920's, she played Shylock's daughter, Jessica, in the David Warfield production of "The Merchant of Venice," and was cast by David Belasco as the star of "Rosa Machree."         Her last Broadway appearance was in the 1939 revival of the Clifford Odets play "Awake and Sing!" in a part originated by her sister Stella in the initial  production four years earlier. "Julia Adler," wrote Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times, "improves a little upon Stella Adler's playing."         She later toured with her brother Luther in "Tovarich," which appeared at the City Center in 1952.         Like her brothers and sisters -- including two older full siblings, Frances and Jay, and three still older half siblings, Abe, Charles and Celia Adler, born from her father's two previous marriages and an intervening liason in Russia --  Miss Adler began her career early.         The Adler children were generally thrust on stage as toddlers, but Julia, who was born on July 4, 1897, almost broke the record. According to family legend, she arrived moments after her mother had completed a matinee performance in Philadelphia.         There were a lot of Adler mouths to feed, but, fortunately, there were a lot  of parts to go around.         In 1930, the family, including Julia and her mother, Sarah, took 9 of the 10  roles of a George Jessel production, "Millions." The Adlers graciously allowed the director, Joseph Schoenhold, to play the 10 part.         Miss Adler's older siblings, Frances and Jay, died many years ago. Luther, died in 1984 at the age of 81, and Stella, who operated a celebrated Method acting school in New York City, died in 1992 at the age of 91.         Miss Adler, whose husband, Joseph Foshko, the artist, died many years ago, is survived by a daughter, Judy Sure, of Nantucket; three grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
         Anne Ratner, a music patron who kept alive the idea of the music salon, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Ratner put on concerts by first-rate artists in the living room of her Riverside Drive apartment. Among those who appeared, often more than once, were the Emerson and Juilliard Quartets, the singers Arleen Auger and Cecilia Bartoli and the pianists Richard Goode, Jeffrey Kahane and Andras Schiff. Appearance at these evenings became somewhat of a status symbol among musicians, and they often served as showcases for emerging talents.         Ms. Ratner, who organized these evenings by herself, asked each person in the small audiences for at least $30, but personal profit was not on her mind. Ms. Ratner was born in Russia and reared in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She studied the piano and in 1929 married Hyman Ratner. After her husband died in 1960, she taught at the League Center for Seriously Disturbed Children in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The salon concerts -- up to 18 per season -- developed through her work at the center and served as benefit events for the center and for Camphill Village, a community in Copake, N.Y., for mentally handicapped adults.         She is survived by two daughters, Molly Finn of Manhattan and Judy Pitt of Leonia, N.J.; two sisters, Rebecca Jarmon of Forest Hills, Queens, and Mina Gudeon of Sunrise, Fla.; a brother, Saul Kamen of North Hills, L.I., eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Sylvia Laibman Horwitz, a world traveler, an author and a founder of two schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Paul Horwitz.         When the guns stopped firing in Europe in 1945, Mrs. Horwitz was part of one of the first boatloads of American civilians headed for Italy to join spouses on special assignment on the war-ravaged continent. Her husband, Louis Horwitz, a social worker, was working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in the resettlement of refugees.         She quickly found that the disarray of postwar Rome extended to newcomers as well as to survivors. There was no school for English-speaking children, so she helped start one and served as its first director. The Overseas School of Rome is still in operation. She had already helped found the Downtown Community School, a private elementary school in Greenwich Village, in the early 1940's.         Her tenure in Rome also kindled an interest in archeology.         When her husband was posted in Tunisia, she began to explore the past of her new home and the site of ancient Carthage. Study there and later in Tiberias inspired her third book, "The Find of a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Evans and the Discovery of Knossos" (Viking, 1980). It celebrated the discoveries of one of history's greatest amateur archeologists, Arthur Evans, who uncovered evidence of a Minoan civilization in Crete dating back to 3500 B.C.         She also wrote the books "Toulouse-Lautrec: His World" (Harper, 1973) and "Francisco Goya: Painter of Kings and Demons" (Harper, 1974).         She was born in Newcastle, Pa., and grew up in Cleveland. She graduated from Case Western University in 1932 and moved to Manhattan, where she was a copywriter. Later, she was a teacher at the New School for Social Research.         Her husband died in 1979. In addition to her son, of Concord, Mass., she is survived by a sister, Natalie Barr of Lamoine, Me., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Wednesday about Sylvia Laibman Horwitz of Manhattan, an author and founder of two schools who died on June 18, misidentified the college she attended. Mrs. Horwitz graduated in 1932 from Flora Stone Mather College for Women, not from Case Western Reserve University. The women's college later became part of a university that helped form Case Western Reserve University in 1967.       
         Vera Aberle Ries, whose living room was lined from floor to ceiling with one of the country's richest private collections of early children's books, died at her home in Forest Hills, Queens, on Monday. She was 86.         Mrs. Ries's husband, Ludwig, began the collection in 1958 with trips to New England villages to rummage at antique stores and thrift shops. Mrs. Ries continued the search after his death in 1968, working mainly through catalogues.         The collection boasts about 3,000 books published between 1600 and 1850, many of them bearing childish scrawls and dogeared pages. Among the books were a moth-eaten first American edition of "Little Goody Two Shoes," a 1780 Bible no bigger than a man's thumb, New England primers, books with paper dolls and collections of fairy tales, along with standbys like "Robinson Crusoe" and "Alice in Wonderland."         "The wonderful thing about this kind of collecting," Mrs. Ries once said, "is that you are giving life to books that otherwise would have rotted away in an attic somewhere."         Born in Frankfurt, Mrs. Ries received a law degree from the University of Frankfurt and arrived in Forest Hills with her husband in the late 1930's. She did not practice law but joined her husband in a window-display business. Together, they worked at some of New York's most fashionable department stores.         Mrs. Ries is survived by her daughter, Dr. Jane Ries Pitt Socolow of Princeton, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland, an official of the Central African Republic who served as its Minister of Social Affairs in 1992 and 1993 after being imprisoned for five years for political reasons, died on June 4 in a hospital in Paris. She was 58.         Her death was reported in the Friday issue of Le Monde, which did not give the cause.         She was trained as a teacher and became the director of social services in the republic's army, an adviser to the Prime Minister on women's issues and a campaigner on behalf of homeless children in Bangui, the republic's capital.         Her outspokenness was not tolerated for a time by the republic's military ruler, Gen. Andre Kolingba, who stepped down in 1993. After being imprisoned from 1986 to 1991, she went on to join the Cabinet, but left it before a presidential election in 1993, in which she was an unsuccessful candidate.         She was married and had five children.       
         May Sarton, poet, novelist and the strongest of individualists, died on Sunday at the York Hospital in York, Me., the town in which she had lived for many years. She was a stoical figure in American culture, writing about love, solitude and the search for self-knowledge. She was 83.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said Susan Sherman, a close friend and editor of her letters.         During a remarkably prolific career that stretched from early sonnets published in 1929 in Poetry magazine to "Coming Into Eighty" her latest collection of poems, in 1994, Ms. Sarton persistently followed her own path and was nurtured by an inner lyricism. She wrote more than 20 books of fiction and many works of nonfiction, including autobiographies and journals, a play and several screenplays. She was best known and most highly regarded as a poet.         Extremely popular on college campuses, she became a heroine to feminists. In 1965, when she revealed that she was a lesbian, she said she lost two jobs as a result. But as with so much in her life, she had no regrets.         In an interview with Enid Nemy in The New York Times in 1983, Ms. Sarton was described as "a commanding, no-nonsense figure with clear blue eyes and a shock of white hair," a woman who lived in "self-imposed loneliness" in a weathered clapboard house on the Maine coast. She had, it was said, a difficult life; her work has been virtually ignored by major critics and she gained her reputation primarily by word of mouth. The poet said, "Women have been my muse."         Recovering from a stroke, and while often in pain from other ailments, she continued to keep a journal, and in 1993 published "Encore: A Journal of the 80th Year." In it, she said, "I write poems, have always written them, to transcend the painfully personal and reach the universal." She added, "It's hard to say goodbye to journals, and if I live to be 85 I might resume one for the joy of it."         In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Sheila Ballantyne, reviewing "Anger," Ms. Sarton's 1982 novel, wrote: "It is clear that May Sarton's best work, whatever its form, will endure well beyond the influence of particular reviews or current tastes. For in it she is an example: a seeker after truth with a kind of awesome energy for renewal, an ardent explorer of life's important questions. Her great strength is that when she achieves insight, one believes -- because one has witnessed the struggle that preceded the knowledge."         Ms. Sarton was born in Wondelgem in Belgium in 1914, as Eleanore Marie Sarton. Her father was a Belgian historian of science, her mother an English artist and designer. With the outbreak of World War I, the Sartons emigrated to England and, in 1916, to the United States, where her name was Anglicized to Eleanor May Sarton. As she later recalled in "I Knew a Phoenix: Sketches for an Autobiography," her mother carried with her from Belgium a copy of "Leaves of Grass," and passed on a love of poetry to her daughter.         In 1918, the Sartons settled in Cambridge, Mass. At Shady Hill School in Cambridge, the young woman explored her passion for poetry, and then fell into difficulty at high school because she objected to a teacher's statement that Ibsen was immoral. The fact that she did not go to college was, she said, "a great piece of luck; this way, I'm ignorant but I'm fresh." Stage-struck, she joined Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater as an actress. After the company disbanded in the early 1930's, she founded the Apprentice Theater of the New School for Social Research. When her theater failed, she made frequent trips back to Europe, and continued to re-envision her experiences in poetry.         During the 1930's, two volumes of poetry, "Encounter in April" and "Inner Landscape," and a novel, "The Single Hound," established themes that were to occupy her for a lifetime: the many forms of love and the uniqueness of the individual. To support her art, she wrote book reviews and taught creative writing. Her second novel, "The Bridge of Years," published in 1946, was seemingly drawn from life, dealing with the effect of two world wars on a Belgian family. Many of her subsequent novels, including "The Small Room," "Crucial Conversations" and "A Reckoning," centered on women as protagonists. In these novels as well as in her poems, she confronted issues that foreshadowed feminist writing of subsequent decades.         For Ms. Sarton, poetry was her life's work. As she said: "When you're a poet, you're a poet first. When it comes, it's like an angel." Although she never had the full recognition attained by many of her peers, and never won a Pulitzer Prize or a National Book Award, her work generally received favorable reviews and she had a loyal readership. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received 18 honorary degrees.         In "Encore," she admitted to being hypersensitive about criticism. As she once said, referring to a review of her novel, "A Reckoning," a bad review "is a drop of poison and slowly gets into the system, day by day." But nothing could discourage her from writing, not even a series of illnesses. Through her later years, she chronicled her life in journals. In "After the Stroke," a journal published in 1988, she wrote that she had discovered "for the first time perhaps what it takes to grow old," and, approaching 75, was determined to "recover and go on creating."         Speaking about the "rewards of a solitary life," she said, "Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences -- differences of taste, temperament, mood." Quietly she waited for the moment to come "when the world falls away, and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious, bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood, when I can converse again with my own hidden powers, and so grow, and so be renewed, till death do us part." Of Solitude, Mortality, Liberals, Friends and Fires  Fruit of Loneliness         Now for a little I have fed on loneliness         As on some strange fruit from a frost-touched vine --         Persimmon in its yellow comeliness,         Or pomegranate-juice color of wine,         The pucker-mouth crab apple, or late plum --         On fruit of loneliness I have been fed.         But now after short absence I am come         Back from felicity to the wine and bread.         For, being mortal, this luxurious heart         Would starve for you, my dear, I must admit,         If it were held another hour apart         From that food which alone can comfort it --         I am come home to you, for at the end         I find I cannot live without you, friend.         From "Words on the Wind" ("Encounter in April," Houghton-Mifflin, 1937)         I watched the psychic surgeon         Stern, skilled, adroit,         Cut deep into the heart         And yet not hurt. . . .         Old failures, old obsessions         Cut Away. . . .         From "Letter to a Psychiatrist"         Here in Maine it is a cold start to the new year as a tempestuous ocean throws up fountains of spray at the end of my field and its ice on the dirt roads where I walk Tamas, my dog. But the cold is not only in the weather -- after all, we expect that, and we are bundled up; the cold is in the heart. I cannot remember a year when I was more aware of suffering and need, more aware of the botch governments make of human lives, more aware of my own helplessness as though the fire in me had frozen at the center.         When Tamas comes in from the snow, he shakes himself, and this evening I tell myself, as the moon rises in a brief respite from storm, that I must find a way to shake myself out of the frozen mood and start the fire going again. Hard times tempt one to run for cover and hide, wait it out, give up trying to act in the face of gigantic problems no one of us is equipped to solve. The temptation is to withdraw.         But, I tell myself, that is not what being a liberal is all about, however put down and cast aside we may be at the moment. Anger lights the fire when I see some people hanging their heads, allowing themselves to be persuaded that government cannot concern itself with the poor, the disabled, the old, the children. We may have failed, but if so we failed because we did too little, not too much.         We have got to warm ourselves back to the certainty that it is only when we lose the connection between ourselves and other people that we begin to freeze up into despair. That connection has to be kept open whatever happens. It is kept open by letters, by unexpected encounters, or by simply contemplating the points of light here or there.         From "Winter Thoughts" (The New York Times, 1982)         "Music I heard with you was more than music." Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience.         Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences -- differences of taste, temperament, mood. Human intercourse often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel absolutely.         From "Rewards of a Solitary Life" (The New York Times, 1990)       
         Virginia Mae Morrow, the Colorado woman whose hypnosis-induced recollections created a sensation in the 1950's, died on July 12 at a hospice outside Denver. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Richard, said.         According to Mrs. Morrow's own recollections, she had died before, after falling down a flight of stairs in Ireland in 1864, when she was known as Bridey Murphy.         Whether Mrs. Morrow really had a past life as Bridey Murphy, or even if there was a Bridey Murphy who lived the life Mrs. Morrow so vividly described in a thick Irish brogue during in taped hypnotic sessions in 1952 and 1953, has been the subject of intense emotional debate for more than four decades.         The debate began when her story was first told in articles by William J. Barker in The Denver Post in 1954, and it engaged a far wider audience when "The Search for Bridey Murphy" was published by Doubleday in 1956 and made into a movie the same year.         The book was by Morey Bernstein, the amateur hypnotist who had elicited the recollections in Pueblo, Colo. It became a best seller and was reissued in 1965 with additional material by Mr. Barker, but has been out of print for several years.         Whether Mrs. Morrow's account was dismissed out of hand or accepted as proof of reincarnation, Bridey Murphy became a 1950's phenomenon rivaling the Hula-Hoop. There were Bridey Murphy parties ("come as you were") and Bridey Murphy jokes (parents greeting newborns with "Welcome back").         The book triggered an interest in reincarnation and the use of hypnosis to regress a subject to early childhood, and perhaps beyond. It also spawned efforts to debunk Mrs. Morrow's recollections.         The notion that the book was an out-and-out hoax never gained much credence for several reasons. Mr. Bernstein, for example, was a wealthy and highly respected Pueblo businessman who had been experimenting with hypnosis for years.         His hypnosis sessions with Mrs. Morrow, which began on a lark after a party, were conducted in front of respected witnesses who vouched for the apparent authenticity of Mrs. Morrow's regression.         Also, Mrs. Morrow, then a 27-year-old mother of two known as Ginny Tighe, seemed an entirely guileless subject. She insisted that her real name not be used in the book, which called her Ruth Simmons, and then shunned virtually every opportunity to cash in on the Bridey Murphy phenomenon.         Efforts to debunk Bridey Murphy focused on the assumption that her detailed recollections an Irish life a century earlier were simply an outpouring of long-forgotten childhood memories.         In the 1965 edition, Mr. Barker took on the debunkers point by point. Yes, for example, as a child in Chicago Mrs. Morrow had lived across the street from a woman named Bridey (a common diminutive of Bridget), but so what? Mrs. Morrow said she had never known the woman's first name.         As for the visiting aunt of Scotch-Irish extraction who supposedly regaled her with tales from Ireland, the woman was born in New York and had no special interest in Ireland, and Mrs. Morrow was 18, not an impressionable toddler, when she was around.         Mrs. Morrow, whose original name was Reese, was born in Madison, Wis., on April 27, 1925, and raised by an aunt and uncle in Chicago. After studying at Northwestern University, she went with a friend to Denver, where she got a job and met her first husband, Hugh Tighe, who was later transferred to Pueblo.         They later moved back to the Denver area and were divorced.         Whatever the explanation of her highly detailed recollections, the one person who seemed immune to the debate was Mrs. Morrow.         As for all the fuss she had kicked up, she once said, "If I had known what was going to happen I would never have lain down on the couch."         In addition to her husband, of Englewood, Colo., Mrs. Morrow is survived by the three children from her first marriage, Marilou Butler of Valdosta, Ga., Nanci Lee of Hong Kong and Teri Francis of San Jose, Calif.; two stepchildren, Pam Zimmer of El Cajon, Calif., and Randy Morrow of Littleton, Colo., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Erika Lehnsen, one of the first art therapists to work with children, died on Sunday at the Andrus retirement home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Until recently, Miss Lehnsen, who was 90, was a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Miss Lehnsen and her associates, including Elinor Ulman and Bernard Levy, were among the founders of the art therapy field.         Born in a small town near Berlin, she studied at an innovative school where practicing artists taught free and applied art. After Nazi persecution prompted her departure from Germany, she joined her brother in Guatemala, where he had founded a boarding school. There, she taught art and art appreciation and discovered her interest in the artwork of young children.         She moved to the United States in 1954 and received a master's degree in psychology at the New School for Social Research. She worked for 14 years at Montefiore Medical Center before retiring 20 years ago.       
         Susan McAllister Swap, an educator and writer who focused on involving parents in their children's schools, died last Thursday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 50.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         Dr. Swap joined the faculty of Wheelock College in Boston in 1977 and taught courses in child development, special education, consultation and parent studies. A past chairwoman of the department of professional studies, she was a professor of education and psychology.         Most recently she directed the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, and the Center on College-School-Community Partnerships, two research programs at Wheelock.         She wrote articles about home-school partnerships and promoting the academic success of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Her books in print are "Managing an Effective Interview Program" (Teachers College, 1984), "Parent Involvement and Success for All Children: What We Know Now" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), "Schools Reaching Out and Success for All Children: Two Case Studies" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), and "Developing Home-School Partnerships: From Concept to Practice" (Teachers College, 1993).         Born in Bridgeport, Conn., she graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College and earned her Ph.D. in education and psychology at the University of Michigan. She taught at Tufts University before moving to Wheelock.         Dr. Swap is survived by her husband, Walter; a son, Clifford; a daughter, Alison, all of Winchester; her parents, John and Pauline McAllister of Fairfield, Conn.; two sisters, Joan Howard of Winterville, Ga., and June McAllister of Stratford, Conn., and a brother, Jef McAllister of Great Falls, Va.       
         Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala. By her own reckoning she was about 85.         When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.         Mrs. Logan, the 14th of 16 children, was born on a farm in Marengo County, outside Sweet Water, about 120 miles north of Mobile.         On the surface, her life was little different from those of other black women of her era in southern Alabama. As a child she picked cotton, sewed and ironed to make money for her family. And for all her infectious optimism and perpetual good cheer, even as a "granny," as midwives were known in the South, Mrs. Logan, the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, was hardly unique.         In 1910, about half of the births in the United States were assisted by midwives, and the percentage was far higher in the rural south. Their clients were generally so poor that even Mrs. Logan, who delivered virtually every child born in the predominantly black Mobile suburb of Prichard from 1931 to 1984, had to supplement her income by working as a maid.         What ultimately set Mrs. Logan apart was not her work, but her compelling sense that hers was a story that had to be told. Or, as she put it, "I just got so much experience in here that I just want to explode."         Although she was barely literate, Mrs. Logan said she was so determined to tell it she would be prepared to "scratch it out" herself.         That proved unnecessary when a family she worked for introduced her to Katherine Clark, a young Harvard graduate who came to Mobile in 1984 to teach English at the University of South Alabama and is now a professor of English at the University of New Orleans.         "As soon as I met her, I knew there was a book in her," Professor Clark said yesterday, recalling that she had taped 100 hours of Mrs. Logan's recollections before editing them into what became "Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story" (Dutton, 1989).         The book, still in print as a Plume paperback, was widely praised both for its vivid accounts of Mrs. Logan's life told in her distinctive vernacular and for her unflinchingly optimistic spirit in the face of pervasive adversity.         "Motherwit" made Mrs. Logan something of a folk hero, and two years ago she was represented along with Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Frank, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Joan Didion and other feminist luminaries in "The Norton Book of Women's Lives" (Norton, 1993).         Although lay midwives were outlawed by the state of Alabama in 1976, Mrs. Logan had attained such stature in Mobile that she was allowed to continue her practice under a permit from local authorities until 1984, when she received an abrupt notice telling her there was no longer a need for her services.         Mrs. Logan, who had delivered babies for almost two decades before receiving a state license in 1949, retired from her profession, but refused to abandon her calling. Despite all the advances in medical services to the poor, she knew that midwives were too often not the alternative to hospitals, but to husbands.         "They're not going to stop me from doing the gift that God give me to do," she said. "I don't be going there on no license. I be going there as a friend to help that husband deliver his baby."         Mrs. Logan, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Roosevelt Logan; a son, Johnnine Watkins of Moss Point, Miss; a sister, Louise Blackman of Pensacola, Fla.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. She was 92.         A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."         In the 1930's, she conducted seminal research on childhood development with Arnold Gesell at Yale University. In the 1940's and 1950's, as a member of N.Y.U.'s faculty, she served on virtually every city, state and national conference devoted to children and wrote widely on the subject.         And in the 1960's, while winding down her wide-ranging academic career as a professor at Wheelock College in Boston, she became the Massachusetts regional training officer for Head Start, the Federal program designed to provide disadvantaged children with the preschool enrichment Miss Keliher had been preaching to parents and educators for decades.         Although she trained teachers at N.Y.U. from 1936 to 1960, World War II provided her with her major platform.         As director of child and youth services of the New York Office of Civilian Defense, and secretary of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's Committee on the Wartime Care of Children, Miss Keliher helped make day care an accepted staple of American life.         Her campaign for day care may have made her a legitimate feminist heroine, but Miss Keliher, who also helped lessen the burden on mothers by spearheading the development of kindergarten and nursery school, made it clear that her focus was not women, but their children.         Instead of talking about what "working mothers need," she said in 1949, the emphasis should be on "what makes a good next generation for America."         A native of Washington who received her teacher's certificate after two years of training, Miss Keliher was only 20 when she became a teacher in 1923. After four years in the Washington school system, she decided she could serve children better by teaching their teachers how to teach.         Obtaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in three years at Teachers College at Columbia University, she joined Dr. Gesell in 1930. She secured the job with the renowned child psychologist, she later confided, because she was the only applicant who knew how to operate a movie camera, a skill needed in research based on close observation of minute changes in infant behavior.         For all her dedication to her work, Miss Keliher's abiding passion was opera, and for decades she was a fixture in the center of the first row of the first balcony at the Metropolitan Opera (at just over 5 feet tall, she needed an unobstructed view), where her frequent guest was Eleanor Roosevelt.         The two women, who became friends when Mrs. Roosevelt took an apartment in Miss Keliher's building near Washington Square Park, enjoyed trading favors: Mrs. Roosevelt let Miss Keliher take her N.Y.U. students on field trips to the Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park. Miss Keliher, who had the larger oven, let Mrs. Roosevelt roast her turkeys in her kitchen.         Miss Keliher also shared Mrs. Roosevelt's devotion to human rights.         In a little-known chapter of her life, her lawyer, J. Dan O'Neill, said yesterday, Miss Keliher helped several Jewish families escape from Germany and Austria in the late 1930's. Her lawyer said the enterprise was organized by the love of her life, a shadowy American intelligence agent whose death in World War II led Miss Keliher to vow to remain unmarried.         Miss Keliher later created a furor when she refused to attend an education conference at a club known to exclude Jews. And she was such an outspoken champion of women, including their need for birth-control devices, Mr. O'Neill said, that she became a virtual pariah to her own Roman Catholic Church.         For all her books, like "Life and Growth" and "A Critical Study of Homogenous Grouping," Miss Keliher stressed a single theme, one she summed up in 1955: "If I could say just one thing to parents, it would be simply that a child needs someone who believes in him no matter what he does."         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Clarice Blackburn, an actress and television writer, died at her home in Manhattan on Saturday. She was 74 and also had a home in Cutchogue, L.I.         The cause was cancer, said Marge Berson, her friend and executor.         Ms. Blackburn was born in San Francisco and earned a bachelor's degree in speech and drama from the Texas State College for Women. She made her professional debut in 1947 on Martha's Vineyard in "The Circle of Chalk."         Her performance in an Equity Library Theater production of "The Great Big Doorstep" (1950) led to a job as an understudy for "The Happy Time" on Broadway. She had lead roles in "The Grass Harp" and "American Gothic" at Circle in the Square in 1953 and played Shirley Booth's wisecracking co-worker in "Desk Set" on Broadway in 1955.         She also appeared in "Juno" (1959), "The Miracle Worker" (1961), "The Queen and the Rebels" (1965) and "Good Day" (1965).         Ms. Blackburn won praise for her performance as Zeena, the sickly wife in a television production of "Ethan Frome" in 1960. She was a regular on the soap operas "As the World Turns" and "Dark Shadows." As part of the writing team for the soap opera "All My Children," she won Emmy Awards in 1985 and 1988.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Singer Kaplan, a pioneer in the field of sex therapy and founder of the country's first clinic for sexual disorders established at a medical school, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Kaplan was considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods.         She agreed with others in the field that sexual difficulties often had superficial origins. But she held that, in case an unconscious conflict lay at the root of the disorder, it could indicate deep emotional problems and require the therapist to resort to more analytical means.         Consequently, her approach was seen as psychosexual therapy, to distinguish it from sex therapy. And her arrival on the scene manifested the way psychoanalysts gradually adapted to new sex-therapy techniques.         Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice.         Working as a clinical professor of psychiatry, she became the founder, in 1970, of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, one of the country's most prominent psychiatric clinics and part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center complex. She remained its director until her death.         Born Helen Singer in Vienna on Feb. 6, 1929, she came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen in 1947. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Syracuse University in 1951 and earned a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1952. She got a Ph.D in psychology in 1955 at Columbia.         In 1959, she received her medical degree from New York Medical College, where she completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis in 1970.         She trained in clinical psychology at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics in Montrose, N.Y., and the Bronx, interned at Bronx Hospital and completed her training as a fellow of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College-Metropolitan Hospital Center.         There the first phase of her professional teaching career unfolded as she developed and coordinated a basic behavioral science program for psychiatric residents as well as a freshman medical course in psychiatry. She also developed and taught a required course in psychopharmacology.         From 1960 until she established her program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, she was an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and an associate attending psychiatrist at Metropolitan, Flower and B.S. Coler Hospitals. At Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center she also served as chief of psychosomatic and consultation services, co-director of the Behavior Therapy Unit, chairman of the Behavioral Science Teaching Program and director of a program for women residents with children.         She established new programs, including one to train the psychiatric and obstetrics-gynecology staff in human sexuality.         She was appointed a professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1970. Aside from directing her program at the Payne Whitney, she was in charge of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry and curriculum development until 1976.         Her human sexuality program included an outpatient clinic for the evaluation and treatment of psychosexual disorders. This generated clinical materials for postgraduate training courses for enrolled physicians and mental-health professionals. Dr. Kaplan was in charge of all education and training programs in human sexuality for Cornell medical students and psychiatric residents at the Payne Whitney.         Dr. Kaplan was credited with 110 publications and 127 lectures and presentations taking in the full range of her specialty.         Several of her books remain in print. These include "New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions" (Random House, 1974), "Disorders of Sexual Desires and Other New Concepts and Techniques in Sex Therapy" (Brunner-Mazel, 1979), "The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects" (Brunner, 1983), "The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy" (Brunner; 2d ed., 1987), "How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation" (Brunner, 1989), and, with Donald F. Klein, "Sexual Aversion, Sexual Phobias and Panic Disorder" (Brunner, 1987).         Dr. Kaplan is survived by her husband of 15 years, Charles P. Lazarus; two sons, Dr. Phillip Kaplan and Dr. Peter Kaplan, a daughter, Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio, all of the Upper East Side; a brother, Frank Singer of California, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 23, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Saturday of Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, omitted a survivor. She is Sofie Kane of Manhattan, Dr. Kaplan's mother.       
         Alice Greenough Orr, who broke horses as a youngster on a Montana ranch, delivered mail through snowdrifts on horseback as a teen-ager and later reigned for two decades as the rodeo queen of the bronc riders, died on Sunday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 93 and a member of both the Cowboy and the Cowgirl Halls of Fame.         In a career that took her from the wilds of Montana to Madison Square Garden and the capitals of Europe, Mrs. Orr was always at home on a horse. If it was bucking, so much the better.         When she was a child growing up on a ranch near Red Lodge, Mont., her father regularly gave her wild horses, knowing that by the time they got tired of trying to dislodge his tenacious daughter, they would be tame enough for regular people to ride.         In time, her skill would lead to four world saddle bronc championships and make her a star attraction on rodeo tours in the United States, Australia and Europe.         Although bronc riding was her specialty, she and her little sister, Marge Henderson, excelled at virtually every rodeo event from trick riding to bull riding. Together with their brothers Bill and Turk, they became known as the Riding Greenoughs. Like Turk, a legendary bronc rider who died in June at the age of 89, Mrs. Orr also did occasional stunt work for the movies.         Her skill brought her considerable attention. On one European tour in the 1930's she had tea with the Queen of England, and, without benefit of sword, rode fighting bulls into Spanish arenas before dismounting and leaving them to the matadors.         Mrs. Orr, who once said she had been "born liberated," dropped out of school to take over a 35-mile rural mail route at the age of 14. She kept the route for three winters and two summers and had her heart set on a career as a forest ranger until the return of servicemen from World War I closed off such employment opportunities for women.         After the failure of her marriage to Ray Cahill, which produced two children, Mrs. Orr was working in a rooming house in 1929 when she read an advertisement for bronc riders for a wild west show, the precursor of modern rodeos.         She and her sister answered the advertisement and were hired on the spot.         Early competitors were sometimes shortchanged by tour operators, at least until 1936, when Mrs. Orr and others formed what is now known as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.         In the 1940's she and her second husband, Joe Orr, operated their own rodeos, with Mrs. Orr providing exhibitions of saddle bronc riding, a specialty that rodeo experts say requires so much more skill and finesse than bareback riding that it no longer exists as a competitive event on the women's rodeo circuit.         Mrs. Orr retired from rodeos in 1954, but continued to accept occasional movie assignments until she was 80. She climbed into the saddle for the last time in 1992 when she rode in a parade in Red Lodge, where few of those who lined the route could remember the time when it was a girl on horseback who delivered the mail.         In addition to her sister, also of Tucson, she is survived by a son, Jay Cahill of Grandview, Mo.; 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Niuta Titus, whose philanthropy fostered culture and medical research, died on Tuesday in Gstaad, Switzerland, while on vacation. Mrs. Titus, who lived in Manhattan, was 82.         With her husband, Roy V. Titus, the former chairman of the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics empire, who died in 1989, Mrs. Titus supported endeavors like the film program at the Museum of Modern Art, biochemistry at Duke University and ophthalmological research at the Wilmer Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.         She was the president of the Roy and Niuta Titus Foundation, an honorary trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, a director of the Children's Blood Foundation, president of the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem, a member of the international board of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and honorary director of the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which is devoted to the health, education and welfare of women and children.         Many film buffs in New York have pursued their passion at institutions supported by Mr. and Mrs. Titus. Among them were the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the Film Forum as well as the Museum of Modern Art. In 1976, at a time of pressing financial problems for the museum, Mr. Titus and his wife donated $1 million to renovate its 37-year-old auditorium and for its endowment. Six years later, the couple sponsored a second theater, and the auditoriums are named for them.         Despite her high-visibility projects, Mrs. Titus was not a public figure. She enjoyed the company of friends and, in particular, liked a good game of bridge.         She was a member of the Regency Whist Club and the Cavendish Club, a private bridge club, where she met Mr. Titus after she had been widowed twice. They were married in 1960. Twenty years later, they were both still playing bridge at the club.         Mrs. Titus was born in Lithuania, where she grew up. Before World War II, she lived in Paris with her first husband, Benno Slesin, the general manager for Europe for Warner Brothers.         She came to the United States in 1940, and after Mr. Slesin died in an airplane crash in 1947, she marriedBernard Miller, a cutlery manufacturer in England. He died in 1953.         Mrs. Titus is survived by two children of her first marriage, Louis E. Slesin of Manhattan, and Suzanne Slesin Steinberg of Manhattan, an assistant editor in the Home section of The New York Times; and three grandchildren.       
         Lee Hadley, an Iowa State English professor who helped turn a collaborative pedagogical sendup into an acclaimed literary career as half of a writing team known to young readers as Hadley Irwin, died on Tuesday at her home in Madrid, Iowa. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said her collaborator, Annabelle Irwin, a retired Iowa State professor.         In the arcane world of children's literature in which 8-to-12-year-olds are termed middle-aged and a 17-year-old is deemed to have one teen-age foot in the grave, the Hadley Irwin books were aimed at audiences aged 12 to 16, known as young adults.         Specializing in a subgenre known as problem novels, they wrote about teen-agers dealing with such distinctly adult themes as racism ("Kim/Kimi"), suicide ("So Long at the Fair") and alcoholism ("Can't Hear You Listening").         Even those themes were considered tame compared with that of "Abby, My Love," their breakthrough 1985 novel that stunned the industry as the first in children's literature to deal with incest.         As collaborators, the women justified their fused pen name by writing in such a seamless voice that it was impossible to tell where Ms. Hadley left off and Mrs. Irwin began.         No wonder. The women, who began their books at Mrs. Irwin's lakeside home during summer vacations then revised during the school year, sometimes sat side by side at the same typewriter finishing each other's sentences.         "She was better at characters, and I was better at plots," Mrs. Irwin said.         Ms. Hadley, a wiry, energetic woman who never married, and the older, plumper Mrs. Irwin, the mother of four children, were a study in contrasts when they took their collaboration on the road with a series of tag-team speeches to education and publishing conferences.         Ms. Hadley, an Iowa native, graduated from Drake University and received a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin. She spent seven years teaching at a junior college in New Jersey before she joined the Iowa State faculty to teach creative writing in 1969, a year before Mrs. Irwin, a former elementary school teacher, arrived.         Mrs. Irwin traced their collaboration to their experience as the only members of a faculty committee whose sole product was a jointly written final report, a spoof they peppered with such leaden jargon as "cognitive learning."         The dean was not unamused. "We weren't fired," Mrs. Irwin said.         With more than a dozen books still in print and a new one, "Sarah With an H," which deals with anti-Semitism, coming soon from their publisher, the Simon & Schuster McElderry imprint, the women had strong steady sales, but not enough to give up their teaching jobs.         Hadley Irwin was never more than a sideline for Ms. Hadley. Her main focus was her teaching, a task she accomplished with such flair that she was the only woman on the Iowa State faculty who was made a full professor without benefit of a doctorate.         In a field where creative-writing teachers are judged by the published authors they train, Ms. Hadley assured herself a measure of instant success. In a class on magazine writing, she promised an A to any student who produced an acceptance check from a magazine and always had two or three students who made the grade.         She is survived by a sister, Mildred Rich of Oskaloosa, Iowa.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Ida Lupino, an earthy, intelligent movie actress who created a luminous gallery of worldly wise villainesses, gangster's molls and hand-wringing neurotics, died on Thursday night at her home in Burbank, Calif. She was 77 years old.         Miss Lupino had cancer and had recently suffered a stroke, Mary Ann Anderson, her former secretary, said yesterday.         The actress was also celebrated for directing eight provocative and socially relevant feature films and scores of episodes of many long-running television series, including "The Untouchables," "Have Gun, Will Travel" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         In the course of more than 50 films, Miss Lupino was a spiteful Cockney in "The Light That Failed" (1939), a crazed wife in "They Drive by Night" (1940), a loyal girlfriend in "High Sierra" (1941), an escaped convict in "The Sea Wolf" (1941) and a steely murderer in "Ladies in Retirement" (1941).         In later roles, she was a depraved warden in "Women's Prison" (1955), a sob-sister columnist in "While the City Sleeps" (1956) and the world-weary mother of a rodeo star in "Junior Bonner" (1972). Vincent Canby of The New York Times called "Junior Bonner" "a superior family comedy" made to order for both Steve McQueen and Robert Preston, but wrote "the loveliest performance is that of Miss Lupino."         In the early 1950's, she directed and helped write successful low-budget movies on such sensitive issues as illegitimacy ("Not Wanted"), rape ("Outrage") and pathological murder ("The Hitch-Hiker").         On television, she regularly starred in a dramatic anthology, Four Star Playhouse, from 1952 to 1956. In 1957 and 1958 she produced "Mr. Adams and Eve," a situation comedy about married film stars, in which her co-star was Howard Duff, her third husband. Many of the episodes dealt comically with their real-life experiences.         Ida Lupino was born in London on Feb. 4, 1918, during a German zeppelin bombing. Her paternal forebears were traveling players and puppeteers in Renaissance Italy. Later generations migrated to England in the 17th century. Her father, Stanley Lupino, was a noted comedian, and her mother, Connie Emerald, was an actress who was also descended from a theatrical family. A cousin, Lupino Lane, was an internationally popular song-and-dance man.         As a child, she improvised and acted scenes with her younger sister, Rita, in a small theater their father had built for them in their London garden. Her roles included Juliet, Camille and even Hamlet. At the age of 13, she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At 15, she made her film debut in a Lolita-like role in "Her First Affaire." She made five more movies in Britain in 1933, then signed a contract with Paramount Pictures in Hollywood and played a dozen more sugary ingenues over the next five years.         The turning point came with "The Light That Failed," in which she forcefully played a vengeful prostitute who betrays an artist going blind (Ronald Colman). That performance and her next one, as a demented murderer in "They Drive by Night," won her a long-term contract at Warner Brothers.         Over the next decade, critics increasingly hailed Miss Lupino as one of the great film actresses. Her favorite role was in "Ladies in Retirement," as a stolid housekeeper who kills her overbearing employer so she can use the house as a sanctuary for her two insane sisters. The New York film critics honored her as the best actress of 1943 for her portrayal in "The Hard Way" of a ruthless woman who propels her younger sister to stardom and destroys everyone in her way.         Miss Lupino gracefully disguised the intense effort she put into shaping her roles, displaying an economy of motion and an ease in using precisely on-target gestures and intonation. She insisted she was not a born actress, saying: "I study and work hard. I take a script and mull over it and underline the bits I want to emphasize. When I go on the set, I know exactly what I want to do and how I want to do it."         In 1949, Miss Lupino and Collier Young, a movie executive and producer who was then her husband, founded Filmakers, an independent production company, for which she directed candid films with feminist themes. One of the most popular was "The Bigamist" (1953).         The energetic Miss Lupino called directing the most demanding work in films, requiring tactful but firm handling of many temperaments and giving clear instructions to a usually all-male, often skeptical crew. Though she spent many hours at what was then a man's calling, she was unstintingly feminine in bearing and manner, observing, "I'm not the kind of woman who can bark orders."         Miss Lupino was petite, standing only 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 112 pounds. She had auburn hair and violet eyes framed by half-inch-long lashes. Her leisure pursuits included skin diving, writing short stories and children's books, and composing music. One work, "Aladdin Suite," was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.         She was married to (and divorced from) the actor Louis Hayward (1938 to 1945) as well as Mr. Young (1948 to 1951). She and Howard Duff were married in 1951 and divorced in 1983. He died in 1990.         Miss Lupino is survived by a daughter, Bridget Duff, and a sister, Rita Lupino.       
         Frances Webb Roosevelt, a portrait artist who was the mother-in-law of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 78 and lived on the Roosevelt estate, Sagamore Hill, in Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Roosevelt was the widow of President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Quentin Roosevelt.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said Ilene Hoffer, a spokeswoman for Governor Weld.         Mrs. Roosevelt was a native of Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1939. She married Quentin Roosevelt in England in April 1944, two months before her husband, an Army captain, participated in the D-Day invasion. During the war, Mrs. Roosevelt, a Red Cross worker, drew pictures of soldiers on postcards that they later sent home to their families.         After the war, the family moved to Shanghai and lived there until Quentin Roosevelt died in a plane crash near Hong Kong in 1948. Mrs. Roosevelt then moved with her children to Sagamore Hill.         A well-known portrait artist in Oyster Bay, Mrs. Roosevelt taught art at C. W. Post College in Brookville, L.I. During the late 1940's and early 1950's, she worked as a courtroom sketch artist for several newspapers and covered the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, the American diplomat who had been accused of spying for the Soviet Union.         Mrs. Roosevelt is survived by three daughters, Susan Roosevelt Weld of Boston, the wife of Governor Weld; Anna Curtenius Roosevelt of Chicago, and Alexandra Dworkin of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.       
         Harriet Bell, a polio survivor and advocate of handicapped rights who directed the Polio Information Center from her bedroom as a resource center for the country's 250,000 polio victims, died last Sunday at her home on Roosevelt Island. She was 72.         The cause was cardiac arrest, Cathie Bell, one of her daughters, said.         Crippled by polio in 1954 at the age of 31, Ms. Bell spent the next 25 years living at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, where she helped to raise her three children. As president of the community board of the hospital, Ms. Bell helped to write its patient's bill of rights.         In 1982, she received an award for her work on behalf of patients' rights from the Wonder Woman Foundation, an organization that gives grants to accomplished women over 40. In 1985, she became a co-founder of the Polio Information Center, creating the largest international data base available about the disease. She published the center's newsletter.         Ms. Bell is survived by her three children, Cathie, of Manhattan, and Lori and Douglas, both of Staten Island, and seven grandchildren.       
         Diana Chin Hsu, a veteran Chinese journalist, novelist and poet whose writings on love, suffering and tragedy are read throughout Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, died on Wednesday in Queens. She was 77.         The cause of death was stomach cancer, according to her son, Hugh H. Mo, a lawyer in New York.         As a reporter for Chinese newspapers during World War II, Ms. Hsu covered the Chinese resistance against the Japanese and her articles were widely read in the Far East. But Ms. Hsu gained wider popularity after she escaped Communist China with the three youngest of munists executed her husband, Mo Tze Shin, the director of Chiang Kai-shek's secret police force, the Shanghai Bureau of Criminal Investigation.         Her book "Mao Zedong Killed My Husband" was a best-seller in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.         In 1954, at the invitation of Chiang Ching-kuo, a son of Chiang Kai-shek who later became President of Taiwan, Ms. Hsu visited Taiwan and joined the Government newspaper, China Daily News, where she covered international politics. In 1960, Ms. Hsu became a special foreign correspondent for the paper in New York.         Ms. Hsu traveled through Asia and Europe, eventually settling in New York, and was eventually reunited with her eight children.         She went on to write seven novels, all with anti-Communist themes. Attempts by the Chinese Government to undermine her only enhanced her popularity.         In 1985, the Chinese community in New York was in an uproar when Ms. Hsu and her son, Mr. Mo, who was serving as a Deputy Police Commissioner in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, accepted an invitation from the Chinese Government and visited the mainland. Today, some pro-Taiwan Chinese have not forgiven them.         "Maybe the old generation can't sit down and break bread," Mr. Mo said after his trip to China in 1985. "But the ideological split doesn't involve me."         Ms. Hsu is survived by four daughters, LiYa Mo, Li Qun Mo and Li Guo Mo, all of New York City, and Li Min Mo of Cambridge, Mass., and two other sons, Lin H. Mo and Chi Mo of New York, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Carmen Sylva Mathews, an actress, environmentalist and philanthropist who established a summer camp for disadvantaged children, died on Thursday at her farm in Redding, Conn. She was 84 years old.         Ms. Mathews was born in Philadelphia and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She made her first professional acting appearance with the Stratford-on-Avon Shakespearean Company before moving back to the United States.         Her acting career spanned 55 years, including the roles of Ophelia in "Hamlet" and the queen in "Richard II." She played a range of characters in several Broadway shows, sharing the stage with notables like Don Ameche, Angela Lansbury and Joanne Woodward.         She appeared in countless television plays and movies and is still seen in reruns as Col. Lillian Rayborn in a popular episode of "M.A.S.H." Her last role was in "The Best Years of My Life," a 1990 television movie with Mary Tyler Moore and Bernadette Peters.         Her film credits also include "Butterfield 8," "Rage to Live," "Sounder" and "Daniel."         A passionate environmentalist, Ms. Mathews recently made a perpetual donation of her 100-acre New Pond Farm to the Redding Land Trust to insure that it would retain its woods, fields, pond and marsh.         Also in 1983, she established a summer camp for disadvantaged city children, known as the New Pond Farm Education Center. Because of her philanthropic endeavors, the United Nations named her one of Connecticut's outstanding women in 1987.       
         Annie Kriegel, a French ex-Communist who was a historian and analyst of Communism, died on Aug. 26 in a Paris hospital. She was 68 and lived in Paris.         She had cancer, said the French newspaper Le Figaro, which reported her death on Aug. 28.         Professor Kriegel had retired from academic work after teaching at the University of Paris-Nanterre from 1969 into the 1990's.         As a teen-ager, she was active in the Resistance against the Nazi occupation of her country. She became prominent in the postwar French Communist Party but resigned in 1957.         Her 1972 book, "The French Communists," was hailed in The New York Times Book review by an American historian of France, Robert O. Paxton of Columbia University, as "the most probing single work on the French Communist Party, and perhaps on any Western Communist party." She wrote more than a dozen books, beginning in 1964.         A British historian of France, Douglas Johnson, wrote in The Independent on Friday that Professor Kriegel was respected as an individual force among French intellectuals.         Professor Johnson -- whose French-born wife, Madeleine, roomed with Professor Kriegel in the 1940's -- said the explanation for her "remarkable career is to be found in her wartime experience" and gave this account:         "Coming from a Jewish-Alsatian family and having passed idyllic school days in the Marais district of Paris, she encountered the anti-Semitic legislation of the occupation and then the infamous roundup of Jews on 16 July 1942.         "As the men were forcibly separated from the women and children, she heard screams which she said contained all the pain that life and death provide. She sat on a bench and wept. 'It was on that bench that I left my childhood,' she afterwards said."         Then she escaped Paris and joined a Communist Resistance group. After the war she studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Sevres, held posts in teaching and related fields and wrote for Le Figaro.         Annie Becker Kriegel was born in Paris. Her marriage to Guy Besse ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband of 40 years, Dr. Arthur Kriegel; and four children, Maurice, Danielle, Irene and Emmanuel.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Before she made her Metropolitan Opera debut last Saturday in the title role  of Bizet's "Carmen," Denyce Graves kept telling herself that the Met was simply  another opera house. After all, she had already sung the role at the Vienna State Opera, at the Bastille Opera in Paris and at Covent Garden, 21 productions in the last two years alone.         "I tried to think of this as just another engagement," she said recently, "but nobody would let me do that."         She was referring not only to managers and the news media, but also to her family, friends and former teachers from the tough southwest Washington neighborhood where she grew up, a gritty area near a sewage treatment center and an automobile impoundment lot. More than 50 of her relatives and former neighbors traveled to New York by chartered bus for her Met debut; some 50 more  came by train and car.         For years, most people at home saw Ms. Graves as "some sort of space alien,"  she said, what with her exotic notions of becoming an opera singer. But "a Met debut was something they understood," she said, and the tumultuous standing ovation she got on Saturday night "really clinched it for them." She sings the role again this afternoon and on Wednesday and next Saturday.         Ms. Graves knows that her personal story is the kind of inspirational saga Americans love: a television crew from "60 Minutes" covered her Met debut. "This was not just a move for myself, but for my people, my family," the 30-year-old mezzo-soprano said. "I realize now that what I say affects my family, so I've become more protective of their feelings, my mother's in particular. It's not just my story; it's hers."         Ms. Graves was the second of three children. Her father, an alcoholic, abusive man, left the family when her mother was pregnant with their third child. The children did not see him for again for 18 years, when he turned up, unannounced, at the high school graduation of Ms. Graves's younger sister. By then he had become a minister. They have not heard from him since.         Left alone with three children to raise, Ms. Graves's mother found work as a  clerk-typist at the University of the District of Columbia. (Today, Mrs. Dorothy Graves Kenner, her name from a second marriage, is registrar.) She was out of the house before the children were up, and gone most of the day. "When she got home, we had to have dinner ready," Ms. Graves said. "We did the cooking, dishwashing and cleaning in rotating one-week shifts."         Yet her mother provided a rich, if regimented, family life. Participation in  their fundamentalist Baptist church was mandatory. Ms. Graves sang in the choir  and helped out at Sunday school. At home, her mother dedicated each night of the week to some educational project: one night the children would present oral book reports or speak on assigned topics (like birds, flowers or geography). Thursday was music night, when the family performed gospel as an impromptu vocal group at churches and meeting halls. Popular music of any kind was banned in the house, though Ms. Graves listened to some illicit Michael Jackson on the radio when she was alone. "My mother worked so hard," Ms. Graves said. "She didn't want her babies to be lost to the streets, like so many."         At school, Ms. Graves's singing was encouraged by a strong-willed music teacher, Judith Grove. "I adored her," Ms. Graves said. "I thought she hung the  moon." Ms. Grove directed her to the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, a public high school in Washington. She was accepted immediately. There, she received private voice lessons and attended her first opera: a dress rehearsal for Beethoven's "Fidelio," on a school expedition to the Kennedy Center.         After high school, Ms. Graves made great progress under Helen Hodam, a renowned voice teacher, first at Oberlin Conservatory, and then at the New England Conservatory. In Boston, she took side jobs to support herself: cleaning dormitories, working as an all-night hotel desk clerk. When she decided to enter the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions, she had all the makings of a finalist: a lustrous mezzo-soprano voice and a striking stage presence. But her  performance was charged with a special determination. "I had to win," she said.  "I was four months behind in my rent. I couldn't pay for the rented dress I was wearing." Ms. Graves won.         The pressure took its toll. After the competition, her voice failed her. The  problem later turned out to be a treatable thyroid condition. But her performance at the finals in New York City was "a disaster," Ms. Graves said. Demoralized, she quit singing and took a secretarial job.         Yet the word of her promise had spread. The Houston Grand Opera called to invite her to participate in its program for young artists. She declined. When they called twice more, her friends prevailed on her to accept. ("It was a sign, like something meant to be," she said.)         Since then, her success has come steadily. One of her big supporters is Placido Domingo, who sang Don Jose to her Carmen at Covent Garden. They first met in Houston when Ms. Graves sang Emilia in a production of Verdi's "Otello."  "What impressed me immediately about her, aside from her obvious vocal and physical beauty, was an aura of the dramatic about her," Mr. Domingo said recently.         "As Carmen," he continued, "she is so good that the world might want her exclusively for this role. That would be a shame, because she has very much to offer in other parts." In his capacity as future artistic director of the Washington Opera, Mr. Domingo has invited her to sing two other leading roles, which have not yet been announced.         In developing her approach to this signature role, Ms. Graves avoided listening to recordings of celebrated Carmens from the past. Moreover, she counts herself lucky to have done her first Carmen in a modern-dress production  at the Minnesota Opera.         "I didn't want to do a traditional Carmen," she said. "Carmen is an unapologetic modern woman, a woman of the 90's. She speaks constantly about her  freedom, but she is no whore. Her spirit is free. She is attracted to Don Jose precisely because he isn't interested. When she realizes she truly loves him, she becomes afraid and treats him badly. Love means losing your freedom. I think she is essentially a very sad person."         Vocally, she finds the role gratifying, but frustrating. Unlike the other characters, Carmen has no defining "stand-and-deliver aria," as Ms. Graves put it, which makes portraying her true character a challenge. "Carmen sings songs,  but these are set pieces involving other people," she said. Carmen's most famous song, the "Habanera," is a "dramatic miscalculation," according to Ms. Graves, wrongly inserted by Bizet into the score after the premiere at the insistence of the first Carmen, Celestine Galli-Marie. "It's an awkward introduction to Carmen," Ms. Graves said. "In the original version, she enters, sings her few insinuating lines, then leaves, like a black cat crossing the stage. That's much more in character."         Her recent performances include Adalgisa in "Norma" at Zurich, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" at La Scala, and Dalila in a concert performance of "Samson et Dalila" with the Chicago Symphony under James Levine. She is looking  forward to performing Marguerite in Berlioz's "Damnation of Faust" in Houston and Bonn ("I adore that music"), and hopes someday to sing Blanche in one of her favorites, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites."         The sudden attention has left Ms. Graves excited but unaffected. Greeting a visitor in her hotel suite, she curled up on the couch in an oversize sweatshirt and casually stirred gobs of honey into her tea with a dinner knife when no teaspoon was handy. As she relaxed next to her husband, David Perry, an importer of fine classical guitars, she seemed content with the way her life has turned out.         "Perhaps this should be the last interview about the past," Mr. Perry suggested. "From now on, the future will be the story." Ms. Graves nodded quietly.       
         Marilyn J. Morheuser, the lawyer at the center of a 13-year court struggle to make New Jersey's school-financing system more equitable for the state's poorest districts, died on Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, according to the Education Law Center, a Newark-based public-interest organization of which she had been executive director since 1979.         Ms. Morheuser was the agency's lead counsel for the plaintiffs in Abbott v.  Burke, a class-action suit brought in 1981 to challenge the state's Quality Education Act of 1980. Arguing on behalf of pupils of the poorest urban schools, the suit asserted that the state had inadequately responded to a State Supreme Court ruling on school financing in 1973. That ruling said that New Jersey's method of school financing violated the State Constitution by failing to guarantee parity between the poorest and the most affluent districts.         The court -- the state's highest -- agreed with the center, ruling in 1990 that the law was still unconstitutional because it did not meet the educational  needs of disadvantaged city children. It ordered that those needs be met.         The law center returned to court the next year, this time to obtain a compliance order, which the Supreme Court in Trenton handed down in 1994. In it, the judges decided that the state must increase the financing of the 30 poorest  districts to a level where their per-pupil outlays would equal the average of the wealthiest districts by fiscal year 1996-97.         The judges demanded that schools in hard-pressed cities like Newark, Camden and Paterson be provided preschool programs, health services and smaller class sizes. The state has the responsibility to provide them rather then leave it up  to the impoverished districts, they wrote.         Ms. Morheuser did not start her professional life at the bar; a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Webster College, she first was a nun. She spent 16 years teaching high school and college around the country, wherever her teaching Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of Loretto, sent her.         Being of a rather radical bent on social issues, she decided that she could achieve more on the outside. She quit the order in 1963 and became an advocate for racial equality in Milwaukee.         In 1973, she received her J.D. at the Rutgers-Newark School of Law. Before she joined the Newark law center she represented such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the Urban League and the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Her work attracted many honors, including a Special Achievement Award from the New Jersey Education Association in 1993, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the National Education Association last year. Last May, she was cited as Woman of the Year in Education by the New Jersey League of Women Voters.         Ms. Morheuser is survived by a sister, Marie Casey of St. Louis.       
         Simone Gallimard, a power in the French book-publishing world, died Monday in a clinic in Neuilly, a suburb of Paris. She was 77 and a longtime resident of Paris.         The cause was cancer, the Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Gallimard was the chief executive officer, with the title of president-director general, of the venerable Paris publishing house Mercure de France, which she had led since 1962. The house is known, among other things, for publishing works by prominent French writers and for printing French literary classics.         She was the widow of Claude Gallimard, a member of a distinguished French publishing family whom she married in 1939. Her father was a Government official, and her maiden name was Simone Cornu.         After working behind the scenes in publishing, she became the head of Mercure de France after it was purchased in 1958 by her father-in-law, Gaston Gallimard. Gaston Gallimard was the founder of the Parisian publishing house Editions Gallimard, which is now partly owned by the Gallimard family.         Mercure de France, founded in 1894, had published works by Proust and by the  poet Guillaume Apollinaire but went into a decline before Mrs. Gallimard took its helm. Under her leadership, it prospered and published books by such well-known French writers as the poet and man of letters Yves Bonnefoy, currently a visiting professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., and the poet Henri Michaux.         Mrs. Gallimard once confessed that "being a woman, bourgeois and inexperienced, I had a hard time" when she first took charge of the publishing house. But the French news agency Agence France-Presse, in reporting her death,  said that she was "the soul of Mercure de France for 33 years."         As chief executive officer, she played roles including, as Agence France-Presse put it, "editor, public relations person" and "discoverer of young authors."         She also became involved in a publishing furor. In 1975 she published a novel, "Life Before Us," which had been written, according to Agence France-Presse, by the French novelist Romain Gary using the pseudonym Emile Ajar, without her knowledge that it was a pseudonym. The book was translated into 23 languages, sold 1.3 million copies, won a French literary prize -- the Prix Goncourt -- and was made into the film "Madame Rosa."         Revelations about the novel's authorship embarrassed connoisseurs of literature who had failed to realize that Mr. Gary had written the book.         Mrs. Gallimard's survivors include her four children, Francoise, Christian, Antoine and Isabelle. Antoine and Isabelle Gallimard are executives of the publishing company.       
         Jane Lawrence Mali, an author of choldren's books, a conservationist and an educational innovatgor, died on Monday at her home in Norfolk, Conn. She was 58.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Mali was the co-author with Alison Cragin Herzig of eight children's books published in the late 1970's and 1980's. Their "Oh, Boy! Babies!" (Little Brown, 1980), a photo-documentary of a class in baby care taught at a boys' school in New York won an American Book Award in 1981 for children's hardcover non-fiction.         In the 1970's at the Collegiate School in Manhattan, Mrs. Mali pioneered the ideas of scholarships for nursery school children and a child-care class for boys. More recently, she and Mrs. Herzig helped establish a reading program at the Children's Aid Society in New York.         In 1994, Mrs. Mali was a leading donor to a nature preserve in Norfolk.         She is survived by two daughters, Adair Mali of Norfolk and Kate Mali Pingeon of Lincoln, Mass.; two sons, Taylor, of Taunton, Mass., and Peter, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; her mother, Barbara C. Lawrence of Norfolk; two sisters, Barbara L. Garside of Washington and Susannah L. Wood of Seattle; two brothers, J. Vinton Lawrence of Norfolk and Starling R. Lawrence of Manhattan, and two grandsons       
         Eleanor Aller Slatkin, a cellist admired in her own right and as part of a celebrated musical family, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         Ms. Aller was born in 1917 in New York. Her father, Gregory Aller, who was a cellist like his father, had immigrated from Russia. Ms. Aller performed in Carnegie Hall at the age of 12 and studied at the Juilliard School.         She played from 1939 to 1968 in the Warner Brothers studio orchestra. She met her husband, Felix Slatkin, a conductor and violinist and the concertmaster of the 20th Century-Fox studio orchestra, at a young artists' competition in the Hollywood Bowl; Mr. Slatkin won.         Their home, in Los Angeles, was a constant haunt of musicians and film stars ranging from Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky to Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra. And their children went on to musical careers as well: Leonard Slatkin, now in his final season as music director of the St. Louis Symphony and soon to become music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, and Frederick Zlotkin, a cellist in New York.         Together, Felix Slatkin and Ms. Aller anchored the renowned Hollywood String Quartet throughout its existence, from 1947 to 1961. The group was valued as much for its promotion of 20th-century music as for its compelling performances of classic repertory, and its recordings from the early LP era are still regarded highly.         "My first strong musical memory is of the Villa-Lobos Sixth Quartet, which my parents were rehearsing," Leonard Slatkin once said.         Ms. Aller remained active professionally after the death of her husband, in 1963. She was chairwoman of the string department at DePaul University in Chicago from 1968 to 1970.         She is survived by her sons and by two grandsons, Daniel Slatkin of Washington and Felix Zlotkin of New York.       
         Frances Grant Bennett, wife of the late Senator Wallace F. Bennett and mother of Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, died on Friday in Salt Lake City. She was 96.         Mrs. Bennett was on the primary general board of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While in Washington, she was president of the Congressional Club, a group of Congressional wives.         Frances Bennett was born on Sept. 23, 1899, to Heber J. Grant, president of  the Mormon Church and Emily Wells Grant in Salt Lake City.         She graduated from the University of Utah, and also attended Radcliffe College in Boston. In 1922, she married Wallace Bennett, who served four terms in the United States Senate and retired in 1974. He died in 1993.         Mrs. Bennett is survived by five children, 29 grandchildren and 74 great-grandchildren.       
         Johnnie Tillmon Blackston, who encountered one officious welfare inspector too many and used her anger to help change the system, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 69.         Her family said the cause was diabetes.         Mrs. Blackston turned her rage over the indignities of a belittling system into a grass-roots movement that won widespread changes and helped make the plight of welfare mothers a feminist issue. And if she did nothing else, she proved that a single mother on welfare can be a woman to be reckoned with.         A sharecropper's daughter who was born in Scott, Ark., and never made it through high school, Mrs. Blackston was accustomed to running her own life. When things went bad in Arkansas, for example, she packed up her children, left her first husband behind and struck out for California in search of a better life.         Mrs. Blackston, who worked in a Los Angeles laundry to support her six children, was not prepared for what she had to endure when she eventually went on welfare, and the system was not prepared for her.         It was the early 1960's, a time, she soon found, when welfare inspectors routinely poked through recipients' refrigerators, demanded to know where they had got the money to buy television sets and staged midnight raids to make sure  they were not harboring men, a violation of the rules for women receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children.         When Mrs. Blackston, who had been a union shop steward, took offense at such  invasions of privacy, she sat down and sent anonymous letters to her neighbors at a Watts housing project, asking those on welfare to come to a protest meeting. More than 300 people showed up.         Within months in 1963, Mrs. Blackston and her friends founded Aid to Needy Children-Mothers Anonymous, linked up with other state groups and inspired the creation of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Over the next several years it successfully campaigned for improvements, removing many of the system's paternalistic trappings and establishing welfare as an enforceable right.         Along the way, Mrs. Blackston not only shaped the national welfare debate, but also changed the very terms of the argument, transforming what had been a concern far down the agenda of the civil rights movement into a compelling feminist issue.         Noting that the vast majority of welfare recipients were women and children and likening welfare to a "supersexist marriage," Mrs. Blackston was unsparing in her analysis in addresses to welfare mothers. As she once put it:         "You trade in 'a' man for 'The' Man. But you can't divorce him if he treats you bad. He can divorce you, of course -- cut you off -- any time he wants. But  in that case, 'he' keeps the kids, not you.         " 'The' Man runs everything. In ordinary marriage, sex is supposed to be for  your husband. On A.F.D.C. you're not supposed to have sex at all. You give up control of your body. It's a condition of aid. 'The' Man, the welfare system, controls your money. 'He' tells you what to buy and what not to buy, where to buy it and what things cost."         After serving as the national organization's executive director until a lack  of money forced it to close the Washington office in 1974, Mrs. Blackston returned to California, where she worked as a legislative aid and served on state and local committees concerned with welfare.         She is survived by her second husband, Harvey Blackston; six children, Marcia Evans of Riverside, Calif., Ronald, Auluavance, Josalyn and Tanya Tillmon of Los Angeles, and Caffie Tillmon of Stockton, Calif.; 20 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Monday in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J. Kahn, who made a fortune in real estate, cotton and oil.         By the time of Mr. Kahn's death in 1984, the couple had given away $5 million, including $1 million each to their respective colleges, Smith and the University of Pennsylvania, and $1 million for the Dallas Public Library to buy  books. Since her husband's death, Mrs. Kahn had donated more than $15 million to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University and other beneficiaries. Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Mary Bruce, a teacher to generations of young tap dancers in New York and Chicago, died on Tuesday at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Miss Bruce, who lived in Manhattan, was 95.         A small, sweet-faced woman with a gimlet eye for lapses in technique and general deportment, Miss Bruce taught for a half-century in a small loft studio  on West 125th Street in Manhattan. Her students included Josephine Premice, Ruby Dee, Martina Arroyo and Marlon Brando. Miss Bruce's "Starbud" recitals for new talent, some of them held at Carnegie Hall, were a popular feature of her teaching.         Born to a family of dancers in Chicago, Miss Bruce trained in ballet but became interested in show dancing after watching a performance of Lew Leslie's "Blackbirds." She opened a school in Chicago. But when her sister Sadie opened a rival studio, she left for New York, recruiting students initially by offering tap and ballet lessons to dancers at the Savoy and other Harlem ballrooms. Throughout her career she was known for giving free lessons to children who could not afford to study.         She is survived by a sister, Evelyn, of Chicago.       
         Minnie Lee Langley, an early and persistent leader in the effort to have the  State of Florida compensate survivors of a white mob's rampage in the black settlement of Rosewood, Fla., in 1923, died on Saturday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 83 and lived in Jacksonville.         She had cancer surgery earlier in the week, her family said.         Mrs. Langley was one of the few remaining witnesses to one of the worst episodes of racial violence in Florida history. A white mob, looking for a black man accused of assaulting a white woman, was responsible for a week of burning and shooting that left at least six Rosewood residents dead and the hamlet in ruins. Two white men were also killed.         Mrs. Langley and eight other survivors received some satisfaction last year when Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, signed a bill recognizing the depravity of  the event and authorizing $150,000 in compensation for each of them. She was the lead witness in the legislative hearings, providing vivid testimony about the destruction of Rosewood. In the end, the state acknowledged that the authorities, from Gov. Cary Hardee on down, had failed to protect the hamlet's residents.         Mrs. Langley was one of several children staying in an uncle's home when the  mob closed in on a January night. They escaped through a rear door and hid shivering in the woods for several days. The mob never found the man it was looking for, and doubt remains whether any white woman had been attacked.         After moving to Jacksonville in 1926, Mrs. Langley made a living making brooms and brushes.         She is survived by a son, Anthony H. and a daughter, Dorothy Smith, both of Jacksonville; 10 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Alice Miller Bregman, who edited and wrote about children's books, died last  Wednesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 54 and had lived in Manhattan for most of her life.         The cause was cancer, according to family members.         Until August of this year, Ms. Bregman was editorial director of Artists and Writers Guild Books, a line of picture books for children that she founded at the Western Publishing Company of Racine, Wis., in 1992.         She was a frequent reviewer and contributor to a number of publications about children's literature.         Previously, Ms. Bregman was president of Bask Press, a book packager and literary agency she founded in 1983, and a former senior editor at Warner Juvenile Books and at Bantam Doubleday Dell. She worked with the writers Judy Blume, Mercer Mayer, S. E. Hinton, Paula Danziger and Norma Fox Mazer, among others.         A native of New York, she graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., with a bachelor's degree in English in 1963 and from Columbia University with a  master's in early childhood education in 1964.         Her marriage to Eric Bregman ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by her mother, Ruth Miller of Manhattan.       
         Mildred (Millie) Robinson, widow of the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson and executive director of the Sugar Ray Robinson Youth Foundation, has died. She was 77.         Mrs. Robinson died of cancer Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, the foundation's executive secretary, Thelma Miles Smith, said today.         She is survived by two children from a previous marriage, Ramona Hughes of Rosemont, Calif., and Herman Butch Robinson of Los Angeles, and two stepsons, Ronny Robinson of New York City and Ray Robinson Jr. of San Francisco.       
         Alexina Duchamp, the widow of Marcel Duchamp, died on Wednesday at her home in Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris. She was 89.         As a former daughter-in-law of Henri Matisse, the widow of Duchamp and a close friend of John Cage and Jasper Johns, she was in her later years the unquestioned doyenne of the survivors of a great age in art, dance and music.         She had close ties to Philadelphia and took pride in being an honorary trustee of its Museum of Art, which has by far the largest collection of Duchamp's work. She was delighted when in 1967 his last major work, the scenographic "Etant Donnes," or "Given," was installed there.         "Etant Donnes" had been built in secret in New York between 1964 and 1966, a  time when Duchamp was believed to have stopped working forever. During much of its construction, Mrs. Duchamp was her husband's sole confidante.         Alexina Sattler was born in Cincinnati on Jan. 6, 1906, the daughter of Dr. Robert Sattler, an ophthalmologist who ran his own hospital with a free clinic attached, and his second wife, the former Agnes Mitchell.         She at first thought of becoming an artist and for a time studied sculpture with Brancusi in Paris. In December 1929 she married the son of Henri Matisse, Pierre, who was to become a distinguished art dealer on Madison Avenue. When her husband was mobilized in Paris at the outbreak of World War II, she ran the gallery for some months.         After a divorce from Pierre Matisse in 1949, she married Duchamp in 1954. They lived in New York, in Paris and in the summer in Cadaques in northern Spain. After Duchamp's death in 1968, she became close to the composer Cage and  to a new circle of friends.         She is survived by the three children of her marriage to Matisse, Jacqueline, Paul and Peter, and by 12 grandchildren.       
         Butterfly McQueen, the actress best remembered for her portrayal of Prissy in "Gone With the Wind," the vexing slave girl who confounded Scarlett O'Hara with  the tearful pronouncement, "I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett," died yesterday. She was 84 years old.         Earlier in the day, Ms. McQueen was critically burned when a kerosene heater  in her one-bedroom cottage just outside Augusta, Ga., caught fire. She suffered  burns over 70 percent of her body and died at Augusta Regional Medical Center.         After appearing in the Civil War epic "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, Ms. McQueen's voice, squeaky and high-pitched, became her most remarked-upon characteristic, prompting one critic to describe it as a "clarinet with a cold"  and another to comment that it was an "itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension."         Although Ms. McQueen's role as Prissy earned her fame, it also brought her criticism in later years from people who considered the role stereotypical and demeaning.         "You know, today they call me an Uncle Thomasina," she said in 1970.         But Ms. McQueen, who devoted her later years to serving the African-American  community, said she also felt it necessary to acknowledge the history of black slavery in the United States.         "As I look back on "Gone with the Wind," for instance, I feel it is useful to have this authenticity," she once said. "We've got to know more about where we've come from. I wasn't too happy about the whole thing, but also later in life, as I looked around, I decided to take what I could get and then use it for what I want to do."         Born Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Fla., daughter of a housekeeper and a stevedore, Ms. McQueen first developed a fondness for acting as a child, when she would recite whole books of the Bible at home.         "All I knew as a child was church, church, church," she said.         When her parents separated, Ms. McQueen moved with her mother to Augusta, Ga., and then to New York City. As a teen-ager, she attended high school in Babylon, L.I., and later moved to Harlem.         After a brief stint in nursing school, Ms. McQueen pursued her acting career  in earnest, finding that the stage was much more exciting than a hospital. Her first break came in 1937 when George Abbott offered her a role in "Brown Sugar." The show was a flop, but Ms. McQueen signed on as a permanent member of the Abbott Acting Company.         It was during her years with the acting company that a friend dubbed her "Butterfly," after Ms. McQueen told her she had once danced a butterfly ballet in a performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."         Soon after, Mr. Abbott tailored a role for her in "What a Life," which she played on Broadway. One evening, during an intermission in Philadelphia, she received a contract from her agency for Prissy, a role she was initially rejected for after a talent scout called her too chubby. She received the good news with some reservation.         "I'd just come from a modern up-to-date integrated school in 'What a Life' and I couldn't understand why they'd want to bring back the 1800s," Ms. McQueen  said. "Most of my friends were progressive, going forward and looking forward. It was depressing for me."         Despite the success of "Gone With The Wind," Ms. McQueen found it increasingly difficult to find work in film and theater. She appeared in the films "Mildred Pierce" and "The Women," and on several radio shows. In 1951, she put on a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall, but she soon found she had to take on  other jobs to support herself. During the 1950's, she worked as a companion for  a woman in Long Island and sold toys at Macy's. At one time, she began her own radio show in Augusta, "to instill pride in the neighborhood," she said.         In 1966, still unable to find work as an actress, Ms. McQueen wrote a letter  to a Georgia congressman asking him for help in getting a job.         But it was upon her return to Harlem one year later that she found a second vocation -- helping her community. She plunged into antipoverty work and took a  job as a waitress in a soul food restaurant.         Fond of children, she worked at the Mount Morris Park Recreation Center as a  receptionist. Her distinctive voice could be heard through the corridors as she  gave tap dance and ballet lessons. She defined herself at the time through her commitment to the "black family," she said.         Ever restless and determined, Ms. McQueen, who had never completed college, graduated with a degree in political science from City College in 1975 at the age of 64.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Nov. 27 in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J. Kahn, who made a fortune in real estate, cotton and oil.         By the time of Mr. Kahn's death in 1984, the couple had given away $5 million, including $1 million each to their respective colleges, Smith and the University of Pennsylvania, and $1 million for the Dallas Public Library to buy  books. Since her husband's death, Mrs. Kahn had donated more than $15 million to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University and other beneficiaries. Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Toni Cade Bambara, a writer and documentary film maker who was celebrated for her intricate use of Black English in fiction, died on Saturday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 56 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Karma Bene Bambara of Philadelphia.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Bambara was a major contributor to the emerging genre of contemporary black women's literature, along with the writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and others. Many of her stories focused on men and women living in black neighborhoods in big cities or small Southern towns -- as  one reviewer put it, "young women and men who formed their political convictions in the fury of the 60's and find themselves gasping for air in the torpor of the 70's, manicurists, singers and students struggling to trim the rhetoric of their wishes to the smaller, tighter fit of reality."         What critics found most striking about Ms. Bambara's fiction, though, were the structure and language she used. Rather than using traditional linear plots, she would often use flashbacks, stream of consciousness and interweavings of plot and subplot to tell a story. She would frequently weave black dialects into her prose, creating a unique, complex language that was widely admired by critics.         Ms. Bambara published one novel, "The Salt Eaters," in 1980. She also edited  several anthologies and wrote several short-story collections, including "Gorilla, My Love," published in 1972, and "The Sea Birds Are Still Alive," published in 1977. Reviewing "Gorilla, My Love" for The New York Times in 1972,  C.D.B. Bryan wrote that her stories were unusual because they addressed racial issues in a tone more thoughtful than angry.         "Toni Cade Bambara tells me more about being black through her quiet, proud,  silly, tender, hip, acute, loving stories than any amount of literary polemicizing could hope to do," Mr. Bryan wrote in the review. "She writes about love: a love for one's family, one's friends, one's race, one's neighborhood, and it is the sort of love that comes with maturity and inner peace."         Ms. Bambara was born in New York City, and growing up, she spent much of her  time in public libraries. Louis Massiah, a friend and colleague in Philadelphia, said that as a child, Ms. Bambara would often visit a Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where she was inspired by two black poets: Gwendolyn Brooks, whose photograph hung there, and Langston Hughes, who she said would often come and talk to children there.         Ms. Bambara graduated from Queens College with a bachelor's degree in theater arts in 1959. In 1965, she received a master's degree in American studies from the City College of New York. She was an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1974, and she also held various teaching positions at Duke University, Atlanta University and Spelman College, among others.         From 1986 until this year, Ms. Bambara taught script writing at Scribe Video  Center in Philadelphia. Mr. Massiah said that during her tenure at the center, she helped start the careers of several black women film makers. She wrote and lectured frequently about film, stressing the importance of movies that dispel Hollywood stereotypes about blacks.         Over the last decade, Ms. Bambara also collaborated with Mr. Massiah on several television documentaries, including "The Bombing of Osage Avenue," about the police assault on Move headquarters in Philadelphia, and a biography of Cecil B. Moore, a prominent civil rights activist in Philadelphia. Her most recent project was a documentary about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois, which she worked on with Mr. Massiah and several others.         Throughout her life, Mr. Massiah said, Ms. Bambara fought for the rights of minorities, women, children and the homeless.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her mother, Helen Brehon of Queens, and a brother, Walter Cade of Queens.       
         Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.         Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.         Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing.  "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.         She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.         In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         "Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities. Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives. Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please." An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass.

The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please."         An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F.  Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."         Correction:  March 17, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Jan. 23 of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy misstated both the name and the location of the school from which she graduated in 1910. At that time, it was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart, not Manhattanville College, and it was located in Manhattanville, N.Y., not Purchase. A recent letter from a reader pointed out the error.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's church, children and grandchildren today celebrated the enduring Catholic faith of the founding mother of a political dynasty at funeral services in the church where she was baptized 104 years ago.         Her last living son, Edward M. Kennedy, eulogized the mother of a President, two Senators and an Ambassador and the grandmother of two United States Representatives and the Lieutenant Governor and a state representative in Maryland, saying, "She was ambitious not only for our success, but for our souls."         "She sustained us in the saddest times -- by her faith in God, which was the greatest gift she gave us -- and by the strength of her character, which was a combination of the sweetest gentleness and the most tempered steel," he said.         Bernard Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston, celebrated the Mass of Resurrection at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church and said, "Surely, as she herself expressed it, her greatest gift was the gift of faith."         "She treasured it beyond all others," he continued, "and we honor that gift in her as we bring her here to this church."         The Cardinal read a letter of condolence from President Clinton and an apostolic blessing from Pope John Paul II, and called Mrs. Kennedy "a woman of great strength and deep faith, who is unequaled in the way her life was at the service of the commonweal."         "Few lives," he said, "have been so intertwined with the joys and sorrows of our nation's life as have hers."         Mrs. Kennedy, whose sons John and Robert were assassinated, whose son Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in a wartime plane explosion, and whose daughter Kathleen was killed in a plane crash, was quoted by her grandson Edward M. Kennedy Jr. as saying in her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974):         "The most important element in human life is faith. If God were to take away all His blessings, health, physical fitness, wealth, intelligence and leave me with but one gift, I would ask for faith -- for with faith in Him and His Goodness, mercy and love for me, and belief in everlasting life, I believe I could suffer the loss of my other gifts and still be happy."         Along with personal friends of Mrs. Kennedy and her children, the congregation of more than 700 included Tipper Gore, the wife of the Vice President, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston and Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, all Democrats. The two most prominent Republicans were Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who has preceded Senator Kennedy in one Senate chairmanship and followed him in another, and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.         One absentee who was frequently recalled was Mrs. Kennedy's oldest living daughter, Rosemary, who resides in an institution for the mentally retarded in Wisconsin. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the next oldest, said, "Mother's intelligence was always informed and directed by the strength and compassion of the heart," exemplified when "she never forgot or let us ignore the company of our sister, Rosemary." Mrs. Shriver told of Rosemary's going with her on her first trip to Europe and of their forging a friendship that became the basis of her work for the disabled and the mentally retarded.         The grandmother's determined jaw was recognizable on many of the dozens of descendants who attended. The service was occasionally punctuated by cries from the youngest of her great-grandchildren who were here.         Mrs. Kennedy's 104 years amounted to just more than half the history of the Republic, and Senator Kennedy said she "was born in 1890, the year of the Battle of Wounded Knee, when Benjamin Harrison was in the White House."         "And she never let us forget that she had lived so much of the history that we only read about," he said.         Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald was baptized in St. Stephen's Church on July 23, 1890, just a day after her birth. She graduated from Dorchester High School and received her diploma in 1906 from her father the Mayor, John F. Fitzgerald, who was known as Honey Fitz. She was courted and wed in 1914 by an ambitious banker, Joseph P. Kennedy.         Both Senator Kennedy and Mrs. Shriver called their mother "our greatest teacher." Mrs. Shriver told of geography quizzes and bedtime stories, and said, "She taught us to listen to Dad's dinner table conversations about politics, which seemed too boring to a small child but later became the basis for our life's work."         This morning Massachusetts drivers stopped in the cold at highway overpasses to watch the motorcade bring her body from her home at Hyannis Port. This afternoon, after the church service, she was buried next to her husband, who died in 1969, in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.       
         Hilda Cole Espy, an author who wrote about her adventures in rearing five children after an early career as a publicity agent for Kate Smith and Fred Waring, died on Friday at the Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pa. She was 83 and lived in Delaware Water Gap, Pa.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter Freddy Espy Plimpton.         Before her marriage to the writer Willard R. Espy in 1940, Mrs. Espy was a publicity agent and an editor of Woman's Day, in addition to writing for several magazines.         The books she wrote about her family were "Quiet Yelled Mrs. Rabbit" (1959) and "Look Both Ways" (1962). She also wrote, with Lex Creamer Jr., the travel book "Another World: Central America" (1970).         Her marriage to Mr. Espy ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Plimpton, of Sagaponack, L.I., she is survived by three other daughters, Joanna, of Manhattan, Mona Espy Schreiber of New Orleans and Cassin Espy-Speziali of Staten Island, six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said.         Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.         She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.         Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."         When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.         The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."         Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."         Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.         In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.         Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.         Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.         Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Suzanne Storrs Pincus, a community volunteer active in social services and the arts, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 60.         She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Pincus was a director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a board member and past president of the Auxiliary of Montefiore Medical Center and a founder of the Professional Committee of Elem-Youth in Distress in Israel.         She was a director of Women in Need, a nonprofit organization that seeks to keep homeless women and their children together, and a founder of its summer camp, Camp WIN. She also was a founder of the nonprofit Bronx Community Enterprises, a Montefiore spinoff to encourage local businesses.         She was born Suzanne Storrs Poulton in Provo, Utah, and studied speech and communication at the University of Utah.         She turned to community work 27 years ago, helping to develop methods of improving child care and encouraging self-help among the disadvantaged.         Mrs. Pincus was on the boards of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., and the American Place Theater in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband, Lionel I. Pincus, chairman of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, a venture banking firm; two sons, Henry A. and Matthew S., both of Manhattan; and three brothers, Brent Poulton, of Medford, Ore., Kent Poulton, of San Francisco, and Michael Poulton, of Lausanne, Switzerland.       
         Nina Tikanova, a ballet teacher who had danced in the companies of Bronislava Nijinska, Ida Rubinstein and Boris Romanov, died on Wednesday at her home in Paris. She was 84.         Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Miss Tikanova trained in France with the great Russian teachers Olga Preobrazhenska and Nicolas Legat. George Balanchine invited her to join his first company, Les Ballets 1933, but she chose to join the Ballets Russes de Nijinska in Paris, where she became a leading dancer.         Miss Tikanova made her debut at 15 with the Theatre Romantique Russe, founded in Berlin by the Russian experimental choreographer Romanov. In 1928, she joined Rubinstein's avant-garde troupe, for which Nijinska was the main choreographer. She was also a principal dancer with the Nouveaux Ballets de Monte Carlo from 1942 to 1944.         After World War II, she taught dance at orphanages for children whose parents had been killed by the Nazis and directed her own ballet school in Paris.         Miss Tikanova belonged to a literary and artistic family, which she wrote about in her memoir, "The Girl in Blue," published in 1991 in France and Russia.       
         Laura Scott Taylor, the co-founder and retired principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, died on Sunday at Kings County Hospital Center. Mrs. Taylor, who lived in Crown Heights, was 79.         Mrs. Taylor was fatally injured when she was hit by a truck last Friday while crossing a street in Crown Heights.         For 32 years, Mrs. Taylor served as the unsalaried principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School, which she established in 1960 with her husband, the Rev. Gardner Taylor, now pastor emeritus of the Concord Baptist Church of Christ.         Dr. Taylor, who had been a member of the New York City Board of Education, said the school was founded because many parents felt their children were being "intellectually butchered" by the public school system. "The kids were finished before their lives had started," he said.         The school emphasizes reading and extensive instruction in black history and culture. "It means a great deal to know Negroes are making a success in every phase of life," Mrs. Taylor said in 1967. "For these children to get a good opinion of themselves is very important. They should know that those who want to make it can."         Begun with 25 pupils in grades one through six, the school reached an enrollment of 130 pupils in seven years.         "We have proved that Negroes can learn to do what anybody else can do," Mrs. Taylor said then. "There is something radically wrong with the public school system if our kids can't read."         Today, the school has an enrollment of 150 in its six grades.         Mrs. Taylor, who was born in Cleveland, grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and graduated in 1937 from Oberlin College. In 1940, after teaching in South Carolina, she married Dr. Taylor, whom she had met at the Mount Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin while he was a student at the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology.         The Taylors moved to New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La., and came to Brooklyn in 1948, when Dr. Taylor was named pastor of the Concord Baptist Church. He retired in 1990 as the dean of black pastors in the United States. In 1952, when the church was destroyed by fire, Mrs. Taylor led its women in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the construction of a replacement.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Taylor is survived by her daughter, Martha LaCroix; a brother, Eugene Scott; a sister, Elizabeth Taylor; a sister by adoption, Ruby Harris, and a grandson.       
         Cecil H. Roy, who supplied the voices for innumerable radio and animated film characters, died on Jan. 26 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 94 and lived at the Actors' Extended Care Facility in Englewood.         Ms. Roy was born in St. Paul and reared in Oklahoma. She began her acting career with a stock company in Chicago, but soon turned to radio work, where her vocal versatility quickly made her known as "The Girl of a Thousand Voices." Able to imitate anyone from a crying baby to a cranky octogenarian, she frequently performed more than a score of character roles during a single hourlong radio program.         Later in her career, she was the voice behind a number of animated film characters, among them Little Lulu and Caspar the Friendly Ghost. She also made recordings for children, including a portrayal of Winnie the Pooh on a recording with Jimmy Stewart. Among her many radio credits were "Ma Perkins," "The Rise of the Goldbergs," "The Henry Aldrich Show" and "Pepper Young's Family."         She is survived by a son, Richard, of Montclair, N.J.; four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Janina Domanska, an author and illustrator of children's books, died on Feb. 2 at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 82 and lived in New Fairfield, Conn.         She had suffered a stroke recently, said her stepson Robert Nossen.         Ms. Domanska was born in Warsaw and studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. She came to the United States in 1952 and worked in New York City as a textile designer and freelance artist before turning to creating picture books for children.         She wrote, adapted or translated 22 books, each accompanied by her own illustrations, which frequently evoked Polish folk art and drew upon folk tales from her childhood. She also illustrated 23 books by other authors. Among her best-known books are "If All the Seas Were One" (1971), "King Krakus and the Dragon" (1979), "Busy Monday Morning" (1985) and "A Was an Angler" (1991).         In addition to her stepson Robert, of Naples, she is survived by her husband, Ernest Nossen; another stepson, Edward Nossen of Cherry Hill, N.J., and five stepgrandchildren.       
         Dr. Mary Dwight B. McNair Scott, a biochemistry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was a pioneer in the identification of the B complex of vitamins and their functions, died on Feb. 9 at the Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, where she lived. She was 87.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Thomas F. McNair Scott.         In 1935, while she was completing work at Harvard University for a doctorate in biochemistry, she became one of the first women appointed to the faculty of the Harvard Medical School as a research associate.         She married the following year and moved to England with her husband where she did research on the biochemistry of diabetes at the University College Medical School in London.         From 1943 to 1946, while on the faculty of Wellesley College, she conducted studies identifying N-methyl nicotinamide in urine which contributed to the discovery of the B complex vitamin, niacin.         After her husband completed his wartime service in England, the couple settled in Philadelphia, where she went to work for the University of Pennsylvania's Children's Hospital. From 1954 to 1965 she was in the School of Medicine's research medicine and physiology departments. In 1965 Dr. Scott moved to the School of Veterinary Medicine and retired in 1972.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Robert, of Bern, Switzerland; a daughter, Carolyn Hoehn of Heidelberg, Germany; a sister, Helen Sutton Gulick of Sacramento, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Ellen Sulzberger Straus, who was active in Call for Action and other nonprofit organizations and in the communications industry, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, R. Peter Straus.         At her death, Mrs. Straus was president of Executive Service Strategies, a management and consulting firm that she founded in 1986. She and Mr. Straus were for some years co-owners of WMCA, a Manhattan-based radio station, which they sold in 1986.         In 1963, Mrs. Straus founded Call for Action, the nation's first telephone help line, which was intended to aid individuals in solving their problems with officials, corporations and landlords. That activity, using office space at WMCA, became the prototype for similar organizations in nearly all major United States cities.         Mrs. Straus was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College in 1945. She worked as the executive secretary of the New York League of Women Voters and on the staff of the Atomic Energy Commission, becoming assistant director of public information. In 1949, she helped to manage Gov. Herbert H. Lehman's campaign for the United States Senate.         Later, based in Switzerland while Mr. Straus was an executive with the International Labor Organization, she worked as a Geneva correspondent for several upstate newspapers.         In addition to her husband of 45 years, who is chairman of Straus Communications, Mrs. Straus is survived by her mother, Louise Mayer Blumenthal Sulzberger of Longboat Key, Fla., and Saranac Lake, N.Y.; four children, Diane Tucker of Bedford, N.Y., Katherine Caple of Wellesley, Mass., Jeanne Tofel of Manhattan and Eric Straus of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; two sisters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann Sand, both of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Ida Gertrude Krebs, whose lifelong interest in children with learning disabilities led her to found a school where she could implement a highly individual approach to such problems, died on Feb. 11 at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. She was 86 and had lived in Lexington, Mass., until about three years ago.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Roy R. Krebs Jr. of Alexandria.         Born in Fort Worth, a grand-niece of President Woodrow Wilson, she first offered help to the disadvantaged when, as a teen-ager, she tutored a neighbor who had been dismissed from school because of a learning disability. In 1968, she founded the Krebs School in Lexington, Mass., where more than 100 children with learning disabilities studied in classes of no more than eight pupils.         She employed unusual techniques to capture the children's interest. The school's pet dog was brought to class so students would learn to count by monitoring the wags of its tail. Division was taught with visits to the kitchen to slice carrots.         She was a member of the President's Council on Handicapped Children for more than 20 years and worked as a consultant to Governments in Canada, Colombia and Venezuela.         Trained as a nurse, she counseled veterans returning from World War II who had suffered battle trauma. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education from Boston University, she tutored extensively in Cambridge, Mass., and then in Arlington, Mass., before establishing her own school.         Upon her retirement in 1986, the Krebs School was merged into the Cotting School, which offered a more comprehensive curriculum.         Her husband, Roy R. Krebs, died in the mid-1940's. In addition to her son, Roy Jr., she is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Quinlan of San Clemente, Calif., and Dr. Ruth Briles of Sycamore, Ill.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Joan R. Cook, a former reporter and union leader at The New York Times who was a principal organizer of a successful 1974 sex-discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper, died Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her daughter, Jezebel, of Manhattan.         Ms. Cook was a reporter in metropolitan news when she retired from The Times in 1991.         In 1974, when women at The Times filed a class-action suit accusing it of discrimination, she was one of seven named plaintiffs. The case was settled in 1978 with cash payments and an affirmative-action plan.         She was elected head of the New York Newspaper Guild's Times unit in 1980, the first woman in the post.         Ms. Cook was born in Portland, Ore., and attended the University of California at Los Angeles. In 1940, she joined The Minneapolis Star-Journal and Tribune, working in classified advertising. In 1949, she moved to Paris, where she wrote a column for the Paris edition of The Herald Tribune. She joined The Times in Family/Style in 1959 and transferred to metropolitan news in 1972 as a New Jersey correspondent.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two other children, John Barlow of Winchester, England, and Joseph Cook of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Catherine, of Pearl River, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  February 18, 1995, Saturday         An obituary on Feb. 6 about Joan R. Cook, a former reporter and Newspaper Guild leader at The New York Times, referred incorrectly to women's history in the union leadership at The Times. Ms. Cook, who was elected in 1980 to head the guild's Times unit, was not the first woman to do so. The first was Jerre Smoot, in the 1940's.       
         Elizabeth Dorothy Futas, the director of the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, died on Feb. 6 in Philadelphia. She was 50 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.         The cause has not been reported, according to the American Library Association in Chicago. Dr. Futas, a member of its governing council, was attending the association's midwinter meeting at the Pennsylvania Convention Center at the time.         Dr. Futas took up her duties at the university in Kingston, R.I., in 1986 and during the next decade helped to train a generation of reference and children's book librarians. She also revamped the programs of the library school and within two years helped it to secure accreditation.         She worked as a cataloguer for the Ford Foundation in New York and as a reference librarian at Queens College in the 1960's and 1970's. Before accepting the job at Rhode Island, she held faculty positions at Rutgers University, Emory University and the University of Washington in Seattle, among other institutions.         She was the author of four books on library science, including "Library Acquisition Policies and Procedures" (Oryx Press; 3d edition, 1994), and "The Library Forms Illustrated Handbook" (Neal-Schuman, 1984).         Born in Brooklyn, Dr. Futas was a political science graduate of Brooklyn College. She received a master's in librarian science at the University of Minnesota and a doctorate in information studies at Rutgers.         She is survived by her mother, Eleanor Futas of Manhattan, and a sister, Susan Wagner of Bethesda, Md.       
         Myra Pollack Sadker, a Washington educator and writer who charted sexual bias in the nation's classrooms, died on Saturday at Georgetown Medical Center. She was 52 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was complications from a bone marrow transplant for breast cancer, said a spokesman for American University, where she was a professor and former dean of the school of education.         Dr. Sadker's most recent work was "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" (Scribners, 1994). It was written in collaboration with her husband, David M. Sadker, a fellow professor at American's school of education. The couple had first studied the subject of sexual bias when they were graduate students together.         With a decade's worth of research, "Failing at Fairness" sought to document that girls' educations were inferior to those of boys. The reason, the authors concluded, was the conscious or subconscious sexism of teachers who spend more time interacting with boys.         Teachers, according to the book, call on boys more, make more substantive comments on their work, and praise and goad them more. The result is that over time girls tend to lose self-esteem and do more poorly in standardized tests.         Dr. Sadker's research was widely reported in newspapers and magazines around the country. It also led to many invitations for her to appear on national television and radio programs.         Myra Pollack Sadker was born in Portland, Me., and graduated from Boston University. She received a master's degree at Harvard University and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. She taught at junior and senior high schools in Massachusetts and Thailand before joining the faculty of American University in 1973.         In graduate school, the Sadkers noticed that there seemed to be subtle differences in the education they received in the same classrooms and studying the same books. The experience started them in their career as a husband-and-wife team examining sexual bias in schools through research based on transcripts of classroom interactions, textbooks, surveys and polls.         Dr. Sadker was the author or co-author of six books and scores of articles on sexism, teacher education and children's books. Her work was recognized this year with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the American Association of University Women.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Sadker is survived by two daughters, Robin and Jacqueline; a brother, Dr. Murray Pollack of Potomac, Md., and her father, Louis Pollack of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Jean Davis, a philanthropist and the mother of Marvin Davis, the billionaire financier and former owner of 20th Century Fox, died on Feb. 21 at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 94 and had lived most of her life in Manhattan.         The cause was respiratory failure, said a spokesman for the family.         In her later years, Mrs. Davis worked closely with her daughter-in-law, Barbara Davis, to raise money for the Children's Diabetes Foundation in Denver and for multiple sclerosis research. She was also active in raising money for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society and the United Jewish Appeal.         Besides her son, Marvin, she is survived by 14 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  March 10, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Wednesday about Jean Davis, a philanthropist and the mother of the financier Marvin Davis, omitted a surviving daughter. She is Joan Davis Chorney of Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Yvette Hawkins, a stage, film and television actress, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 54.         The cause was lung cancer, the hospital said.         Ms. Hawkins appeared on Broadway in "The Amen Corner," "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death" and "Checkmates." Her Off Broadway credits included "The Strong Breed," "The Trials of Brother Jero," "The Resurrection of Lady Lester," "The Last Street Play" and "Before It Hits Home."         She also acted in regional theater, appearing in productions by the Philadelphia Drama Guild, the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the Intiman Theater in Seattle.         Her films include "Nighthawks," "Lean on Me," "Mississippi Masala" and "Zebrahead." Television viewers saw her in "As the World Turns," "Cagney and Lacey," "Guiding Light" and "Law and Order.         Ms. Hawkins also was a co-writer of "A Guide to the Black Apple" and a writer for the Children's Television Workshop.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Mary Bingham, the matriarch of the Bingham newspaper empire, died suddenly in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday evening. She was 90 and lived in Glenview, 15 minutes outside Louisville, on the family estate.         Mrs. Bingham, a philanthropist and civic leader and the widow of Barry Bingham Sr., was delivering a speech at a dinner in her honor when she collapsed. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Norton Hospital.         At the dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel to raise money for the de Paul School in Louisville, Mrs. Bingham had been toasted by Gov. Brereton Jones; Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville; other Kentucky dignitaries, and her daughter Eleanor Bingham Miller.         Before delivering her prepared speech, Mrs. Bingham said she was so flattered by the event that "the best thing would be for a big pink cloud to come down and take me away." She then spoke about the need for civic responsibility and asked for support of the Louisville Free Public Library.         In the part of her talk that remained undelivered, she quoted Pericles as saying that an Athenian "who did not acquaint himself with and took no part in public affairs was regarded not as unambitious, but as a man of no consequence whatever."         All her life, she was a most enthusiastic participant in public and cultural affairs. Governor Jones said that with Mrs. Bingham's death, "Kentucky has lost one of its most caring and productive citizens."         A distinguished, articulate woman, Mrs. Bingham was for more than 60 years a major presence on the Louisville scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bingham, always known as "the Binghams," were great hosts, especially at Kentucky Derby time, when their invitations were among the most coveted.         Together with Mr. Bingham, who died in 1988, Mrs. Bingham was a generous supporter of the arts and of educational and social programs. She was a strong environmentalist and also led a drive to send book mobiles to rural Kentucky.         After her husband died, she took over as the head of the family foundation, the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, which gave $59 million to a wide variety of institutions. Last fall, the Actors Theater of Louisville opened the Bingham Theater. The beneficence of the Binghams is one reason Louisville is such a prosperous cultural community.         In 1986, a bitter family conflict engulfed the Binghams, leading to the sale of their media empire, the cornerstone of which was The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper known for its liberal politics and socially conscious positions. Barry Bingham Sr. had been publisher of the newspaper after his father, Robert Bingham, and, in turn, he had been succeeded by his son Barry Bingham Jr.         After Barry Bingham Jr. and his sisters, Eleanor and Sallie Bingham, were locked in a feud over control of the company, Barry Bingham Sr. decided to sell. The battle and the sale of the paper to the Gannett chain became front-page news throughout the country. Later, several books were written about the conflict and the family itself, including a memoir by Sallie that was critical of her parents.         Behind the scenes, Mrs. Bingham had been a force at the newspaper. She was a vice president and director and wrote editorials while her husband was overseas during World War II. For 26 years, until 1968, she was the editor of the book review section.         Mrs. Bingham was born Mary Caperton on Dec. 24, 1904, in Richmond, and as a young woman, she acted with Richmond's Little Theater. It was while she was a classics major at Radcliffe College that she met her husband, then a student at Harvard University. They were both involved in collegiate dramatics.         After graduating from Radcliffe in 1928, she spent a year studying in Greece on a fellowship. In 1931, she and Barry Bingham were married. They had five children, including two sons, Worth and Jonathan, who died in accidents.         The Binghams were active in Democratic politics and would, as Mrs. Bingham said, "get together with liberal friends on election night to listen to the results in sympathetic company."         When her son became publisher of the paper, he exchanged houses with his parents, as was the family tradition. The parents moved into the so-called Little House on the family estate, an Italianate villa where Mrs. Bingham continued to live after her husband's death.         In addition to her son and daughters, Mrs. Bingham is survived by six grandsons, four granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.       
         Holly Harp, the California designer who went from a Sunset Boulevard sensation to a darling of Fifth Avenue salons, died on Monday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 55.         The cause of death was cancer, said her fiance, Mark Buchman.         Mrs. Harp, who captivated Hollywood with a rich hippie look in the 1960's and enthralled New York with soft clinging designs, was nominated for Coty awards two times.         But Mr. Buchman said on Friday in reporting her death that Mrs. Harp once described herself as a "counterculturalist," an apt description for a woman who began her career translating the clothes of the flower children into fashion for counterculture heroines.         When rock stars like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick began exchanging jeans for Mrs. Harp's fringed vests and tie-dyed velvet dresses, the Holly's Harp shop that she opened on Sunset Boulevard in 1968 became the center of a new style.         Her husband at the time, Jim, described the fashions, which included painted jersey, silk and chiffon dresses, and hip-hugger bell bottoms made from old draperies, as "somewhere between here and Mars."         Mrs. Harp came down to earth a bit after 1973, when she began selling to Fifth Avenue stores like Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman, whose fourth-floor Holly Harp shop showed her latest collection of $1,500 evening dresses three weeks ago.         But for all their initial counterculture flamboyance, the designs from the beginning included soft flowing chiffon dresses. Mrs. Harp had a disarming explanation for how she achieved that soft romantic look. "I took the construction out," she said.         For all the comparative elegance of her sensuous body-hugging evening dresses, Mrs. Harp's designs always had an edge, sometimes literally. In 1977, when one bright red creation reminded her of a flame, she proceeded to enhance the effect, taking a blowtorch and charring the garment's edges.         "I'm not trying to do tasteful little uniforms," she said in 1988. "Being dressed in perfect taste is very aging."         Mrs. Harp, a size 6 who designed for her own 5-foot-4-inch frame, had no patience for the presumed restrictions of age. As she put it when she appeared at an interview at the age of 47 wearing a short lame dress with glitter hose: "I still have a sexy little girl in me that won't quit."         Mrs. Harp was born in Buffalo and studied design at North Texas State University, where she met and married Mr. Harp, an English instructor. Her boutique became such a success that he abandoned his academic career. They divorced in 1980, but remained business partners.         Surviving are a son, Tom, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Sarah Bozzola of Orange, Conn., and Elizabeth Horn of Buffalo, and a brother, Thomas Speller of Buffalo.       
         Bonnie Bird, a Martha Graham dancer in the 1930's and an internationally known teacher, died on Sunday at her home in Tiburon, Calif. She was 80.         The cause was cancer said Marion North, a friend and colleague.         Miss Bird was born in Portland, Ore., and was educated at the Cornish School of Fine Arts in Seattle, where she studied with Graham, who invited her to join her company in New York. She performed from 1933 to 1937, appearing in works that included "Celebration," "American Provincial," "Panorama" and "Chronicle."         Miss Bird was best known, however, as an imaginative, practical teacher of dance who believed strongly that dancers must not only be trained in their craft but must also be aware of and a part of the world around them. In 1937, she became head of the dance department at the Cornish School. Her students there included Merce Cunningham and Remy Charlip, and her accompanists were the composers John Cage and Lou Harrison.         In 1935, she was a member of the first dance faculty at the 92d Street Y, a center for modern dance in New York City. She also taught there from 1951 to 1963, establishing a program for children and children's dance teachers that became the Merry-Go-Rounders, a highly successful company that presented dance for children.         Miss Bird played an important part in the founding and development of the American Dance Guild and the Congress on Research in Dance. In 1974, she began a long association with the Laban Center for Movement and Dance in London.         Miss Bird's husband, Ralph Gundlach, died in 1978.         She is surived by two brothers, Scott, of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Bill, of Rossmore, Calif.; a daughter, Heidi Gundlach Smith of Willets, Calif.; two sons, John Scott Gundlach of Helen, Ga., and Michael Gundlach of Cordova, Alaska, and a grandaughter. A memorial tribute is to be held on April 30 at 6 P.M. at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue.
