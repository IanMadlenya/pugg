         Maxine Postal, the Suffolk County legislative leader who resigned her post this week because of failing health, died Thursday in a hospice in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where she also had a home. She was 61 and lived in Amityville, N.Y.         In announcing her resignation, which took effect a day before her death, Ms. Postal cited her recent diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rapidly spreading brain disorder. Her death was reported yesterday by her press secretary, Kara Hahn.         One of the highest-ranking elected officials in the county, Ms. Postal was first voted into the county Legislature 15 years ago. A Democrat, she championed equal rights for women, environmental protection, and programs for children, the elderly and the poor.         She was chosen as presiding officer for a one-year term last year by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. As such she was in a position to shape the legislative agenda, name committee chairmen and preside at meetings of the 18-member body.         As her illness progressed in recent months, her duties often fell upon the deputy presiding officer elected alongside her, Joseph Caracappa, a Republican from Selden. The Republican caucus designated him last month to succeed her as presiding officer.         Born Maxine Levy in Brooklyn on Nov. 24, 1942, Ms. Postal was a 1962 fine-arts graduate of Brooklyn College, where she also received an M.A. in fine arts in 1965. She taught at public junior high and high schools in Brooklyn for six years before opening the Busy Bee Nursery School and Kindergarten there in 1968.         After moving to Long Island, she owned and directed the Busy Bee nursery in Amityville from 1976 to 1990, when the press of her community work and public service prompted her to sell the business.         She served as president of the Hauppauge Library Board in the 1970's and was a vice president of the Amityville Board of Education from 1984 to 1988.         In 1987 she was elected to the County Legislature. She served as minority leader and headed the Health Services Committee, the Human Services Committee and the Senior Citizens Committee.         In 2002 she was the vice chairwoman of the Finance and Fiscal Services Committee.         Ms. Postal is survived by two sons, Army Lt. Gregory J. Postal of Silver Spring, Md., and Dr. Eric S. Postal of Albany; a sister, Deborah Gitelman of Orangeburg, N.Y.; and her companion, Elie Mystal of Amityville. Her marriage to Jeffrey L. Postal ended in divorce.       
         Joan Cullman, a Tony Award-winning producer on Broadway, died yesterday at her winter home in Tryall, Jamaica. She was 72 and also had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Tracy Straus.         Ms. Cullman was a producer of at least nine Broadway shows, including Yasmina Reza's ''Art,'' which won the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play in 1998.         She was also a producer of several Tony-nominated plays and musicals, including David Hare's ''Skylight'' in 1996, ''Sweet Smell of Success'' in 2002 and ''The Play What I Wrote'' last year.         Her other Broadway shows include ''The Rink,'' a musical written by Terrence McNally with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb; Mr. Hare's ''Judas Kiss,'' and ''Carmelina.''         Ms. Cullman was a vice chairwoman of the board of the Lincoln Center Theater and had served on the board there since 1985. At Lincoln Center she was the chairwoman of the patrons' committee and founded the Joan Cullman Award for Extraordinary Creativity, a cash prize that has been given to Tom Stoppard, Stockard Channing, Julie Taymor, Spalding Gray and others.         Born Joan Paley in Far Rockaway, Queens, she graduated from Brooklyn College and began her career as an assistant to Stan Lee, the creator of ''Spider-Man'' and other comic books.         Her marriage to Barnard Sachs Straus ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter, she is survived by her husband Joseph F. Cullman III of Manhattan, the chairman emeritus of the Philip Morris Companies in New York; a son, Barney Straus Jr., of Evanston, Ill.; a brother, Leon Paley of Far Rockaway; and a grandson.       
         Mary B. Goodhue, a longtime New York State senator who lost her seat in 1992 in a rare Republican primary to a little-known assemblyman by the name of George E. Pataki, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital, her son, Francis A. Goodhue III, said. She was 82 and lived in Bedford, N.Y.         Mrs. Goodhue had represented northern Westchester and Putnam Counties in the State Legislature for 18 years, first in the Assembly and for seven terms in the Senate, when she was challenged in a Republican primary by Mr. Pataki, a protégé of hers who had once worked on her Senate staff as legislative counsel.         It was the year women running for political office across the nation had named ''the year of the woman,'' and Mrs. Goodhue, who was 71, was the only woman in the State Senate's Republican majority. That spring she had announced she would retire; a few days later, at the urging of party leaders, she changed her mind.         But Mr. Pataki, then 47, decided to challenge her anyway. It was a rare spectacle in state politics: a bitter primary in a party that usually avoids public squabbles. Mr. Pataki campaigned from the right, casting his former boss as too liberal.         Mrs. Goodhue told voters that year that Mr. Pataki was ''a very nice fellow; the only thing is, how come he wants my seat?'' In his autobiography, Mr. Pataki recalled the race as ''an arduous primary battle against an enormously popular incumbent.'' He won narrowly, and the statewide attention that the race drew helped set him on his path to the governorship.         Governor Pataki issued a statement yesterday expressing his condolences to Mrs. Goodhue's family and announcing that he had ordered the flags at the State Capitol in Albany and elsewhere to be flown at half-staff in her honor. ''Mary Goodhue was a dedicated public servant who had a long and distinguished career and contributed much to the greatness of our state, and particularly to Westchester and the Hudson Valley region,'' he said.         Mrs. Goodhue, who was born in London in 1921, became an American citizen as a child. She graduated from Vassar College and earned her law degree from the University of Michigan. As a lawyer, she worked for several firms and at the New York State Crime Commission from 1951 to 1953. She founded her own firm -- Goodhue, Arons & Neary, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y. -- and worked there until 2002.         In the Senate, Mrs. Goodhue, the chairwoman of the committee on child care, investigated violations at day care centers, delved into minutia of the state's complex school financing formulas, and introduced legislation regulating surrogate mothers.         Mrs. Goodhue was married for 42 years to Francis A. Goodhue Jr., who died in 1990. She is survived by her son, of Bedford, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  April 3, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of former New York State Senator Mary B. Goodhue on March 26 misstated the name of the her law firm at its founding; it was Goodhue & Lange. (It later became Goodhue, Arons & Neary; it is now Arons & Neary.)       
         Estée Lauder, the last great independent titan of the cosmetics industry, who convinced generations of women that her beauty creams were ''jars of hope'' in their quest for the eternal look of youth, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her family, in announcing her death, said she was 97.         ''The pursuit of beauty is honorable,'' Mrs. Lauder used to say. And she clearly believed that the business of beauty was just as honorable. No one but a believer could have given so much of herself in becoming an internationally respected strategist in the age-old struggle against wrinkles, sags, bags and blemishes. Her weapons in that effort were creams, powders, ointments, potions and muds, many containing top-secret emollients. And if they didn't do the trick, she had an array of scents, equally secret in their constitution, that might befog man's vision of woman aging.         Her efforts resulted in the establishment of a company estimated to be worth about $5 billion when it went public in 1995 and she was given the title of founding chairwoman. In 2003, it had 21,500 employees and an estimated worth of about $10 billion. Its products are sold in more than 130 countries across five continents.         Estée Lauder Companies was not formally established until 1946 but its roots go back to the 1920's with facial creams concocted over a gas stove in a modest kitchen by Mrs. Lauder's uncle, John Schotz. It was nurtured financially and technically years later by Arnold L. van Ameringen, a Dutch-born industrialist. The company grew exponentially in the 1950's with the introduction of a bath oil called Youth-Dew, the creation of which is variously attributed to Mrs. Lauder and Mr. van Ameringen.         In the years after the start of her almost messianic crusade to give women the perennial bloom of youth, Mrs. Lauder marketed a variety of other beauty aids, among them Super-Rich All Purpose Creme, Cleaning Oil, Creme Pack and a skin lotion (all of them the creations of Dr. Schotz). In all, she marketed some 2,000 individual shades and items produced by five Lauder companies: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Prescriptives and (for men) Aramis. Among the fragrances she introduced were Estée (1968), Azuree (1969), Aliage (1972), Private Collection (1973), Beautiful (1985) and Pleasures (1995).         In 1995 the company also entered into a licensing agreement with the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to market Tommy, a line of fragrances, and with Make-Up Artists Cosmetics of Toronto to distribute its MAC products outside North America.         ''I love my product,'' Mrs. Lauder once said. ''I love to touch the creams, smell them, look at them, carry them with me. A person has to love her harvest if she's to expect others to love it.''         Mrs. Lauder also loved to touch her customers. During the period when she was building her business, she invariably showed up at stores where her products were being introduced and, with no provocation at all, whip out a jar and rub its contents on the wrist or face of a prospective customer so that her skin would acquire ''a gentle glow.''         She also understood the rewards that come from generosity and she was known in the industry for her free samples and particularly for the concept of ''gift with purchase.'' She introduced these creative marketing measures when her company was in its infancy and she was advised by an agency that the $50,000 she had available for advertising was not enough to have any effect.         Although she was protective toward those who trusted her to create effective products, she used stark candor to describe her competitors, all of them ferocious and all of whom she outlived by many years. She referred to Charles Revson as ''my arch and implacable enemy'' and she said that Elizabeth Arden was ''not a nice woman, not a generous woman.'' She said that Sam Rubin of Fabergé was ''patronizing even for those prefeminist days'' and that although Helena Rubenstein may have looked like a czarina, ''the skin on her neck was less than perfect.''         Perfection in the face of woman consumed Mrs. Lauder, and so did her desire to make a lot of money and leave the conditions of her childhood behind her. ''Someday, I will have whatever I want,'' she is said to have predicted many years ago. By the late 1980's, with personal assets of $233 million and a listing in Forbes's gallery of the 400 richest Americans, it was clear that she had made her prediction come true.         Although the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry led many women to believe that Estée Lauder was born in Europe to an aristocratic family, she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all. Josephine Esther Mentzer was born at home in Corona, Queens, on July 1, 1908, according to several biographies, although her family believes it may have been two years earlier. She was the daughter of Max Mentzer, a hardware man who was the proprietor of a hay and seed store, and Rose Schotz Rosenthal Mentzer, a woman who was much interested in beauty regimens.         The Mentzers were hard-working immigrants and Esther, destined to become known to the world by the diminutive of Estée, recalled well the Christmastime wrapping of gifts of hammers and nails, her father's gifts to his customers.         In her 1985 autobiography, ''Estée, A Success Story,'' Mrs. Lauder recalled her mother as ''a Hungarian beauty whose mother was a French Catholic and whose father was a Hungarian Jew.'' She described her father as ''an elegant, dapper monarchist in Europe, who, when transported to a new country, still carried a cane and gloves on Sundays.''         In interviews conducted over the years with various journalists, Mrs. Lauder said much that indicated her beginnings were quite genteel and comfortable. But Lee Israel, whose unauthorized biography, ''Estée Lauder, Beyond the Magic,'' was also published in 1985, maintained that the Lauder family's life in a working-class Italian neighborhood was much more modest than Mrs. Lauder would acknowledge.         Whatever her circumstances, there was no quarrel about the suggestion that as a young girl, Estée, a petite blonde, was known for her lovely skin and her determination to always look good. This determination was heightened when, as a student at Newtown High School in Queens, she became interested in the work of her uncle, John Schotz.         He had come to the United States from Hungary in 1900 with considerable training in chemistry. People referred to him as Dr. Schotz, although it is not clear that he had a doctorate. Whatever his background, he created a number of beauty products, including Six-in-One Cold Cream, Dr. Schotz Viennese Cream and a number of fragrances.         But the New Way Laboratory, which he created in 1924, was hardly limited to the needs of the beautiful people. It also produced a poultry-lice killer, a cure for mange, suppositories, a cream that was touted as promoting the building of muscles, a freckle remover and even embalming fluid. Years later, a chemist for Revlon said that although Dr. Schotz's beauty-care products were heavy and ''very old fashioned,'' they were good for their time and effective, especially for dry skin. One of the Schotz products even contained a primitive form of sunscreen.         Estée studied his homemade products closely and, since Dr. Schotz was no businessman, helped him to sell them. Estée said little about her past and it is not clear that she even graduated from Newtown High. But in school or out, she remained fascinated with his beauty aids and was still promoting them in 1930 when she married Joseph Lauter, whom she had been dating for about three years. He was the son of William and Lillian Lauter, who had come to the United States from the part of Austria known as Galicia. Mr. Lauter had tried his hand without much success in both the silk and button businesses. The name was changed to ''Lauder'' later in the decade.         Their marriage foundered and they were divorced in 1939. Their separation lasted until 1942, when Estée told her friends that Mr. Lauder was a very nice man and that ''I don't know why I broke off with him.'' They remarried that December and remained together until his death in 1982.         She is survived by her sons, Leonard A., the chairman of the company, and Ronald S., chairman of Clinique Laboratories; four grandchildren, including William, who will become chief executive of the Estée Lauder Companies on July 1; and six great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Lauder and her husband were apart she met and became close to Mr. van Ameringen, who became president and chairman of International Flavors and Fragrances, a company that formulates fragrances for many well-known beauty houses and has no connection with the Lauder empire. They became lifelong friends and Mr. van Ameringen provided both credit and, some said, product formula for the firm that would bear Mrs. Lauder's name. From the beginning, she was its chief executive and made its most important marketing and product development decisions.         In 1944, the Lauders opened concessions in beauty salons in New York and sold products to out-of-town salons through jobbers. Leonard Lauder, who became president of the company in the 1970's, recalled that ''we had a Boston wholesaler, the Samuel Bernstein Hair Company, and Mr. Bernstein used to talk to me about his son Lenny.''         Mrs. Lauder would go on the road, trying to induce finer stores to feature her merchandise. ''I have the secrets,'' she would tell prospective clients. ''Start the New Year with a new face.''         The concessions were closed in 1946 and gradually the company sold to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. That helped to give her products the prestigious aura they needed for more aggressive marketing.         The introduction of Youth-Dew and Mrs. Lauder's sales expertise combined to take the company from a sales volume of no more than $400 a week to around $5,000 in the early 1950's. It still had no sales staff as such, but it was gaining an image of quality from the department stores in which it was displayed. By 1958, when Leonard joined the company, sales had soared to about $800,000 a year.         The company began to grow more rapidly. In 1965, Mrs. Lauder opened her first beauty ''spa'' in Bloomingdale's New York store. She planned her counters personally and determined that each ''would be a tiny, shining spa -- complete.''         ''I'd make sure the color I chose was the same wonderful 'in between a blue and a green' that whispered elegance, aristocracy, and also complemented bathroom wallpapers,'' she said.         By this time, Estée Lauder was well on her way to becoming the doyenne of beauty and her list of friends began to reflect her regal image. The Duchess of Windsor had long been a friend and now there were others. Princess Grace of Monaco sent her Christmas cards and visited her in New York. Many socially prominent people invited her to their parties, among them the Begum Aga Khan, C. Z. Guest, Nancy Reagan and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. In January 1978, when she received the Legion of Honor, it did not seem to bother the French that Estée Lauder's fragrances were outselling Chanel's by 3 to 1. Gerard Gaussen, the consul general of France, said that she ''represents what we French admire most about Americans -- brains and heart.''         Mrs. Lauder was a generous contributor to civic causes and charities. The Lauder Foundation was set up in the 1960's and it has, among other things, set up three playgrounds in Central Park. The Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies was founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.         It was probably inevitable that such a woman would have her detractors, too. Some said Mrs. Lauder had never adequately compensated John Schotz, who died in the 1960's in modest circumstances at a time when Estée Lauder Inc. was grossing around $14 million a year. Others, according to her biographer, Lee Israel, complained that she denied or played down her Jewishness (Ms. Israel said that Mrs. Lauder told one interviewer that she was half Italian and convent-bred), that she was a name-dropper, a social climber, and not entirely loyal. Ms. Israel quotes an ex-secretary to the duchess of Windsor as complaining that after the duke died and the duchess became infirm, Mrs. Lauder ''deserted'' her.         Unperturbed by the naysayers, Mrs. Lauder lived life vigorously, taking from it what she wanted and rejecting things that would take her away from the people and places she knew. Thus, she rejected President Nixon's offer to make her ambassador to Luxembourg (she blamed her husband, who reportedly said, ''I'm not going to carry her bags'').         In 1982, she demonstrated her approach to life. When she felt that her ruby and diamond tiara clashed horribly with her turquoise dress, she immediately switched to a more suitable gold and diamond crown. ''You know how it is,'' she told Charlotte Curtis of The New York Times. ''You have to wear something.''       
         Mildred Jeffrey, who for seven decades was an influential behind-the-scenes combatant in the women's, labor and civil rights movements, died on March 24 in Detroit. She was 93.         Her death was announced by the United Automobile Workers union, where she was the first woman to head a department, becoming director of its Women's Bureau in 1944. She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus and was the unofficial head of a group of women who helped persuade Walter F. Mondale to name Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate on the 1984 Democratic ticket.         As a student at the University of Minnesota in the early 1930's, she and an African-American classmate helped integrate restaurants in Minneapolis. Decades later, she marched in the South with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.         In 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.         Mildred McWilliams, known as Millie, was born on Dec. 29, 1910, in Alton, Iowa, the eldest of seven children. Her grandmother, a widow, ran a farm and raised 16 children by herself. Her mother, who was the first woman to become a registered pharmacist in Iowa, in 1908, raised seven children on her own after her husband left the family.         In 1932, Ms. Jeffrey received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Minnesota, where she immersed herself in the socialist and progressive movements. In 1934, she received a master's degree in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr.         With the passage of laws promoting labor unions, she became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Philadelphia and later the education director of the Pennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers.         In 1936, she married another Amalgamated organizer, Homer Newman Jeffrey. They organized workers in the South and the East, taking mill jobs and rushing to unionize factories before management fired them for their activism. They divorced in the late 1950's.         During World War II, they moved to Washington and became consultants to the War Labor Board. There, they became close to Walter and Victor Reuther, the U.A.W. leaders.         In 1944, she moved to Detroit when the Reuthers offered her the job as head of the union's new Women's Bureau. She organized the U.A.W.'s first women's conference when a flood of returning veterans resulted in the large-scale postwar layoffs of women from factory jobs.         From 1949 to 1954 she ran the union's radio station. She also became director of its community relations department, aligning the union behind many civil rights efforts, and from 1968 to 1976, the year she retired, she headed the union's consumer affairs department.         Throughout her years at the union, she was active organizing, canvassing and raising money for the Democratic Party and civil rights efforts.         After helping create the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971, she became a leader on the Democratic Party committee that ensured that half the delegates to its 1980 convention were women. She helped propel the careers of many women in politics, including the governor of Michigan, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat.         Patricia Schroeder, a former United States representative from Colorado, said, ''Millie is the political godmother for many of us.''         Ms. Jeffrey ran for only one office, when she was elected in Michigan to the board of governors of Wayne State University in Detroit. She served on the board for 16 years, including three years as its chairwoman.         She played a major role in many groups, including the Coalition of Labor Union Women, Emily's List, Americans for Democratic Action, the National Abortion Rights League and the American Civil Liberties Union.         She is survived by a daughter, Sharon Lehrer of San Rafael, Calif.; a son, Balfour, of Missoula, Mont.; three sisters, Arlene Swain of St. Paul, Dorothy Shabel of St. Louis and Marjorie Lapic of Seattle; and two grandchildren.         Three years ago, Ms. Jeffrey told a University of Minnesota magazine: ''My underlying goal was always to empower women. Get them to learn their rights, and to exercise them!''       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Janet R. Whitman, former president and chairwoman of the Sheltering Arms foster care agency in New York, died on Sept. 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her son Charles S. Whitman III.         Mrs. Whitman, who was an officer or board member of several other charities and societies, belonged to a politically prominent family. Her father-in-law, Charles S. Whitman, was a governor of New York, and her daughter-in-law Christie Whitman is a former governor of New Jersey.         Mrs. Whitman was born Janet Russell on Jan. 2, 1919, in Manhattan and was a graduate of the Brearley School and Bryn Mawr College.

         Sister Nancy Salisbury, longtime headmistress of New York's oldest independent school for girls, the Convent of the Sacred Heart, died on Sept. 27 in Atherton, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was respiratory failure after a kidney infection, according to an announcement by the United States Province of the Society of the Sacred Heart, the Roman Catholic religious order she entered in 1952; according the practice of the order, she was known as Sister Salisbury.         In her 20 years as headmistress of Sacred Heart, which runs from prekindergarten to 12th grade, Sister Salisbury overhauled the school's curriculum, upgraded its facilities and nearly doubled its enrollment. In 1990, the school received a Blue Ribbon Award for Academic Excellence from the United States Department of Education.         Sister Salisbury was also vice chairwoman of the board of the New York State Association of Independent Schools and head of its accreditation commission.         Sister Salisbury was born May 15, 1930, in New York and attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Overbrook, Pa., one of several schools across the country founded by the Society of the Sacred Heart.         She received a bachelor's degree in history from Manhattanville College in 1962 and a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Detroit in 1968.         After teaching math at a Sacred Heart school in Grosse Pointe, Mich., she became head of the middle school of the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Conn. She was then headmistress for 10 years, starting in 1970.         In 1980, she became headmistress in New York. After retiring in 2000, she was a mentor to novice nuns in Chicago.         Over the years, Sister Salisbury also sat on the boards of Sacred Heart schools in Albany, Miami and Greenwich.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Sharifa Alkhateeb, an advocate for Muslim culture in the United States who helped place courses in Middle Eastern cultures and Arabic in public schools, died on Oct. 21 at her home in Ashburn, Va. She was 58.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter Nasreen.         Ms. Alkhateeb, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, spent much of her life interpreting Islam. Even as she adhered to Muslim traditions like covering her hair, she encouraged Muslim women to be active in their larger communities.         ''She was dedicated to understanding Islam for herself as opposed to Islam coming to us with all the cultural wrappings,'' said her sister Nafeesa Ahmad.         In 1992, she founded the North American Council for Muslim Women, an education and advocacy group, and was president of the Muslim Education Council, which instructed public-school teachers on Middle Eastern cultures, Islam and Muslim society.         In 2000, she created the Peaceful Families Project, which studies and raises awareness of domestic violence in Muslim communities and is financed by the Department of Justice. At the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, she was chairwoman of the Muslim caucus.         Ms. Alkhateeb wrote and lectured extensively to challenge stereotypes of Muslims, and particularly of Muslim women. She was a co-author of ''The Arab World Notebook,'' a secondary school textbook; for eight years she waged a campaign, which was successful, to make Arabic part of the language offerings in several high schools in Northern Virginia. Publishers of social studies textbooks would seek her comments, and she was an adviser to North American Muslim student groups.         Sharifa Ahmad was born on June 6, 1946, to a Yemeni father and a Czech mother. She finished high school in three years and attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which she received a bachelor's degree in English literature. She later received a master's degree in comparative religion from Norwich University, in Northfield, Vt. From 1978 to 1987 she and her husband lived in Saudi Arabia.         In the 1970's, Ms. Alkhateeb wrote for The Saudi Gazette, an English-language newspaper in Jidda, and she edited an English translation of the Koran. She was managing editor of The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences in the early 1990's.         In 1993, she created a monthly cable television program, ''Middle Eastern Parenting,'' for the Fairfax County (Va.) Public Schools.         After the Sept. 11 attacks, she became a team leader of the Community Resilience Project, a counseling center in Northern Virginia supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.         In addition to her daughter Nasreen Alkhateeb, of Brooklyn, and her sister Nafeesa Ahmad, of Oakland, Calif., Ms. Alkhateeb is survived by her husband, Mejdi; a brother, Muhammad Ahmad, of Horsham, Pa; her sisters Shahara Ahmad-Llewellyn of Manhattan and Sayyida Ahmad Jordan of Los Angeles; her daughters Layla Alkhateeb of Arlington, Va., and Maha Buthayna Alkhateeb of Potomac Falls, Va.; and a grandson.       
         Rachael Dunaven Yocom, a dance educator and theorist, died on Nov. 14 in Tucson, said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42nd Street redevelopment organization and a former student. She was 88.         Born in Corvallis, Ore., Dr. Yocom taught dance at schools and universities in Oregon, Idaho and Utah after receiving her doctorate at New York University in 1951. In New York City, she was chairwoman of the dance department from 1954 to 1972 at the High School of Performing Arts, the subject of the movie ''Fame,'' and was teacher in charge of the school from 1973 to 1975.         Dr. Yocom trained generations of New York dancers, among them Jacqulyn Buglisi, Laura Dean, Eliot Feld, Arthur Mitchell, Eleo Pomare, Ben Vereen, Edward Villella, Dudley Williams and Ms. Cahan. She wrote several books on physical education, sports and dance, including ''Modern Dance Techniques and Teaching'' (1946), written with Gertrude Shurr, an early Martha Graham dancer and longtime colleague. Dr. Yocom also wrote songs and was a dance photographer.         Dr. Yokom is survived by two sisters, Ruth Carkin of Tucson and Roberta Jean Fox of Eugene, Ore., and a brother, Raymond, of Lancaster, Pa.
