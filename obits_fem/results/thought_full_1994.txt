         Erica Glaser Wallach, who spent five years in Communist prisons at the height of the cold war on espionage charges that the Soviet authorities later said were false, died on Dec. 22 in Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton, Va. She was 71.         She died of cancer, said Renee Glaser, a cousin.         In 1950, Mrs. Wallach was arrested in what was then East Berlin, where she had gone to seek information about Noel H. and Herta Field, an American couple who had reared Mrs. Wallach and who had been arrested in Prague. The arrests focused worldwide attention on Soviet rule in Eastern Europe.         At the time of her arrest, Mrs. Wallach was married to Robert R. Wallach, a captain in the United States Army, and was living with him and their two children in Paris. Death Sentence Commuted         Mrs. Wallach was held in East Berlin, then in Moscow, where she was tried for espionage, found guilty and given a death sentence that was later commuted to 15 years in prison. In 1954 the Fields were released from prison in Hungary. At the same time, Mr. Field's brother, Hermann, who had been held in Czechoslokavia on espionage charges, was also released.         Mrs. Wallach was released from a Siberian labor camp in 1955 when the Soviet authorities declared that she was innocent of the charges against her. They never explained their change of mind.         Ms. Glaser said Mrs. Wallach had been trapped in a series of intrigues complicated by the fact that she had once worked for the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, and later had briefly been a member of the Communist Party.         "The Soviets thought she was an American spy, while the Western authorities believed she was working for the Communists, and she was caught in the middle of conflicting political forces in postwar Europe," Ms. Glaser said.         After rejoining her family in Warrenton, Mrs. Wallach taught French and Latin at the Highland School for 18 years.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of Burke, Va., and a daughter, Madeleine W. de Heller of Bougy-Villars, Switzerland.       
         Lili Damita, a French-born actress who became one of Hollywood's most glamorous celebrities in the early years of talking pictures, died on Monday in Good Samaritan Medical Center in Palm Beach, Fla. She was thought to be about 90, and she lived in Palm Beach.         She had Alzheimer's disease, The Associated Press reported.         Miss Damita was born in Paris. She spoke five languages and was filming in Berlin when Samuel Goldwyn brought her to Hollywood in 1928 to star with Ronald Colman in Joseph Conrad's "Rescue." A review in The New York Times noted that Miss Damita "is fascinatingly handsome and gives an intelligent performance" in a difficult role. Marriage and a Retirement         Over the next seven years she was seen in more than a dozen films, and the press chronicled her comings and goings, her rumored or real love affairs and every change of hairdo. Her career ended abruptly when she married Errol Flynn, a dashing newcomer to Hollywood, in 1935. She retired from acting and stayed retired after the marriage ended in 1942.         After "The Rescue" she starred in Thornton Wilder's "Bridge of San Luis Rey" (1929). She played opposite Victor McLaglen in "The Cock Eyed World" (1929); Gary Cooper in "Fighting Caravans" (1931); Adolphe Menjou, Laurence Olivier and Erich von Stroheim in "Friends and Lovers" (1931), and Jack Buchanan in "Brewster's Millions" (1935).         Her last film paired her with James Cagney in the "Frisco Kid." She also appeared on Broadway, making her stage debut in "Sons o' Guns" in 1930 with Goldwyn's permission. She starred with Bert Lahr and Eleanor Powell in "George White's Music Hall Varieties," a 1932 vaudeville show. Dancing and Singing         Miss Damita, whose name was originally Liliane Carre, spent much of her childhood at convents in Portugal, Spain and Greece, and she studied dancing in Belgium. As a teen-ager, she danced and sang for the troops in World War I. She then danced with the Paris Opera and, at 19, succeeded Mistinguette as star of the Casino de Paris Revue.         Miss Damita -- the name means little lady in Spanish -- had a son with Mr. Flynn, Sean, who was a photojournalist and who disappeared in Cambodia in 1970. Her second marriage in 1962 to Allen B. Loomis, an Iowa manufacturer, also ended in divorce.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Camille Helene Block Lehman, a respected and innovative interior designer, died on Tuesday at her home in Atlanta. She was 84.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Lehman began her career at 16, designing for a bathing-suit manufacturer. After graduating from the Parsons School of Design at 19, she was hired by the dress and jewelry designer Hattie Carnegie.         Later, Mrs. Lehman thought of several applications in the home for Lucite, then a new product, and traveled the country marketing her ideas.         Mrs. Lehman and her husband, Charles, founded Lehmans & Associates, which became a successful interior design firm. In 1966, she received a Burlington House award for outstanding interior design and space planning.         She was a member of the Board of Governors of the American Institute of Interior Designers and a Fellow of the American Society of Interior designers.         "No matter how ingenious her design solutions, she never forgot that real people were going to eat, sleep and live in the rooms she created," said Dorothy Kalins, editor of Garden Design magazine.         The Lehmans continued to work in interior design until Mr. Lehman's death in 1990.         She is survived by her sons, John and Jeffrey, and two granddaughters, Kristin and Heather.       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.
