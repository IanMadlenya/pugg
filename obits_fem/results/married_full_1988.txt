Ann Rork Light, who was a silent film actress, died here Saturday at the Vanderbilt University Hospital. She was 79 years old and was being treated for emphysema and lung cancer.         The daughter of Samuel Edwin, a Hollywood producer, she appeared in films with Rudolph Valentino and Will Rogers, who also was her godfather.         In the 1930's Mrs. Light married J. Paul Getty, the oil magnate. In 1960, she married Dr. Ruldolph Light, an heir to the Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company and a professor of neurosurgery.       
        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations. Actress, Trend-Setter and Author         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips.         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after the end of her career, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned a million dollars a year from films and she was also an author, writing ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' In another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' she dealt with an elaborate miniature doll house she built in the mid-1920's that cost $470,000 and was designed in the form of a castle, complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio. The doll house later was sent around the country for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Michigan on Aug. 19, 1902. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse. 'A New Type Was Born'         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper.         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         In 1937 she married Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, her third husband, and ended her film career. She had previously been married to a film producer, John McCormick, and a New York broker, Albert F. Scott. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children, whom she came to consider her own. He died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daugher, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman, several grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

        Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959.         Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959. In between, she appeared with the New York City Ballet. Celebrated for her interpretations of the psychological ballets of Antony Tudor, she also danced in works by Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins.         The memorial included speeches by two ballerinas: Alicia Alonso, the Cuban dancer who was part of American Ballet Theater from 1940 until 1955, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, the former star of England's Royal Ballet. ''In her dance,'' Ms. Alonso said of Ms. Kaye, ''there was life always.'' Dame Margot called Ms. Kaye ''the most wonderful friend - understanding, perceptive, encouraging.''         Mr. Robbins analyzed Ms. Kaye's dramatic gift, saying that he believed she was theatrically striking not because she was flamboyant, but because of her gestural economy. Mr. Robbins recalled how last summer, while sitting at a cafe in Spoleto, Italy, he fancied he saw Ms. Kaye pass by.         Other tributes came from Leo Lerman, the theatrical writer; Mike Nichols, the director, and John Taras, Ballet Theater's associate director. Several speakers recalled how Ms. Kaye assisted her second husband, Herbert Ross, the choreographer and director, in his theatrical and film projects. Musical Tributes, as Well         Ms. Kaye had been married first to the violinist Isaac Stern. Mr. Stern was present to play Mozart's Violin Sonata in E minor, with Leonard Bernstein as pianist. Other musical selections included songs by Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook. Leslie Browne and Robert Hill, of Ballet Theater, offered an excerpt from Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading.''         The afternoon's touching conclusion came when Lynn Seymour, a British ballerina whose intensity has been likened to that of Ms. Kaye, danced Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.'' When she stepped forward scattering rose petals, she could have been offering a floral tribute to Ms. Kaye.         Then, with Mr. Bernstein at the piano, Stephanie Friede sang ''Im Abendrot,'' one of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' which accompanied Tudor's ''Hail and Farewell,'' his last ballet for Ms. Kaye. It had been given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1959, with Ms. Kaye as guest artist; she retired in 1961. Possessing a theme that symbolized death and transfiguration, ''Im Abendrot'' sounded especially eloquent.       
        Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.       
        Iris Vinton, an author of many children's books, died of breast cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         Iris Vinton, an author of many children's books, died of breast cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         Ms. Vinton was born in West Point, Miss., and came to New York in the 1930's, when she published several short plays. Her best-known children's novels - such as ''Flying Ebony'' (1947), which was made into a movie called ''The Mooncussers''; ''The Black Horse Company'' (1950); ''Longbow Island'' (1957) and ''Look Out for Pirates!'' - were adventure stories based on real incidents.         She contributed to several Nancy Drew mysteries, compiled a book of games from around the world, published many magazine articles and wrote a number of biographies geared to children, including a 1967 work on President Kennedy. She was director of publications for the Boys Clubs of America for 20 years, and was an active member of Pen and Brush and the Women's National Book Association. She was married to Louis German, who died in 1969.         Ms. Vinton is survived by two sisters, Ila Vinton and Lorraine Vinton Farrell, both of San Antonio.       
        Chaya Moussia Schneerson, the wife of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, died early yesterday at New York Hospital. She was taken to the hospital Tuesday night complaining about feeling ill. She was 86 years old and lived in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.         Chaya Moussia Schneerson, the wife of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, died early yesterday at New York Hospital. She was taken to the hospital Tuesday night complaining about feeling ill. She was 86 years old and lived in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.         Thousands of her husband's followers - dressed in the black garb of the Hasidim - lined the streets for the funeral procession that began outside her home on President Street yesterday afternoon and moved slowly past the headquarters of the Lubavitch movement at 770 Eastern Parkway, near Brooklyn Avenue.         Burial was at the Old Montefiore cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Schneerson, who was known as the Rebbetzin, was born in the Russian city of Lubavitch, the second of three daughters of the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchak Schneerson. She married Menachem Schneerson, her third cousin, in Warsaw in 1928. Together they fled Hitler, living in Paris, Nice and eventually settling in Brooklyn, in 1941.         Upon her father's death in 1950, her husband succeeded him as the Rebbe, or grand rabbi, of Lubavitch, one of the major remaining Hasidic dynasties. In keeping with Hasidic tradition, Mrs. Schneerson never held formal office in the Lubavitch organization, but ''she was very much behind the scenes,'' according to her husband's close aide, Rabbi Yehudah Krinsky.         ''In her quiet behind-the-scenes way, she was involved in every activity of Lubavitch,'' he said.         Surviving are her husband and a sister, Hannah Gourary.       
        Dorothy Kurgans Goldberg, an artist, writer and human rights advocate, died of lung cancer Saturday at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Dorothy Kurgans Goldberg, an artist, writer and human rights advocate, died of lung cancer Saturday at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Goldberg, the wife of Arthur J. Goldberg, the former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, was born in St. Louis. She earned bachelor's degrees in art from the University of Chicago and the Art Institute of Chicago and, in 1932, a doctorate in art from the University of Chicago.         Mrs. Goldberg had several one-person shows in New York and in Washington and helped establish community art programs in both cities. She also wrote several books, including ''The Creative Woman'' and ''A Private View of Public Life.'' Her most recent manuscript, dealing with international negotiations on human rights, is to be published soon.         In the late 1970's, Mrs. Goldberg served as a United States delegate to the Belgrade Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a follow-up to the Helsinki accords on human rights. She also was an observer at the Madrid follow-up conference on the Helsinki accords in 1981 and the Ottawa Conference on Human Rights in 1985.         Mrs. Goldberg married Justice Goldberg in 1931. After her husband's appointment as Secretary of Labor in the Kennedy Administration, Mrs. Goldberg organized Widening Horizons, a program to assist poor people seeking employment. She also organized Friends of the Juvenile Court, an organization to combat juvenile delinquency.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by a daughter, Barbara Cramer of Chicago; a son, Robert Goldberg, of Anchorage, Alaska, and six grandchildren. Funeral details were incomplete.       
        Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's chief delegate to the United Nations and one of her Government's leading voices on the international scene, died of cancer yesterday in a Managua hospital. Thirty-nine years old, she had been one of the Sandinistas' leading guerrilla heroes in the revolution that overthrew the Somoza regime in         Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's chief delegate to the United Nations and one of her Government's leading voices on the international scene, died of cancer yesterday in a Managua hospital. Thirty-nine years old, she had been one of the Sandinistas' leading guerrilla heroes in the revolution that overthrew the Somoza regime in July 1979.         A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Mission to the United Nations said Miss Astorga returned to Managua in early January because of her illness and was hospitalized Thursday. He said her deputy, Julio Icaza, had been acting in her stead.         Dr. Kevin M. Cahill of New York said he had treated Miss Astorga for breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy in 1986, followed by chemotherapy.         Bourgeois by background and style, Miss Astorga used her Catholic upbringing and legal career as cover for her early role as a guerrilla. She was best known for an operation in 1978 in which she lured Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle's second-in-command into her bedroom, where hidden assailants killed him. U.S. Refused Her as Envoy         Miss Astorga at the time was a corporate lawyer and mother of two. She said later that the Somoza aide, Gen. Reynaldo Perez Vega, was to have been abducted, interrogated and exchanged for 59 political prisoners. But there was a struggle, and the would-be kidnappers slit the general's throat instead, she said.         The general also worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, American and Nicaraguan officials said. The incident loomed large when the United States refused to accept her appointment as Ambassador to Washington in 1984.         After the Sandinista victory, Miss Astorga became chief special prosecutor in 1980 for the trials of 7,500 members of the Somoza regime's National Guard and other supporters of the ousted dynasty. Many of them drew long sentences, but most have been released since.         Miss Astorga then was named Deputy Foreign Minister to represent Nicaragua at international conferences. She also spoke for her country in 1983 and 1984 when the Contadora group of Latin American nation was searching for a peaceful settlement of the civil strife in Central America.         She presented her credentials to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar at the United Nations in March 1986. Her message, sounded often, was meant to counter Washington's charges that the Sandinistas were seeking to impose Marxism-Leninism on all of Central America and to challenge the United States to help resolve the region's conflicts through talks. An Atypical Revolutionary         ''Revolutions are not exportable like Coca-Cola or paperbacks or something like that,'' she told reporters. ''You don't produce it internally and send it away. Revolutions are made in a country when the conditions in that particular country are for a process of change.''         Miss Astorga stood out in her diplomatic surroundings not only as one of the few women in such a position. At 5 feet 11 inches in high heels, she seldom went unnoticed, with her sleek frame fitted in dress-for-success clothes and her hair smartly cropped. She spoke Americanized English as well as Italian and loved classical music - not the typical portrait of a revolutionary.         While at the United Nations, she lived in a six-bedroom house in Scarsdale with her mother and her five children, including an adopted son who was the child of a friend killed in the revolution. All the children attended schools in Westchester County.         Nora Astorga Gadea was the daughter of a wealthy lumber exporter and rancher. The Astorga family - she kept her maiden name - had been associated with the Somoza regime since her grandfather was Defense Minister.         Driven to excel, she studied sociology at Catholic University in Washington before taking her law degree at the Jesuit-run Catholic University in Managua. There she began her secret work for the Sandinistas, passing messages and buying supplies.         At 22, she married Jorge Jenkins, a student dissident, and the couple spent a year in Italy, where he studied archeology and she banking law. They had two children before they parted after five years.         After the Peres Vega killing, Miss Astorga fled to a training camp where she commanded a military squad and became the lover of Jose Maria Alvarado, a member of the Sandinista inner circle, with whom she had two children.       
        Martha Granger Krock, a former society columnist in Chicago and Washington, died of pneumonia yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 87 years old and lived in Washington.         Martha Granger Krock, a former society columnist in Chicago and Washington, died of pneumonia yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 87 years old and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Krock was a society columnist for the Hearst Newspapers in Chicago briefly in the early 1930's. She moved to Washington in 1933 and wrote a column, ''These Charming People,'' for The Times-Herald until 1939.         That year she married Arthur Krock, the four-time Pulitizer Prize winner, who for many years was the Washington columnist and bureau chief of The New York Times. He died in 1974.         A prominent hostess in Washington, she was also long active in charities. During World War II, she was chief of the American Women's Voluntary Services and was decorated in 1947 by the Belgian Government for her work.         Mrs. Krock was born in Lake Forest, Ill., a daughter of Alfred Hoyt Granger, an architect, and Belle Hughitt Granger. Mrs. Krock was related to William Tecumseh Sherman, the Civil War general, and to John Sherman, Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes and Secretary of State under President William McKinley.         Her first marriage, to William Mitchell Blair of Chicago, ended in divorce in 1932.         Surviving are a son, William Granger Blair of Manhattan, a reporter for The Times; a sister, Barbara Shepard of Menasha, Wis., and Carefree, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
        Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Best known for her insight into the everyday activities of American women, young and old, and for her studies of life as it was lived in and near Union Square from 1930 until the present day, Miss Bishop was the living continuation of a specific and distinctively American idiom.         That idiom, which was pioneered at the turn of this century by Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, George Luks, John Sloan and others, was reportorial in style, anecdotal in tone and shorn of all extraneous or merely complimentary material. It was intended to seize a moment, tell a tale, and give a renewed dignity to people for whom high art in this country had not often had a place. A Perceptive Observer         On the street corner, in the automat, in the subway and on park benches in fine weather, Miss Bishop proved herself a perceptive observer. For young women in the big city who were as yet unmarked by life, she had a particular feeling. But she was alert to the potential both for happiness and for an irrevocable, untold misery that exists at every stage of metropolitan life.         For all the rapid, spontaneous, firsthand qulity of her observation, she knew how to reach back into European Old Master painting for support and encouragement. John H. Baur, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, once said of her work that ''in some mysterious manner which I do not really understand, her paintings carry forward the great tradition of north European 17th-century figure painting.''         Miss Bishop cherished that connection, and once said that ''you may have true gifts and the ability to make something that is new and surprising, but if your work hasn't any connections and your gift gives out, you haven't any leverage.'' Optimistic Viewpoint         When she first came to New York in the early 1920s, determined to become an artist, Miss Bishop studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois, both of whom had studied with Robert Henri.         From Pene du Bois, and later from her close friend, the painter Reginald Marsh, Miss Bishop learned to sharpen and perfect her sense of a New York subject. But neither age nor familiarity ever eroded her inherently optimistic approach to life. In her late work, it was as apparent as ever she had an unsentimental confidence that one day, somehow, the lot of women in the city would be changed for the better, Miss Bishop was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 3, 1902, the daughter of John Remsen Bishop, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Anna Bartram Bishop. Her father moved his large family from Princeton to the Midwest in hopes of giving them a more comfortable life. The failure of this venture, and the experience of genteel poverty in Detroit, gave her a lifelong sympathy with underprivileged people. Moved to New York in 1918         In 1918 she moved to New York and studied at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. Shortly after leaving the Art Students League in 1924, she began to work in the Union Square area, where she eventually took rank as the unofficial but unquestioned visual historian.         In 1932, she joined the Midtown Gallery in Manhattan, with which she remained closely affiliated for the rest of her life. A member of the National Academy of Design since 1941, she was vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters from 1944-46, a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London in 1964, a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971, and the recipient of honorary doctorates at Bates College, Mount Holyoke College and Syracuse University. She also received the gold medal of the National Arts Club in 1968 and 1970, the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts award (presented by President Carter) in 1979, and the gold medal for painting from the National Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1987.

        Gloria Hollister Anable, an explorer, scientist and conservationist who set a women's world record for ocean descent in a bathysphere in 1931, died of cardiac arrest Friday at the Carolton convalescent home in Fairfield, Conn., where she had lived for three years. She was 87 years old and had previously lived in         Gloria Hollister Anable, an explorer, scientist and conservationist who set a women's world record for ocean descent in a bathysphere in 1931, died of cardiac arrest Friday at the Carolton convalescent home in Fairfield, Conn., where she had lived for three years. She was 87 years old and had previously lived in Stamford.         Miss Hollister, as she was known during most of her scientific career, became a celebrity in the 1930's, a time when only a handful of women earned headlines for their feats in a man's world of discovery.         Miss Hollister was a longtime associate of Dr. William Beebe, the oceanographer. She was his chief assistant on many of his voyages of exploration in the late 20's and 30's, and she served with other expeditions of the New York Zoological Society, of which she was a fellow.         In 1936 she led an exploring party through the jungles of British Guiana to the Kaieteur Falls, five times the height of Niagara. On that trip, using a light plane, she discovered 43 waterfalls. Studied Fish on Sea Floor         Born in New York City, she graduated in 1924 from Connecticut College for Women, where she was twice chosen class president, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was selected a member of the All-America girls' hockey team. She earned a master's degree in zoology at Columbia and worked with Dr. Alexis Carrel on cancer research at the Rockefeller Institute. A fellow institute volunteer at the time was Charles A. Lindbergh.         In 1928 she was invited to accompany Dr. Beebe as a research associate on a voyage to the waters near Bermuda, where she studied fish on the sea floor 20 feet to 40 feet down. Two years later, after another Beebe associate, Otis Barton, had built the first bathysphere, she went with them to explore deep-sea life. It was on one of these expeditions that she went down 410 feet for the women's descent record.         Though much of her exploration was beneath the ocean surface or in remote lands, she also explored the inner world of nature in the laboratory of the Zoological Society, where she worked with Dr. Beebe and other scientists. She referred to herself as a detective seeking nature's secrets.         In 1941 Miss Hollister married Anthony Anable and after World War II they moved to Stamford. In the early 50's they, with a few others, founded the Mianus River Gorge Conservation Committee, the pioneer land project of The Nature Conservancy. The gorge became the country's first natural history landmark to be registered by the Department of the Interior. The preserve, orginally 60 acres, now embraces 555 acres. Mrs. Anable was chairman emeritus of the committee at her death.         Mrs. Anable is survived by two nieces, Gloria Musselman of Lexington Park, Md., and Elizabeth Miller of Columbus, Ga.       
        Isabel Hoopes Grinnell, a former assistant curator in the department of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum, died Tuesday at a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 89 years old and until recently lived in New York City and Waquoit, Mass.         Isabel Hoopes Grinnell, a former assistant curator in the department of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum, died Tuesday at a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 89 years old and until recently lived in New York City and Waquoit, Mass.         A native of West Chester, Pa., Mrs. Grinnell graduated from Goucher College in 1919 and joined the Metropolitan staff that year. In 1931 she married Dr. Robert S. Grinnell, a surgeon. She left the museum staff in 1932 but continued to work on a book, ''Greek Temples,'' a study of the 25 most important temples, which was published by the museum in 1943 and reissued in 1975.         Mrs. Grinnell is survived by a brother, John R. Hoopes, of Sarasota, Fla.; a sister, Helen Lapp, of Hatboro, Pa.; a daughter, Nancy G. Barnum, of Washington; three sons, Robert S. Jr., of Guilderland, N.Y., Alexander, of New York City, and Lawrence I., of Waitsfield, Vt., and five grandchildren.

Alice Dresel Beal Van Santvoord, a patron of artists and a contributor to theatrical and educational institutions, died of complications following surgery Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Newburgh.         Mrs. Van Santvoord befriended and served as benefactor for such well-known artists as Childe Hassam, Walt Kuhn and Timothy Cole, the woodcarver. She contributed to a wide variety of projects, among them the Museum for Experimental Theater at Vassar and the Thaddeus Reynolds Beal Fund of Yale University.         Mrs. Van Santvoord had been married to Thaddeus Reynolds Beal, the first president of the Hudson Gas and Electric Company. After his death in 1933, she married George Van Santvoord, the late headmaster of the Hotchkiss School, a private preparatory school in Lakeville, Conn.         She is survived by three children, John Wilkie Beal of Newburgh, Alger Dresel Beal of Bennington, Vt., and Alice Louise Curten of Hyde Park, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

Suzy Frelinghuysen, a former opera singer and a painter whose work is increasingly recognized by collectors and museums, died of a stroke on Saturday in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         An admirer of Juan Gris and Georges Braque, Ms. Frelinghuysen was best known for her paintings and collages of the 1940's, done in a synthetic Cubist style reminiscent of theirs, but with the formal elements manipulated in a highly personal manner. Ms. Frelinghuysen recently sold a work to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Born to a socially prominent New Jersey family in 1912, she was named Estelle Condit Frelinghuysen, but preferred the nickname Suzy, bestowed by her brothers. She attended Miss Fine's School in Princeton, and then studied voice. She married the abstract painter George L. K. Morris in 1935 Under the name of Suzy Morris, she won considerable acclaim for several seasons as a soprano with the City Center Opera, making her debut in ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' in 1947.         Ms. Frelinghuysen, whose husband died in 1975, is survived by a brother, Griswold Frelinghuysen, of Vermont.       
        Hester R. McCullough, whose denunciation of two entertainers as Communist supporters became a nationwide political issue in the late 1940's, died of renal cancer Sunday at her home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 71 years old.         Hester R. McCullough, whose denunciation of two entertainers as Communist supporters became a nationwide political issue in the late 1940's, died of renal cancer Sunday at her home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 71 years old.         Mrs. McCullough, then living in Greenwich, Conn., returned a subscription ticket to a local performance by Paul Draper, a dancer, and Larry Adler, a virtuoso of the harmonica, whom she accused of being members of Communist front organizations.         In a letter published in a local newspaper, Mrs. McCullough wrote that the entertainers, ''while fine artists, have been openly denounced in the press as being pro-Communist and, as such, I do not believe should appear in any community project in Greenwich.''         The artists brought a $200,000 libel suit against Mrs. McCullough, which resulted in a hung jury in May 1950 and was later dismissed on a legal technicality.         Meanwhile, the charges had become a cause celebre among political columnists of the period. Her supporters included Westbrook Pegler and Fulton Lewis Jr. Unable to find work in the United States during the period of the suit, Mr. Adler and Mr. Draper left the country for several years.         Mrs. McCullough was born in Philadelphia and was a graduate of London University. She married John T. McCullough, a former picture editor at Time magazine, who died in 1978.         She is survived by a son, Bruce, of Los Angeles.       
        Lois Wilson, an actress who appeared in more than 100 early films including the 1923 Western epic ''The Covered Wagon,'' died of pneumonia on March 3 at Riverside Hospital for Skilled Care. She was 93 years old.         Lois Wilson, an actress who appeared in more than 100 early films including the 1923 Western epic ''The Covered Wagon,'' died of pneumonia on March 3 at Riverside Hospital for Skilled Care. She was 93 years old.         Miss Wilson sought fame in Hollywood after winning a 1915 statewide beauty contest in her native Alabama. After her arrival in Hollywood, she landed a small part in ''The Dumb Girl of Portici,'' which starred the ballerina Anna Pavlova. She went on to act in more than 100 silent and sound films over the next 33 years.         Her best-known portrayals included Molly Wingate in ''The Covered Wagon'' and Daisy Buchanan in the 1926 version of ''The Great Gatsby.'' She acted opposite such leading men as Rudolph Valentino and John Gilbert.         After retiring from motion pictures in 1941 - except for a bit part in the 1949 comedy ''The Girl From Jones Beach,'' starring Ronald Reagan -Miss Wilson turned to the Broadway stage and eventually television.         ''The Guiding Light'' and ''The Edge of Night'' were among the network soap operas in which she played featured character roles.         Although she never married, Miss Wilson was once described as cultivating a screen image of ''the soft, marrying kind of woman.'' Selected in 1924 by Paramount to represent the motion-picture industry at the British Empire Exposition, Miss Wilson was termed ''a typical example of the American girl in character, culture and beauty.''         Miss Wilson was buried Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, Calif., after a service at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.

She was 88 years old and a former resident of Worcester and, more recently, Montreal.         Mrs. Pincus was the widow of Dr. Gregory Pincus, one of the three ''fathers'' of the birth control pill, whom she married in 1924. He died in 1967 at the age of 64.         A native of the Ukraine, she was brought to this country as a child and attended McGill University in Montreal.         Mrs. Pincus is survived by a son, John, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Laura P.

        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Mystery in Sculpture         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left.         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.

Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's and was shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting people of her time. Known for Wall Sculptures         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev in the Ukraine in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in the Ukraine until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest. A Feeling For Wood         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Mr. Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.

In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters and two great-granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Eva Novak, an actress who starred as Tom Mix's love interest in 10 of his westerns and did her own stunts as well, died of pneumonia on Sunday at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90 years old.         Eva Novak, an actress who starred as Tom Mix's love interest in 10 of his westerns and did her own stunts as well, died of pneumonia on Sunday at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90 years old.         Miss Novak, who was born in St. Louis, came to Hollywood as a teen-ager. She worked in slapstick comedies and was a bathing beauty for Mack Sennett. Among her films as leading lady for Tom Mix were ''Sky High'' and ''Trailin'.'' She also was the leading lady in three films for William S. Hart.         In 1921 she married William Reed, a director and stuntman, and the couple went to Australia in the late 1920's to make a series of westerns there.         She returned to the United States in the 1930's and appeared in a number of films directed by John Ford, an old friend, who cast her in such classics as ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' ''Stagecoach'' and ''Fort Apache.'' She also played a nun in ''The Bells of St. Mary's.''         Miss Novak is survived by her sister, Jane, 2 daughters, 10 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.       
        Irene Rich, the urbane star of scores of silent films of the 1920's and a popular radio personality of the 30's, died of heart failure Friday at her home in Hope Ranch, Calif., outside Santa Barbara. She was 96 years old.         Irene Rich, the urbane star of scores of silent films of the 1920's and a popular radio personality of the 30's, died of heart failure Friday at her home in Hope Ranch, Calif., outside Santa Barbara. She was 96 years old.         With chiseled features, aristocratic bearing and a trim figure accented by smart gowns and coiffeurs, she was for more than two decades a role model for millions of American women.         She entered the movies as an extra in 1918, and once estimated that she had made more than 60 pictures. In seven, she was the upwardly striving wife of the humorist Will Rogers.         For more than a decade a national radio audience regularly tuned to her dramatic series, ''Dear John.'' For the Benefit of Grapes         Her sponsor was Welch's grape juice, and in succeeding years, her svelte image became indelibly linked with the product, which she winningly touted as the key to being slender. Welch's said she had increased sales by 638 percent, and she told an interviewer that the sponsor was ''frank enough to say that I have brought him so much business that it has just saved his shirt - I think it's kind of swell.''         The actress was born Irene Luther in Buffalo on Oct. 13, 1891, the daughter of William and Mabel Luther, who later moved to the isolated mining town of Stites, Idaho.         When her parents decided to send her to boarding school, she eloped at the age of 17. The marriage, to Elvo Deffenbaugh, produced a daughter, Frances, and ended in divorce in two years. She married Maj. Charles Rich of the Army, with whom she had a daughter, Jane. The couple were divorced four years later, and the 24-year-old Miss Rich began supporting herself and her two daughters by successfully selling real estate in San Francisco.         She went to Hollywood in 1918, became an extra in silent films and was soon playing leading roles with such actors as Dustin and William Farnum, Lon Chaney, Clive Brook, Ronald Colman and Lewis Stone.         Miss Rich later dismissed her screen image as ''the doormat in an endless series of domestic films,'' but she skillfully played a number of challenging roles, including a worldly Edwardian in the 1925 screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ''Lady Windermere's Fan.'' She was also the screen's first ''Craig's Wife,'' the antiseptic shrew who tormented Warner Baxter in the 1928 silent film of George Kelly's benchmark play. Portrayed Mothers in the 30's         Her comedies with Will Rogers included ''Jes' Call Me Jim'' (1920), ''They Had to See Paris'' (1929) and ''Down to Earth'' (1932).         By the 30's, Miss Rich invariably portrayed mothers, as in ''The Champ'' (1931), with Jackie Cooper and Wallace Beery, and ''That Certain Age'' (1938), with Deanna Durbin. Her later occasional film appearances included supporting roles in two 1948 epics, ''Fort Apache,'' directed by John Ford, and ''Joan of Arc,'' starring Ingrid Bergman.         In vaudeville, Miss Rich did nearly 5,000 performances in a dramatic sketch called ''Ask the Wife.'' On Broadway, Miss Rich was the nation's first female President, deftly cueing one-liners for the madcap comic Bobby Clark in the long-running musical ''As the Girls Go'' in 1948-50. Retired in 1950         The actress also had a talent for business. In the 30's and 40's she owned and operated a 300-acre stock farm outside Los Angeles, producing food, feed, poultry and livestock. Every phase of the enterprise showed a profit. In World War II, she served as a lieutenant in the Women's Ambulance and Defense Corps.         In early 1950, when ''As the Girls Go'' was about to end its Broadway run, Miss Rich was married to George Henry Clifford, a businessman, and announced her retirement. Mr. Clifford died in 1959.         In reviewing ''As the Girls Go,'' Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote that ''Miss Rich is a lady who presides over the whole rumpus with warmth, charm and good manners, and the show has the good taste to respect her quality.''         She is survived by her two daughters, two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.       
        Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Judge Matthews was named to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by President Truman in 1949. At the time of her nomination, she was a familiar figure in Washington as a lawyer for the National Women's Party and an active campaigner for women's rights.         Judge Matthews presided over a number of major trials, including the 1957 bribery trial of James R. Hoffa, then vice president of the teamsters' union, at which he was acquitted. Help From Friends in Senate         She recalled in an interview several years ago that her friendship with a number of senators had blunted opposition to the notion of a woman on the Federal bench. When her nomination was being considered, one of the judges on the district court, T. Alan Goldsborough, said publicly that while ''Mrs. Matthews would be a good judge,'' there was ''just one thing wrong: she's a woman.''         While Judge Goldsborough told her some years later that his opposition had been mistaken, she received an icy welcome from her fellow judges, who agreed among themselves to assign her all the ''long motions,'' the most technical and least rewarding part of the court's docket.         Judge Matthews never retired from the court. In 1968 she took senior status, permitting her to reduce her workload on the district court while also hearing occasional cases in other Federal courts in Washington. She sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. She continued hearing district court cases until five years ago.         Judge Matthews retained a strong sense of her own role as a pioneer, and never wavered in her commitment to expanding opportunities for women. In a 1985 interview with the Third Branch, a newsletter published by the Federal court system, she said she had always chosen women to be her law clerks.         ''The reason I always had women,'' she said, ''was because so often, when a woman makes good at something they always say that some man did it. So I just thought it would be better to have women. I wanted to show my confidence in women.''         Burnita Shelton decided as a young girl that she wanted to be a lawyer, although professional opportunities in the law were extremely limited for women. She was born Dec. 28, 1894, in Copiah County, Mississippi, where her father owned a plantation and served as clerk of the local chancery court. She often accompanied him to court. But while the family sent her brother to law school, she was sent to the Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati, where she studied voice and piano.         She was teaching piano when the United States entered World War I. Hoping to find a Government job that would enable her to go to law school at night, she moved to Washington, passed a Civil Service examination, and took a job with the Veterans Administration. She went to night school at National University Law School, which later became part of George Washington University.         After her graduation in 1919, Mrs. Matthews, now married to a lawyer, Percy A. Matthews, applied to the Veterans Administration for a job as a lawyer. When the agency told her that it would never hire a woman in the legal department, she opened her own law office. More Obstacles to Legal Career         There were other stumbling blocks as well. The local bar association refused to accept her application for membership, returning the check she had sent for membership dues. Judge Matthews included that check among the papers she donated to what is now the Burnita Shelton Matthews Collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, at Radcliffe College.         Her activities on behalf of women's rights began in law school. In 1919, she was among several dozen women who regularly picketed the White House on Sundays on behalf of women's suffrage. ''You could carry a banner,'' she recalled in the 1985 interview, ''but if you spoke, you were arrested for speaking without a permit. So when they asked me why I was there, I didn't answer.''         After women got the vote in 1920, she shifted the focus of her activities. She became the lawyer for the National Woman's Party, which was trying to persuade state legislatures to lift legal barriers to women. Mrs. Matthews researched state laws and drafted proposed bills. The National Woman's Party owned the property across the street from the Capitol where the Supreme Court's building is now located. In the 1920's, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft proposed acquiring the land for the Court, she went to the Chief Justice's home to try to persuade him to look elsewhere. Her efforts failed, but she represented the party in the condemnation proceedings and won a generous settlement for it.         In the 1940's she also taught at the Washington College of Law, now part of American University. Upheld Right of Black Muslims         In 1949, President Truman named her to one of 20 new district judgeships that Congress had created to relieve a backlog in district court dockets. Among her rulings was one upholding the right of Black Muslims in the local prison to conduct religious services.         In a 1955 case, she refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer Paul Robeson, who was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and of supporting various pro-Communist activities, . Mr. Robeson's passport was withheld from 1950 to 1958 and was restored to him when, in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled the State Department's action unconstitutional.         On the Court of Appeals, Judge Matthews ruled that the Social Security Administration could not cut off disability benefits without a hearing.         In 1984, President Reagan commended her for her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit.''         Her husband died in 1969. They had no children. Judge Matthews is survived by four sisters-in-law and 11 nieces and nephews. She will be buried in the family cemetery in Copiah County, Mississippi.       
        Christina Paolozzi Bellin, a former model and an international social figure in the 1960's, died of a brain tumor Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old.         Christina Paolozzi Bellin, a former model and an international social figure in the 1960's, died of a brain tumor Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old.         The daughter of Alicia Spaulding, a United Fruit Company heiress, and Count Lorenzo Paolozzi, she was born in New York, grew up in Rome, and was educated in Switzerland and at the Madeira School in Greenway, Va.         She began her modeling career in New York at age 17. A nude photograph of her by Richard Avedon in Harper's Bazaar in 1962 caused a sensation. Unclothed figures did not appear in fashion magazines at that time.         In 1964, she married Dr. Howard Bellin, a plastic surgeon. They were known for their lively parties attended by an eclectic group that included Andy Warhol, Jacob K. Javits, Zsa Zsa Gabor, karate instructors and whatever glamorous personality happened to be in town, Dr. Bellin recalled. They were divorced in 1982, remarried four months later when Mrs. Bellin fell ill, and divorced again when she seemed to be recovering.         She is survived by two sons, Marco and Andy, her sister, Francesca, and her mother, all of Manhattan.         The funeral will be at 3 P.M. tomorrow at St. James Episcopal Church, at 865 Madison Avenue, at 71st Street in Manhattan.         Correction:  April 30, 1988, Saturday, Late City Final Edition       
        Elaine Black Yoneda, a radical labor activist during the Depression and the 1934 San Francisco general strike, died of a heart attack here on Thursday. She was 81 years old.         Elaine Black Yoneda, a radical labor activist during the Depression and the 1934 San Francisco general strike, died of a heart attack here on Thursday. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Yoneda, known in labor circles as ''the Red Angel'' and as ''Tiger Woman'' in the Hearst newspapers because of her militancy, was the only woman on the steering committee of the 1934 San Francisco general strike, which was a response to the killing of two longshoremen participating in a West Coast walkout.         Until she retired in 1973, Mrs. Yoneda was a clerical worker for the pension fund of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union-Pacific Maritime Association. She was a member of Local 29 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union until this year and was president of the women's auxiliary of Local 16 of the longshoremen's union. Became a Communist         She was born in New York City on Sept. 4, 1906. She moved to Los Angeles in 1931 and there joined the Communist Party. She was active with International Labor Defense, a group that worked for the legal rights of strikers and others active in the labor movement.         She met a young Japanese-American and fellow Communist named Karl Yoneda when she went to bail him out of jail, where he was being held for strike activities. They were married in 1933.         Her husband said her death came on the 55th anniversary of their wedding as they were preparing to celebrate.         Mr. Yoneda said they had remained members of the party: ''We believe in minority parties. If you let the big shots run the country, what will happen to us?'' Husband Interned in War         In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed an order for the internment of people of Japanese ancestry. Mr. Yoneda was interned at the camp at Manzanar, Calif.         Mr. Yoneda said his wife and son remained with him until he volunteered to perform intelligence work for the United States military against the Japanese Army in Burma. Mrs. Yoneda was allowed to move with her son to San Francisco, but for the next two years she had to report monthly to military authorities on the child's whereabouts, her husband said.         In later years, she remained active in union and political work. The day before she died, she attended a longshoremen's rally for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign, her husband said.         A private funeral service was held Saturday in San Francisco. In addition to her husband, Ms. Yoneda's survivors are her daughter from a previous marriage, Joyce Ebangelista, her son, Thomas Yoneda, and two grandchildren.       
        Cleo Hartwig, a sculptor whose works featuring animals, birds and other natural subjects were inspired by her childhood in rural Michigan, died of cancer of the pancreas yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Cleo Hartwig, a sculptor whose works featuring animals, birds and other natural subjects were inspired by her childhood in rural Michigan, died of cancer of the pancreas yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Hartwig's work is in the permanent collections of many American museums, including the National Academy of Design, the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.         Miss Hartwig, a petite woman who wore her hair in a trademark ponytail, was a sculpture instructor at the Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J., from 1945 to 1971 and had previously taught sculpture at Cooper Union. Her work was usually carved from wood or stone, and she was sculpturing until shortly before she died, said Renata Manasse Schwebel, a fellow sculptor and longtime friend.         She was known among her colleagues as a woman who shunned the limelight herself but was a fervid supporter of other artists' careers.         ''When you met her, you thought she was a very shy, little birdie of a person,'' Ms. Schwebel said. ''Underneath it, if you ever tried to change her mind, she was total stainless steel.''         Miss Hartwig studied at Western Michigan University, the Art Institute of Chicago and the International School of Art in Manhattan.         In 1951, she married Vincent Glinsky, a sculptor, who was a founding member of the Sculptors Guild in Manhattan. For many years they shared a studio on West 16th Street. Mr. Glinsky died in 1975.         Miss Hartwig was a director of the National Sculpture Society, and the society's annual exhibition last year included two of her works: ''Owlet,'' a 1969 work in white Tennessee marble, and ''Guinea Fowl,'' a bronze executed in 1986.         She is survived by a son, Albert Glinsky of Manhattan.         The funeral will be private, and a memorial service is planned for a later date.       
        Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920's and 30's and the lifetime companion of the playwright Luigi Pirandello, died after suffering a stroke on her 88th birthday Friday in a Milan nursing home, her family announced today.         Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920's and 30's and the lifetime companion of the playwright Luigi Pirandello, died after suffering a stroke on her 88th birthday Friday in a Milan nursing home, her family announced today.         Miss Abba entered Milan's drama school when she was 15 and began her career in 1923 with the stage company of the director Ettore Paladini. She drew acclaim the following year in Virgilio Talli's production of Anton Chekhov's ''Gabbiano.''         In 1925, she became the lead actress for Pirandello, the ground-breaking dramatist whose work often focused on the thin line between illusion and reality. Pirandello, who was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature, is considered by many to be one of the great writers of the 20th century European theater. Toured Together         After spending years in Rome performing such Pirandello plays as ''Six Characters in Search of An Author,'' the playwright and Miss Abba went on tour in Italy and abroad, including the United States, France, Britain and Germany.         Pirandello wrote several plays specifically for Miss Abba, including ''As You Desire Me'' in 1930.         In 1928-29, Miss Abba formed her own company of young actors, mostly performing plays of her mentor. In the 1930's, she expanded her repertory to include Shakespeare, Shaw and others. Married After Playwright's Death         Pirandello died in 1936. Two years later, Miss Abba married an American, S. A. Millikin, grandson of a Cleveland steel baron. She retired and settled in the United States.         After the marriage broke up, she moved back to Milan in 1953, returning briefly to the stage with a company in her own name.         She served on the board of the Institute of Pirandello Studies and Contemporary Italian Theater since 1962.         Two years ago, Miss Abba donated to Princeton University the 560 letters that Pirandello had written her.         Funeral services for Miss Abba are scheduled Monday in Milan.       
        Ella Raines, an actress who starred in film dramas, comedies and westerns during the 1940's, died of throat cancer May 30 in Los Angeles. She was 67 years old.         Ella Raines, an actress who starred in film dramas, comedies and westerns during the 1940's, died of throat cancer May 30 in Los Angeles. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Raines's film career took off in 1943. That year she starred opposite Randolph Scott in the wartime thriller ''Corvette K-255'' and became the only actress under contract to a new $1 million production company founded by Howard Hawks and Charles Boyer. Her best-known starring role was in the suspense film ''Phantom Lady'' in 1944. More often she appeared opposite some of the leading actors of the day, including John Wayne in ''Tall in the Saddle'' (1944), Charles Laughton in ''Suspect'' (1945) and William Powell in the Charles MacArthur-George S. Kaufman satire ''The Senator Was Indiscreet'' (1947). Worked With Preston Sturges         She also worked with the director Preston Sturges in ''Hail the Conquering Hero'' (1944). She starred in a television show, ''Janet Dean, R.N.'' in 1953-54. More recently, she appeared in an episode of television's ''Matt Houston,'' although she had largely been in retirement.         A two-year marriage to her high-school sweetheart, Kenneth Trout, a lieutenant in the Army Air Force, ended in divorce in 1945. In 1947 she married an Air Force major, Robin Olds. A hero in World War II and Vietnam, he later became a brigadier general and commander of the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs. They had two daughters.         After her marriage, Ms. Raines appeared in films less frequently. In 1967, when her husband was serving in Vietnam, she characterized herself in a newspaper article as ''an Army wife'' and paid tribute to ''service wives . . . for maintaining a home that is as normal as possible for the children while keeping their worries to themselves.''         She and her husband were divorced in 1975. She is survived by her daughters, Christina Newman and Susan Olds, and a granddaughter.       
        Mildred E. Gillars, nicknamed Axis Sally by American soldiers in World War II for her Nazi propaganda radio broadcasts, died of cancer of the colon last Saturday at Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She was 87 years old and lived in Columbus.         Mildred E. Gillars, nicknamed Axis Sally by American soldiers in World War II for her Nazi propaganda radio broadcasts, died of cancer of the colon last Saturday at Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She was 87 years old and lived in Columbus.         An American living in Berlin, she broadcast programs in English to the Allied forces in Europe and North Africa, messages designed to heighten loneliness, fatigue and the futility of fighting Germany. After the war she was arrested and brought to the United States, where she was tried and imprisoned for treason.         Her trial in 1949 attracted enormous public attention, as much for the soap-opera quality of Miss Gillars's life as for her crime.         She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and was fined $10,000. After serving 12 years, she was released on parole from the Federal Reformatory for Women in Alderson, W.Va. She then taught music in the convent school of the Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus in Columbus. Release From Prison         Miss Gillars was born Mildred Elizabeth Sisk in Portland, Me., but she changed her name. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University from 1918 to 1922. After her release from prison, she returned to the university and graduated in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in speech.         Conflicting reports about her life abroad say that she studied piano in Dresden, modeled in Paris and was a dressmaker's assistant in Algiers and an English teacher in Berlin. She arrived in Berlin in 1934 and broadcast in English on the German radio before the war. Arrest in 1946         When she was arrested in 1946, Miss Gillars said she had moved to Germany to marry a German citizen, who later died. The man was Max Otto Koischwitz, a former professor at Hunter College in New York who was an official in the German Foreign Office.         At her trial, Miss Gillars fascinated the public and the press with her flamboyance and cool self-possession. She cut a theatrical figure in tight-fitting black dresses, long silver hair and a deep tan. She had scarlet lips and nails. Miss Gillars ''has the hair of Mother machree and she wears it in the manner of Rita Hayworth,'' Richard H. Rovere wrote in The New Yorker of Feb. 26, 1949.         She sent a frisson through the trial when she described her obsessive love affair with Mr. Koischwitz, who was married. The program she was convicted of participating in, ''Vision of Invasion,'' was written by her lover. It was broadcast on May 11, 1944, only weeks before the June 6 invasion of Normandy. Mr. Koischwitz was reported to have died in the Soviet capture of Berlin in the spring of 1945.         After the war, Miss Gillars was found roaming, hungry and homeless, near Frankfurt am Main, seeking to regain her American citizenship. At her trial, she was said to have renounced American citizenship while living in Germany and American officials reported that in 1941 she had refused repatriation.         In 1950, a Federal appeals court upheld her conviction. It noted in its ruling that she had received the highest salary of all broadcasters on German radio.         After prison, her life in Columbus was quiet and reclusive. She had an unlisted telephone number and her records at Ohio Wesleyan are sealed. She is survived by at least one half-sister, who asked not to be identified.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.       
        Jean Porter Dubos, who collaborated in biological and environmental research for several decades with her husband, Rene Dubos, died of ovarian cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Jean Porter Dubos, who collaborated in biological and environmental research for several decades with her husband, Rene Dubos, died of ovarian cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Mrs. Dubos, who was born in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, joined the Dubos Laboratory at the Harvard Medical School in 1942 and moved two years later to the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) in New York City when Dr. Dubos rejoined it. Together, they established a new laboratory to study tuberculosis. They were married in 1946.         Mrs. Dubos was co-author with her husband in 1950 of ''The White Plague - Tuberculosis, Man and Society,'' which stressed the role of social reform rather than surgical intervention or drugs to control disease and was a forerunner of other works in the social history of medicine.         The couple's close collaboration led to several books on a philosophy of the human environment. Mrs. Dubos was a founder of the Rene Dubos Center for Human Environments, in which she remained active until her death.         Mrs. Dubos, whose husband died in 1982, is survived by a niece, Jennifer Porter of Cambridge, Mass.       
        Hope D. Brock, a member of the board of directors of the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan for 22 years, died Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston after a short illness. She was 70 years old and lived in Oyster Bay Cove, L.I.         Hope D. Brock, a member of the board of directors of the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan for 22 years, died Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston after a short illness. She was 70 years old and lived in Oyster Bay Cove, L.I.         Mrs. Brock was formerly a trustee of the Green Vale School in Glen Head and chairman of the Women's Division of the Friends of the New York Philharmonic.         She was married in 1940 to Horace Brock, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a brother, Henry Wise Wood Distler of Tangier and London; two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Horace, of Menlo Park, Calif.; a daughter, Hope Brock Winthrop of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
        Nora Hodges, a teacher at the Dalton School for three decades and later a Peace Corps volunteer and staff member, died of heart failure Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Nora Hodges, a teacher at the Dalton School for three decades and later a Peace Corps volunteer and staff member, died of heart failure Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         A native of Vienna, she was the daughter of an industrialist and came to the United States in 1929. She married Charles Hodges, a New York University professor, and their rooftop loft on lower Fifth Avenue became a meeting place for New York intellectuals and artists in the 1930's and 40's.         From 1936 until 1965, she taught at Dalton, where she established a community-service program that became a widely copied model.         In 1966, after her husband's death, she taught English in Tunisia as a Peace Corps volunteer, then toured the United States to promote enlistment of the elderly in the corps.         She is survived by a daughter, April H. Herbert of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
        Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         As a professional partner of her husband, Charles, who died in 1978, Ray Eames collaborated in the design of hundreds of chairs, tables, and other pieces of furniture that combined mass production with a high sense of style and comfort.         Their most famous work is the ''Eames Chair,'' two pieces of molded plywood connected by stainless steel tubing. Other chairs and tables designed by the Eameses, who worked in Venice, Cal., were made from such materials as reinforced plastic and fiberglas.         Today, their designs are commonly found in airports, high schools and hospitals in mass-produced form, and as showpieces in the most stylish offices and homes. Their Home Was a Showcase         The Eameses' home in Santa Monica, Calif., was designed and built in 1949 as a demonstration project to encourage the use of mass-produced industrial materials. Virtually all of the materials used were bought out of manufacturers' catalogues. The house was a harbinger of the era of prefabricated buildings, but was also widely praised for the lightness, delicacy, intelligence and beauty of its design.         Mrs. Eames, a painter by training, and Mr. Eames, an architect, collaborated in dozens of design projects ranging from films and books to fabric design and museum exhibitions.         Their work in films was especially noted. Most of the films were educational, and many attempted to make scientific notions understandable to a wide public through striking visual means.         The best-known of these efforts is ''Powers of Ten,'' completed by the Eameses in 1968 for the Commission on College Physics. The film illustrates the concept of tenfold magnification by zooming a camera from the surface of the earth to the edge of the universe, then back down to a carbon atom in a man's hand.         A native of Sacramento, Calif., Mrs. Eames was trained as a painter, and studied with Hans Hoffman in New York City for six years in the 1930's. In 1940, she met Mr. Eames, an architect, at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. They married and moved to California in 1941.         Mrs. Eames is survived by her daughter, Lucia Demetrios of San Francisco, and by five grandchildren.       
        Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Dawn made her Broadway stage debut in March 1911 in an imported musical called ''The Pink Lady.'' The show was a hit, running for three years, and although she was not the leading lady Miss Dawn skyrocketed to fame.         She was once the mascot of both Army and Navy at one of their annual football games. And Miss Dawn said that when West Point's cadets tossed their hats onto the stage, one hat belonged to a cadet who later became President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career Began in London         Miss Dawn began her career in London musical comedies and appeared in ''The Dollar Princess'' and ''Dear Little Denmark,'' as well as ''The Pink Lady.'' In New York, Victor Herbert is said to have written ''The Debutant'' for her and she had roles in ''Up in Mabel's Room'' and ''The Demi-Virgin.'' Although she was an exceptional beauty, most of her roles were not starring ones.         Hazel Dawn was born in Ogden, Utah, and named Hazel Tout. Her family later moved to Wales, where her father, a Mormon, was a missionary. In London, according to one version of how she got her name, a producer, Ivan Caryll, met her at a party and said: ''You're just the one I want for my new play. But you must change your name. Tout is honest but impossible. You are so young, so fresh, so pink, you remind one of the dawn; you shall be Hazel Dawn.''         Miss Dawn starred in the original ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and appeared in early silent films of the Famous Players, among whom were Marion Davies and Margaret Clark. Married Into Wealth         In 1927, Miss Dawn married Charles Gruwell, a mining engineer from Montana, reportedly ''one of the richest men in the West,'' and largely gave up her career, though she did appear on stage in ''Wonder Boy'' in 1931. After Mr. Gruwell died in 1941, she went to work in the casting department of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, retiring from there about 25 years ago. She also appeared in 1946 in the film ''Margie.''         Miss Dawn is survived by her daughter, Dawn Gruwell Kaufman, and her son, Charles E. Gruwell, both of New York, five grandsons and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Leonor K. Sullivan, a 12-term Democratic member of the House of Representatives, the only woman ever elected to Congress from Missouri, died today of heart failure. She was 86 years old.         Leonor K. Sullivan, a 12-term Democratic member of the House of Representatives, the only woman ever elected to Congress from Missouri, died today of heart failure. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Sullivan died at St. Anthony's Medical Center, where she had been admitted Aug. 21, her 86th birthday, said a hospital spokesman, Bill Feustel. She had suffered from heart and respiratory problems in recent years.         Mrs. Sullivan, the former Leonor Kretzer, began her political career after she married Representative John B. Sullivan in 1941. For the next 10 years she aided him in his work serving the Third Congressional District, which includes southern St. Louis. Her husband died in 1951.         A year later, Mrs. Sullivan was elected to her husband's seat in the House. She held it until she stepped down in 1976. Mrs. Sullivan was succeeded by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, a Democrat who remains the Third District's Representative.         ''She was a distinguished and an effective legislator, much loved by the people of St. Louis,'' Mr. Gephardt said. 'Her contributions to our community and the nation will have long-lasting effects.''         In her years in Congress, Mrs. Sullivan became a prominent environmentalist and consumer advocate. She pressed for preservation of environmental resources and improved employment conditions, as well as consumer protection laws for foods, drugs and cosmetics. In 1954, she was an author of legislation creating the food-stamp program.         Mrs. Sullivan is survived by three sisters. Arrangments for her funeral were pending.       
        Dr. Myrtle Bryan McGraw, a psychologist and researcher in child development, died of pnuemonia last Tuesday at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 89 years old.         Dr. Myrtle Bryan McGraw, a psychologist and researcher in child development, died of pnuemonia last Tuesday at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 89 years old.         Dr. McGraw, whose work was hailed by Dr. John Dewey, the educator and philospher, conducted a behavior study with the Woods twins, Johnny and Jimmy, and others at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, where she was associate director of the Normal Child Development Center from 1930 to 1942. The study was published in 1935 and was followed by a second work, ''The Neuromuscular Maturation of the Human Infant,'' in 1943.         She was appointed professor of psychology at Briarcliff College in 1953 and taught there until 1972, when she retired.         Dr. McGraw was born in Birmingham, Ala., and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University. She received a Ph.D. from Columbia University.         She was married to Rudolph F. Malina, a research engineer, who died in 1970.         Dr. McGraw is survived by a daughter, Mitzi Wertheim of Washington, and two grandchildren.       
        Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Gerber played a key role in the introduction of Gerber baby food in 1928. Tired of straining foods for her own children, it occurred to her that if the Fremont Canning Company could puree tomatoes, it could also puree fruits and vegetables. Fremont was the predecessor to Gerber Products; the name was changed in 1941.         Her husband thought the idea was sound and that other mothers might welcome commercially strained baby foods if they could be sold cheaply at regular grocery outlets.         The first batches of strained vegetables were then produced. Mrs. Gerber, a native of Ithaca, Mich., who married Daniel Gerber in 1923, liked them and, more important, so did her 7-month-old daughter Sally. The new baby food was priced at 15 cents, considerably cheaper than similar foods, which until then had been obtainable largely through drug stores at 40 to 60 cents each.         Besides her daughter, Sally Phinny of Fremont, Mrs. Gerber is survived by four other children, Paula Warm of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Gay Cummings, Scottie Merrill and Daniel Gerber Jr., all of Fremont. She is also survived by 18 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.       
        Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Known to the dance world, including hundreds of students, as Geordie Graham, she was also the director of the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance from the 1940's through the 1960's. In the 1930's, she married Winthrop Sargeant, who became the music and dance critic of The New Yorker magazine. They were divorced in the 1940's and Miss Graham devoted herself full-time to her administative duties at the school.         The youngest of the three Graham sisters who were born in Allegheny, Pa., and who moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1908, Georgia followed Martha Graham into the Denishawn school in Los Angeles during World War I. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, considered among the founders of the modern-dance movement, enlisted the teaching talents of both Graham sisters before they recognized them as performers. A Star With Denishawn Troupe         Mr. Shawn nonetheless made Martha Graham a star in his Aztec ballet, ''Xochitl,'' only to see her leave the company in 1922. Georgia Graham, however, danced with the Denishawn Dancers until 1928, sometimes performing in the roles created by Miss St. Denis or her sister. The latter included ''Revolutionary Etude'' and the title role in 'Xochitl.'' According to a fellow Denishawn dancer, Jane Sherman, Georgia Graham stopped the show in that production.         She was a senior member of the Denishawn company on its widespread tour of Asia in 1925-26 and its transcontinental American tour in 1926-27. She also toured with the Denishawn troupe when it became part of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1928. Miss Graham was a dancer in 1931 in the early, all-female Martha Graham Dance Group. In 1933, she appeared in a theatrical production directed by Martha Graham, ''Six Miracle Plays.''         She is survived by her sister.       
        A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.         A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.         The Queen, an Egyptian, was married to the young Farouk in 1939. The wedding, carried out accordina to strict Islamic custom at the time, was held in her absence, though with great fanfare and pageantry. After the wedding, she was renamed Farida in accordance with the tradition that all members of the royal family have the same initial.         In 1948, Farouk divorced her after she had given birth to three daughters but failed to produce a male heir. The divorce aroused both great interest and antipathy in the West, both because of Farida's youth and beauty and because the King was regarded by many as the personification of a corrupt old order.         At the same time as Farida was divorced, King Farouk's sister, Queen Fawzia, described in the press as one of the world's most beautiful women, was divorced by the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.         In 1952, Farouk was deposed in a military coup led, among others, by then-Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser. He died in exile in Italy in 1965.         The former Queen lived most of her life in Paris with her three daughters. An artist, she returned to Cairo to live in 1974.       
        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Mary Elizabeth Tippett, an owner and breeder of such racing thoroughbreds as Mr. Gus, Tumbleweed, Pretense and Racing Room, died late Saturday after a long illness at Llangollen Farm, her 4,000-acre estate at Upperville, Va. She was 83 years old.         Mary Elizabeth Tippett, an owner and breeder of such racing thoroughbreds as Mr. Gus, Tumbleweed, Pretense and Racing Room, died late Saturday after a long illness at Llangollen Farm, her 4,000-acre estate at Upperville, Va. She was 83 years old.         Horses racing under her colors have won the Woodward, the English Grand National, the Santa Anita Handicap and many other major races. At one time she owned the second largest stable of thoroughbreds in North America.         She was born Mary Elizabeth Altemus in Wynnewood, Pa., where she attended school. When she was 15, her uncle, Samual D. Riddle, an internationally known turfman, presented her with her first horse.         She was most active in racing in the 1930's, during her marriage to John Hay Whitney. It ended in divorce in 1940. She was later married to Dr. E. Cooper Person, who died in the mid-1940's, and to Richard Dwight Lunn, from whom she was divorced.         Mrs. Tippett set a trend among thoroughbred owners when she had her helicopter and Rolls-Royce painted with her racing silks: dark purple and fuchsia. The helicopter was invariably piloted by her fourth husband, Col. Cloyce Joseph Tippett, of the Air Force. Colonel Tippett, who formerly headed the Lima, Peru, office of the International Civil Aviation Organization, is her only immediate survivor. A private service is to be held at Upperville Cemetery in Upperville, Va., today at 11 A.M.       
        Margerie Bonner Lowry, an actress and a writer, and the widow of the writer Malcolm Lowry, died in a Los Angeles nursing home last Wednesday. She was 83 years old.         Margerie Bonner Lowry, an actress and a writer, and the widow of the writer Malcolm Lowry, died in a Los Angeles nursing home last Wednesday. She was 83 years old.         Mrs. Lowry worked closely with her husband on his 1947 novel ''Under the Volcano,'' typing and editing the manuscript, and is generally considered to be the model for its central female character, the consul's wife, Yvonne.         Born in Washington, Mrs. Lowry acted in B movies starting in 1923 and was the co-star with her sister, Priscilla Bonner, in ''Paying the Price'' (1927). She wrote two mystery novels published in the late 1930's, ''The Shapes That Creep'' and ''The Last Twist of the Knife.''         She and Mr. Lowry married in 1940. After his death in 1957, she was the co-editor of his ''Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid'' (1968), and she edited his ''Psalms and Songs'' (1975) among other works.         Mrs. Lowry is survived by her sister.       
        Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Ruth Harris Bunche, a former teacher and the widow of Ralph J. Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Under Secretary General at the United Nations, died of pancreatic cancer yesterday at her home in Kew Gardens, Queens. She was 82 years old.         Mrs. Bunche was active in many civic and community organizations over the years. She served as a director on a number of boards, among them the New York City Youth Board, the Inwood House for Unwed Mothers, the Japan International Christian University and the advisory board of the Metropolitan Chapter of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. At her death, she was a board member of the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations, the Irving Berlin God Bless America Fund and the Play Schools Association, which honored her last year for 37 years of service.         Mrs. Bunche was a native of Montgomery, Ala., where her father had been a Republican national committeeman and an advocate of civil rights. She met her husband when she was a first-grade teacher at a school in Washington, where Mr. Bunche was a political science professor at Howard University. They were married in 1930; he died in 1971.         She is survived by a daughter, Joan, of Manhattan; a son, Ralph Jr., of London; a sister, Aileen Davis of Washington; a brother, Booker Harris of Hartford, and six grandchildren.         A service will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 1076 Madison Avenue on Tuesday at 1 P.M.       
        Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.         Baroness Lee of Asheridge, as she was known after being made a life peer in 1970, held a seat in Parliament for 27 years. She was a member of the Labor Party's national executive from 1958 to 1970 and served as party chairman in 1967 and 1968.         The present leader of the party, Neil Kinnock, on Thursday recalled her as ''a woman of brilliance and vision, a great socialist, who inspired so many and was loved by all who knew her warmth and passion for justice.''         Given special responsibility for the arts in 1965 by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, she played a crucial political role in starting the Open University, which provided higher education by correspondence, over radio and television and at evening classes to many students who had had no other university-level studies. Lesson for a Teacher         Her lifelong concern for the underprivileged was sharpened by her experience while teaching for two years in the late 1920's in a village near Lochgelly in Fifeshire, eastern Scotland.         ''I did not believe that there was any good reason why either the children or myself should come to terms with life as we found it in that bleak mining village,'' she wrote in her volume of memoirs ''This Great Journey.''         ''Most of the misery I saw around me in school, in the streets, and in private homes, had its roots in the poverty of the place,'' she said. ''I did not see how, within the four walls of a classroom, I could ever hope to change any of that.''         She ran successfully for Parliament and represented a Scottish district from 1929 until she lost the seat in 1931. She represented another district, near the industrial city of Birmingham in England, from 1945 until losing that seat in a general election in 1970. She then automatically acquired a seat in the House of Lords on being elevated to the peerage.         A New York Times editorial commented at the time: ''How Scotland's fiery Jennie would have scorned the robes of a baroness early in her Labor Party career!'' Married to Bevan         She was born Janet Lee on Nov. 3, 1904 in Lochgelly. Her father, James Lee, was active in the trade union movement. Her paternal grandfather, Michael Lee, won renown in the movement, rising to be a member of the Scottish Miners' Executive.         Lady Lee was married in 1934 to Aneurin Bevan, a prominent Labor Party figure who was known as Nye. A former coal miner, he was a elected to Parliament in 1929 and remained a Member of Parliament for 31 years, serving as Minister of Health from 1945 to 1951. He died in 1960.         After Jennie Lee was elected to Parliament from Staffordshire in 1945, and Mr. Bevan was re-elected to Parliament in the same elections, they became known as ''Britain's first man-and-wife parliamentary team.''         Lady Lee, who held degrees from the University of Edinburgh, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Cambridge University. Her books included ''My Life with Nye,'' published in 1980, in addition to ''This Great Journey,'' which was published in the United States in 1942 after appearing first in Britain.         Lady Lee and Mr. Bevan had no children, and she has no survivors.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         The reports said Ms. Onassis had been staying with childhood friends at an exclusive country club outside the Argentine capital. Her father, Aristotle Onassis, laid the foundation of his self-made fortune in shipping, real estate and high finance in Argentina and was a dual citizen of that country and Greece.         Mr. Onassis died in 1975 in France and his daughter and only surviving child was left in charge of the Onassis Group, with assets then variously estimated at $500 million to $1 billion, most of it in shipping. Forbes magazine, citing a worldwide slump in that industry, reported in 1987 that the figure probably had shrunk to $250 million or less.         Mr. Onassis' two major shipping companies were Springfield Shipping of New York City and Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Onassis gave up her American citizenship. She learned about business and finance in the New York offices of her father, beginning as a 20-year-old secretary. After his death, she gradually strengthened her hold over the Onassis Group, although some questions remained in the late 1970's as to just how much control she exerted and how much she left to day-to-day managers.         One of the world's richest women, Miss Onassis was no stranger to personal misfortune. There was the death of her only brother, Alexander, in a private-plane crash in 1973. She herself went through four much-publicized marriages and divorces. Churchill and Callas         The social life on ''Ari'' Onassis' 325-foot yacht, named Christina, was legendary and included the likes of Winston Churchill and the soprano Maria Callas. In fact, Mr. Onassis was romantically linked with Miss Callas when his own marriage to the former Athina (Tina) Livanos, another shipping heiress, broke up in 1959.         Tina Onassis eventually was remarried to her former husband's arch rival, Stavros Niarchos. And Ari Onassis, in 1968, married Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of President John F. Kennedy, whom he first met in 1963.         Christina Onassis defied her father in 1971 by marrying Joseph Bolker, a millionaire home builder and real-estate man, A divorced father of four, he was 27 years her senior and the union broke up within months, apparently at the insistence of her father.         Her next marriage, strongly promoted by her father, took place shortly after his death. Her second husband was Alexander Andreadis, a Greek shipping and banking heir. It, too, lasted only 14 months.         Miss Onassis' third marriage, in Moscow in 1978 to Sergei Kauzov, a Soviet shipping agent, again made front-page headlines, as did her flight to Greece a few days later and their separation in 1979. Marries Frenchman         She married a French businessman, Thierry Roussel, in 1984 and had a daughter with him, Athina, the following January. They filed for divorce eight months later.         Ms. Onassis was said to have never felt close to her stepmother. Friends in Athens said Mr. Onassis was thinking of divorcing the former Mrs. Kennedy at the time of his death and had intended to limit a divorce settlement to $3 million rather than the $250,000 a year provided in his will.         The reports of a forthcoming divorce were denied by Christina, who in 1977 was said to have made a much more generous multi-million settlement in return for which Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dropped all further claims against the estate.       
        Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Mrs. Gottlieb was the founder and president of the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, set up in 1976 according to provisions in her husband's will to assist older artists in need. The foundation, with assets of some $6 million derived from the sale of Mr. Gottlieb's works, gives 10 grants a year and maintains an emergency assistance program. The foundation will continue, its director, Sanford Hirsch, said.         Mrs. Gottlieb was born in Danbury, Conn., on April 15, 1907. She came to New York in 1924, studied art at Pratt Institute and became a painter, working in the garment industry to support herself. In 1932 she married Mr. Gottlieb, and began teaching tailoring skills at the Cental Needle Trades High School - now Fashion Industries High School. She supported her husband financially, eventually giving up her own painting to work as his studio assistant. She retired in 1960. Mr. Gottlieb died in 1974.         Mrs. Gottlieb is survived by two sisters, Frances Dick and Gladys Sikora, both of New York City, and six nieces and nephews.         A funeral service will be held today at 10:30 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.       
        Alice Boney, a prominent dealer in Oriental art, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 87 years old.         Alice Boney, a prominent dealer in Oriental art, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 87 years old.         Miss Boney was self-taught, yet rose to become an adviser on Chinese and Japanese art to collectors and museums. ''The doyenne of Oriental art,'' a Hong Kong magazine, Orientations, called her in an article to appear later this month.         ''In the 65 years of her career, she did what few women in the world dared to do,'' the article said. ''She entered the male-dominated world of Oriental art and she prospered.''         Born in Philadelphia, Miss Boney inherited a trust fund from her grandfather. She moved to New York, where she met Ian Kleykamp, a Dutch art dealer. They married and opened a gallery on Fifth Avenue.         They brought a shipload of Chinese tomb sculptures from the Tang Dynasty (618 to 906 A.D.) to New York and mounted an exhibition of the art. In 1926, they exhibited contemporary Japanese paintings, then rarely seen in the United States. Helped Build Hoover's Collection         During the Depression, the gallery closed and Miss Boney divorced. She went into business for herself, selling art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Freer Gallery in Washington.         Miss Boney was instrumental in building President Herbert H. Hoover's porcelain collection of Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644 A.D.) and Manchu Dynasty (1644 to 1912 A.D.) objects.         During the 1940's and 1950's, she helped to organize exhibitions of art and furniture at the China Institute and elsewhere. ''She introduced leading Japanese artists and potters to America,'' said Amy Poster, the acting director of the Asian art department at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1958 Miss Boney went to Japan for six months and stayed for 16 years, returning annually to the United States to sell art.         ''She was the preeminent dealer in her field of Asian art and particularly Japanese art,'' Ms. Poster noted. ''She taught a younger generation of dealers, collectors and museum professionals a great deal about an esthetic that she understood very well.''         When Miss Boney returned to New York in 1974, she worked from her Park Avenue apartment. She greeted visitors dressed in a green silk robe and matching antique jade jewelry. The robe, a Japanese yukata, which is less formal than a kimono, was given to her by a sumo wrestler.         There are no survivors.       
        Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove.         Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove. In 1949, her design for a black-and-white French provincial bedroom accented with pumpkin-colored furniture became one of the most photographed interiors in magazines and books.         ''She was a great inspiration when I was a student in the 50's,'' said Mario Buatta, an interior designer in Manhattan. ''I remember rooms in pink and orange. It was very distinctive. Her work had guts.''         Miss Kahane (pronounced ka-HAIN) was born in Manhattan. She graduated from the Parsons School of Design and worked as an illustrator of women's clothing. In 1939, she went into business as an interior designer. 'The Ability to Visualize'         She designed light bulbs, hotels, studio apartments and theaters. A client, Anne Windfohr Marion, is the second generation of her family to be a client. ''She did mother's house when I was 15,'' said Mrs. Marion, whose husband, John, is chairman of Sotheby's North America. ''She was very easy to work with, a vital, energetic person.''         Miss Kahane had the ability to charm clients while sticking firmly to her finely honed esthetic of glamour and tasteful pizzazz. ''The decorator has the ability to visualize a finished room before it is begun,'' she said, ''and the strength of character not to deviate from a plan, no matter what the opinion of loving friends and relatives.''         After she married, Miss Kahane transformed her dining room into a library for Mr. Grauer's book collection. Then she moved the dining table back in, creating another much-photographed interior. The couple appeared together on an NBC Radio program, ''Decorating Wavelengths,'' which offered news and advice.         Miss Kahane produced a television documentary on contemporary Scandinavian design. She was on the design committee for the United States Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. In 1959, Miss Kahane traveled to the Soviet Union for NBC to record women's views. Under the aegis of the State Department, she conducted symposiums on textiles in Southeast Asian countries. Book for Children         Miss Kahane was a fellow and former treasurer of the American Institute of Interior Designers, a former president of the Decorators Club and an honorary life member of the American Society of Interior Designers.         She wrote a book for children, ''There's a Decorator in Your Doll House,'' published by Atheneum in 1968. In 1985, she was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame.         Miss Kahane had a wit that was often as sharp as her clothing. In an interview in which she revealed that much of the art in her home had been bought by her husband without consultation, she observed, ''When a man's wife is a decorator, he frequently gets the compulsion to assert himself.''         Her recipe for a happy marriage included two sinks in the bathroom. ''A great meeting place,'' she noted.         Surviving are her daughter, Joan Ebenstein Porter of Pipersville, Pa., and two grandchildren. A memorial will be held Jan. 19 at 10:30 A.M. at the David M. Schwartz Center at Parsons, 560 Seventh Avenue at 40th Street.

Dorothy de Rothschild, a philanthropist, died Saturday at her home in London after a brief illness. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. de Rothschild and her husband, James A. de Rothschild, were longtime supporters of Israel, active in pressing the British Government for what became known as the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 commitment to work toward a Jewish homeland in British-administered Palestine.         When Mr. de Rothschild died in 1957, he bequeathed to Israel the money for a new building for the national Parliament, which Mrs. de Rothschild dedicated in 1966. Toward the end of her life she gave Israel a new Supreme Court building.         Born Dorothy Pinto in London, she married Mr. de Rothschild in 1912.         After her husband's death, their home at Waddesdon Manor, a 6,000-acre estate in Buckinghamshire, was left to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, along with a considerable art collection. Mrs. de Rothschild continued to be associated with the manor, working for its improvement and upkeep.         In recent years she divided her time between her home in London and Eythrope, her country estate near Waddesdon Manor.         There are no immediate survivors.
