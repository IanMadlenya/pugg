A memorial service will be held at 10 A.M. Monday in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan for the Rev. Mother Ruth, founder and headmistress of St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's Episcopal day school. The Reverend Mother, who died Dec. 22 after a brief illness, was 89 years old.         The Reverend Mother, a native New Yorker, was born Ruth Elaine Younger. She entered the Canadian Sisterhood of St. John the Divine in Toronto and took her final vows in 1922. She was a graduate of St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto, and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education from Columbia University.         She and a colleague, Sister Edith Margaret, founded St. Hilda's School in Morningside Heights in 1950. It later became St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School, which offered coeducational academic training from nursery through the 12th grade. She was its headmistress until her retirement in 1985.         In 1952, she was elected the Reverend Mother of the Community of the Holy Spirit, an Episcopal religious order for women that she founded that year. Under her direction, the group also founded the Melrose School in Brewster, N.Y., and St. Cuthbert's Retreat House.

        A daughter of former New Jersey Gov. William T. Cahill was found dead in her apartment here after drowning in a bathtub, the woman's family and law-enforcement authorities said Friday.         A daughter of former New Jersey Gov. William T. Cahill was found dead in her apartment here after drowning in a bathtub, the woman's family and law-enforcement authorities said Friday.         The victim, Patricia Cahill, 34 years old, who had suffered seizures since being critically injured in a traffic accident in 1969, had failed to show up Wednesday for her job as an I.B.M. sales representative, said her brother, William T. Cahill Jr. Her body was then found by a relative, Mr. Cahill said.         ''We don't know if there was a seizure or a fall that led to her drowning in the bathroom,'' he said.         The Camden County Medical Examiner's office, after an autopsy Wednesday, determined the death was caused by accidental drowning.         Miss Cahill is survived by her father, who was Governor from 1970 to 1974, and mother, Elizabeth, of Haddonfield; two brothers, John and William T. Jr., both of Collingswood; and five sisters, Kathleen Tully of Haddonfield, Mary Cahill of Washington, Regina Keeley of Potomac, Md., Eileen Campbell of Merchantville and Teresa Cahill of Boston.       
        Irene Handl, one of Britain's best-loved actresses and comediennes, who perfected the role of a slightly eccentric cockney old lady, died today at her home here, according to her agent, Peter Graham. She was 85 years old.         Irene Handl, one of Britain's best-loved actresses and comediennes, who perfected the role of a slightly eccentric cockney old lady, died today at her home here, according to her agent, Peter Graham. She was 85 years old.         Born in London the daughter of a Viennese father and a French mother, Miss Handl took up acting when she was 36 and over the years appeared in stage plays, films and television comedies as well as becoming an accomplished writer.         Her films included ''Doctor in Love,'' ''The French Mistress'' and ''The Belles of St. Trinians.''         She became well-known in Britain for appearances in television shows including ''Hancock's Half Hour,'' ''You Must Be Joking,'' ''For the Love of Ada'' and, most recently, ''Never Say Die.''         She continued working as a television actress until her death.       
        Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Miss Yourcenar was a cosmopolitan, versatile woman of letters who wrote in her native French. To English-speaking readers, she was best known for her fiction, especially her 1951 novel ''Memoirs of Hadrian.'' Her other writings included essays, memoirs and plays.         On hearing of her death, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France said yesterday in Paris: ''French letters has just lost an exceptional woman. On the strength of a classical and rigorous style, Marguerite Yourcenar used a very personal tone to find, thanks to history, the occasion for a strong reflection on morality and power.'' 'Words Will Be Read Forever'         Roger W. Straus, the president and chief executive officer of Farrar Straus & Giroux, which has published works by Miss Yourcenar, said yesterday in a statement released at the Manhattan headquarters of the publishing house: ''Marguerite Yourcenar was without question or doubt one of the great writers of the 20th century. She is a great loss to the literary community, but her words will be read and remembered forever.''         Born in Brussels of a French father and Belgian mother, Miss Yourcenar grew up in France and traveled widely. On a visit to the United States early in World War II, she decided to stay when, as she once put it, ''the months stretched into years as the war didn't end.'' For the next decade she taught comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College. She acquired United States citizenship in 1947 but was later reinstated as a citizen of France.         ''I am rootless,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To steal from Hadrian, 'I am at home everywhere and nowhere.' ''         Her induction into the Academie Francaise in 1981 was an accolade that had been denied to Mme. de Stael, Colette and other illustrious Frenchwomen in the four-century history of that prestigious society of 40 ''immortals,'' the arbiters of French language and literature. 'Let Their Shadows Pass'         Commenting on her induction, Miss Yourcenar said: ''This uncertain, floating me, whose existence I myself dispute, here it is, surrounded, accompanied by an invisible troupe of women who perhaps should have received this honor long before, so that I am tempted to stand aside to let their shadows pass.''         She also said the academy was not to blame for not admitting women sooner. ''One cannot say,'' she said, ''that in French society, so impregnated with feminine influences, the academy has been a notable misogynist: it simply conformed to the custom that willingly placed a woman on a pedestal but did not permit itself to officially offer her a chair.''         Miss Yourcenar was respected as a classical scholar as well as a literary stylist. The Oxford University classicist Hugh Lloyd-Jones, writing in The New York Times Book Review in February 1985, praised her ''ornamental and melliflous French prose, studded with the literary allusions which come so easily to such a cultivated writer.'' Mixing Scholarship and Magic         Miss Yourcenar once said her writing had ''one foot in scholarship, the other in magic arts,'' and her interests were diverse.         Shortly before her death, in an interview with Jean-Pierre Corteggiani for the new quarterly Normal, Miss Yourcenar spoke of her views on literature:         ''The books I like best are those where there is intelligence, goodness and no injustice. They are very rare indeed. I think that the reason there is so much bad literature, or at least one of the reasons, is that the average person who sets out to be a writer goes around looking for subjects to write about, and editors have the effrontery to ask you: 'Could you not possibly write a novel about . . . or an essay on . . .,' to which I always reply that I never write anything I have not chosen myself.''         Her works ranged from ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' - an imaginary autobiography of the Roman emperor written as a letter to his grandson Marcus Aurelius - to a volume of stories, ''Oriental Tales'' (first published in 1938 in French), that drew on the folklore of medieval Japan and other cultures. Translated American Spirituals         She also wrote plays, poems and prose poems and translated into French the lyrics of American spirituals as well as works by such authors as James Baldwin, the modern Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, Henry James, Thomas Mann, Yukio Mishima and Virginia Woolf.         The Hadrian novel was widely considered Miss Yourcenar's magnum opus. The author Stephen Koch wrote in The Times Book Review in September 1985 that the work ''has riches for anyone interested in history, humanism or the psychology of power.'' When it was first published, he recalled, ''it was immediately incrusted with the mixed and marmoreal honor of being called a classic in its own time.''         Miss Yourcenar's criticism was praised by John Gross in The Times. Reviewing the English translation of her book ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi and Other Essays,'' Mr. Gross called her ''an outstanding critic'' and said the essays in the book were notably lucid and ''forceful, deeply pondered, the record of a full imaginative response.''         The rest of her work, which drew on her familiarity with several languages and literatures, remained less widely known until she was named to the Academie Francaise. In subsequent years, translations of her writing came out more frequently. Translations Are Published         In April, ''Two Lives and a Dream,'' a volume containing three stories by Miss Yourcenar, was published in an English translation by Walter Kaiser in collaboraton with the author.         The book had come out in 1982 in France, and the stories it contained were revisions of writing Miss Yourcenar did decades earlier. Farrar Straus & Giroux is to publish a paperback edition in April.         ''Mishima: a Vision of the Void,'' a short study by Miss Yourcenar of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, was published here in 1986.         Farrar Straus is also scheduled to publish a collection of essays and literary criticism next spring titled ''That Mighty Sculptor, Time.'' In addition, Farrar Straus is to publish three volumes of autobiography by Ms. Yourcenar, but no publication dates have been set.         The other books by Miss Yourcenar that have appeared in the United States in English translation include, in addition to ''Memoirs of Hadrian,'' ''Coup de Grace'' (1957), ''The Abyss'' (1976), ''Fires'' (1981), ''A Coin in Nine Hands'' (1982), ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi'' (1984), ''Alexis'' (1984) and ''Oriental Tales'' (1985). Read Racine at 8         Miss Yourcenar was born June 8, 1903, the only child of Michel de Crayencour and the former Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne. The name Yourcenar - which she assumed personally and professionally in the 1920's - is an imperfect anagram of the name Crayencour.         Her mother died when Marguerite was less than a month old, and she was educated, largely by tutors, under the direction of her father. As an 8-year-old, she was already reading the work of the 17th-century French dramatist Racine, and as a teen-ager she had two small books of verse published.         Then, as an independently wealthy young woman, she traveled widely, wrote essays, poems and fiction, and won praise as a novelist. In 1950, after settling in the United States, Miss Yourcenar and her American friend and companion, Grace Frick, bought the house in Northeast Harbor - on Mount Desert Island off the Maine coast -that became their longtime home. Miss Frick, who translated ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' and other works by Miss Yourcenar into English, died in 1979.         Miss Yourcenar was known to have prepared a tombstone for her eventual grave, complete up to the final two digits of the date of her death. In the interview with Normal, Miss Yourcenar said she had met a Frenchwoman who was horrified that she had even put the first two numbers of her death date on the marker. ''So she said 'but why should you not live to the year 2000?' I have absolutely no desire to live till the year 2000,'' Miss Yourcenar said. ''The year 2000 is not for me.''         Miss Yourcenar was awarded honorary degrees by Smith, Bowdoin and Colby colleges. She also won numerous European literary prizes, was decorated by the French and Belgian Governments and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the Academy of the French Language and Literature of Belgium.         There are no known survivors.       
        Ruth G. Bonner, mother-in-law of the Soviet physicist Andrei D. Sakharov and a victim of Stalin's purges in the late 1930's, died Friday at the age of 87, her daughter Yelena G. Bonner said today.         Ruth G. Bonner, mother-in-law of the Soviet physicist Andrei D. Sakharov and a victim of Stalin's purges in the late 1930's, died Friday at the age of 87, her daughter Yelena G. Bonner said today.         She said her mother died of a brain hemorrhage in her sleep after a long illness.         Ruth Bonner was an official of the Moscow City Communist Party committee when she was arrested in 1937, and she spent the next 17 years in labor camp or in exile.         Her husband, Georg Alikhanov, then personnel director of Comintern, the Communist International, had been arrested a few days earlier in a mass purge of senior officials of the organization. Like many Comintern colleagues, he was accused of espionage for foreign countries and executed.         Yelena Bonner said her mother, who was among the first of Stalin's victims to be rehabilitated by Khrushchev, was never able to work again after her release in 1954.         Mr. Alikhanov was rehabilitated posthumously.         When Mr. Sakharov and his wife were sent into internal exile to the Volga city of Gorky in 1980 because of their human rights activities, Ruth Bonner was allowed to go to the United States to live with her grandchildren, who had emigrated in the 1970's.         She returned to live with the Sakharovs last June, six months after the Sakharovs were allowed to return to Moscow.         Yelena Bonner said she hoped her son, Alexei, and her daughter, Tatyana, would be granted visas to attend the funeral, which she said would probably be held Tuesday.       
        Elizabeth Martin Sanford, mother of Senator Terry Sanford of North Carolina, died Saturday after a heart attack she suffered in a holiday visit to her son's home. She was 99.         Elizabeth Martin Sanford, mother of Senator Terry Sanford of North Carolina, died Saturday after a heart attack she suffered in a holiday visit to her son's home. She was 99.         Mrs. Sanford was born in Salem, Va., on Nov. 30, 1888. She taught in the public schools of Laurinburg, Va., for more than 40 years.         Survivors include three other children, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
        Bland Symington Montenecourt, a professor of microbiology and a researcher in biotechnology, died of cancer Dec. 19 at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pa. She was 45 years old and lived in Bloomsbury, N.J.         Bland Symington Montenecourt, a professor of microbiology and a researcher in biotechnology, died of cancer Dec. 19 at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pa. She was 45 years old and lived in Bloomsbury, N.J.         She graduated from Rosemount College in Rosemount, Pa., and earned a doctorate from the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University.         She is survived by her husband, Gene; two sons, Mark and Ned, and a daughter, Dorsey, all of Bloomsbury; her mother, Katherine Symington, and two sisters, Lee Mathews and Kathy Seiler, all of Baltimore.       
        Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and teacher who was the wife and assistant of Alfred H. Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The diversity of Mrs. Barr's talents and the force of her personality made her a presence in the New York art world for half a century.         She was the author of ''Medardo Rosso (1858-1928),'' a monograph on the Italian modernist sculptor that was published by the Museum of Modern Art in 1963.         She taught art history for 37 years at the Spence School, where she inspired many future scholars, including Joan R. Mertens, curator of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan Museum.         Mrs. Barr was fluent in French, Italian, Spanish and German and was crucially involved in her husband's curatorial activities and in the wartime effort to provide refuge in the United States for European artists. 'An Essential Partner'         ''Marga was a remarkable person who was an essential partner in the achievements and legacy of Alfred Barr,'' said Richard E. Oldenburg, the director of the Modern. ''A gifted art historian with a fine sense of quality, she was also very intelligent, strong-willed and intensely honest about everything and everyone, including herself.''         ''The book on Rosso is still the best work on him in English,'' said Hilton Kramer, the editor of The New Criterion, whose issue last summer, ''Our Campaigns,'' was devoted to Mrs. Barr's biographical chronicle of the years 1930 to 1944, the turbulent period when Mr. Barr helped shape the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Barr died in 1981 at the age of 79.         ''She was a very gifted linguist, and Alfred was not,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''So all of his dealings with Picasso, Matisse, Miro and virtually all non-English-speaking European artists were done with her as the interpreter. Neither of his two most important books, on Picasso and Matisse, could have been possible without her.''         Mr. Barr's monograph ''Picasso: Fifty Years of His Art,'' published in 1946, was dedicated to her.         ''I grew up in awe of Alfred and Margaret,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose father, Rene d'Harnoncourt, was director of the Museum of Modern Art from 1949 to 1968. ''I think the remarkable thing about Margaret was her emphasis. She made everyone else, including me, feel fuzzy and vague. She had a real gift for drawing your attention and not letting it go.'' Born in Rome         Margaret Scolari was born in Rome in 1901. Her mother, Mary Fitzmaurice, was Irish. Her father, Virgilio Scolari, was an Italian antiques dealer. At the University of Rome from 1919 to 1922, she specialized in humanistic and linguistic studies.         She came to the United States in 1925 and taught Italian at Vassar, from which she also received a master's degree in art history.         In September 1929 she moved to New York City, where she studied art history at New York University. Late in the year, at the inaugural exhibition of the Museum of Modern Art, she met Alfred Barr.         They were married in Paris in 1930. In a profile on Alfred Barr in The New Yorker in 1953, Dwight Macdonald wrote: ''The day after the wedding, Barr started out to borrow pictures for a forthcoming Corot-Daumier show, with Mrs. Barr acting as his translator and secretary. They continued the arrangement through the thirties, going abroad almost every summer to beg and borrow pictures for the next year's exhibitions.''         During World War II, Mrs. Barr was involved in the Emergency Rescue Committee (now the International Rescue Committee), which was responsible for helping artists like Jacques Lipchitz, Piet Mondrian, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Andre Masson to leave Europe. Translations and Chronology         Mrs. Barr translated Charles Rufus Morey's catalogue of the Vatican Library's Museo Christiano into Italian. She also made the first complete English translation of Matisse's ''Notes of a Painter.''         At the time of her death she was working on the chronology of her life with her husband.         In the introduction to her art history course at Spence, where she taught from 1943 to 1980, Mrs. Barr wrote:         ''I spend no time defining what is art, you'll soon know. Not all of it is, at first sight, beautiful; little of it is pretty; all of it is interesting. And the more you know about a work of art - what preceded it, what followed it, the reasons why it is the way it is - the more it will come to life for you. The tourist who goes through museums exclaiming, 'Beautiful, Beautiful,' is something to be deplored. You jolly well must know why.         ''Now plan to enjoy yourselves. As Poussin, the great French painter of the 17th century, remarked, 'Le fin de l'art est la delectation,' '' - ''The goal of art is delight.''         Mrs. Barr is survived by a daughter, Victoria, a painter who lives in New York City.         A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. on Jan. 12 at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, 921 Madison Avenue, at 73d Street.       
        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.         Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.         In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.         She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.         Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.         Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.         Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.       
        Joy Simpson, an American soprano, died early today after suffering a brain hemorrhage during a performance last week, a hospital spokeswoman said. Ms. Simpson was 40 years old.  The soprano, who was from Philadelphia, went into a coma Saturday and never recovered, the spokeswoman said.         Joy Simpson, an American soprano, died early today after suffering a brain hemorrhage during a performance last week, a hospital spokeswoman said. Ms. Simpson was 40 years old.  The soprano, who was from Philadelphia, went into a coma Saturday and never recovered, the spokeswoman said.         Ms. Simpson was on a three-week tour of South Africa in defiance of the United Nations cultural boycott against the country. The soprano, who is black, said she came to South Africa to bring ''a message of love and to spread goodwill.''         She was performing a spiritual, ''Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,'' at Cape Town's City Hall Thursday night when she collapsed. Doctors from the audience came to her aid, and she was taken to the hospital.         Ms. Simpson came from a singing family. Her mother and father, and her five sisters and two brothers have been singing for many years as the Simpson Family Singers.         She performed with Opera North in Philadelphia and with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. She had toured many countries, including the Soviet Union.

        Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         The authorities said they believed her fall from the eighth floor of the 212-foot tower was a suicide.         Mrs. Power, an activist for women's rights and world peace, had been a member of the University of Michigan Board of Regents since 1974.         Her husband, Philip, is chairman of the Surburban Communications Corporation in Livonia, Mich., the publisher of 50 newspapers in the Detroit and Cincinnati areas. His family gave $3.9 million to build the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the Ann Arbor campus.         The university's president, Harold T. Shapiro, said yesterday that Mrs. Power's death was ''a great loss for the university, for the state and for those committed to more progressive social policy.'' Michigan's Governor, James J. Blanchard, called her a ''brilliant and vibrant caring person committed to women's rights and equality.''         From 1966 to 1969, Mrs. Power was executive director of the New York City Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay. She also was executive assistant on Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's personal staff from 1959 to 1963.         She was born in Detroit and was graduated from Vassar College. She also received a diploma in French at the Alliance Francaise in Paris and a master's degree in politics and international relations from New York University in 1965.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Power is survived by a son, Nathan E., at home; her mother, Katharine R. Goddard, of Ann Arbor; a sister, Margery G. Whiteman, of Albany, and two brothers, Russel H. Goddard, of New Haven, and Wendell H. Goddard, of Berkeley, Calif.         Correction:  March 28, 1987, Saturday, Late City Final Edition       
        Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Miss Greenwood's son, Jason Morrell, said his mother was found dead Saturday by friends she had invited to dinner. Mr. Morrell did not give a cause of his mother's death, but a BBC news report said she had apparently suffered a heart attack.         Miss Greenwood appeared on stage only two weeks ago in a sketch with Robert Morley at the Prince of Wales Theater in London. Mr. Morrell said his mother had not been ill recently.         Known primarily as a comic actress, Miss Greenwood starred in a series of British films in the 1940's and 50's that are now considered classics.         One of her frequent co-stars was Sir Alec Guinness, with whom she made ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' ''The Man in the White Suit'' and ''The Detective,'' a movie based on G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown books. In Film Version of 'Ernest'         Miss Greenwood also appeared with Michael Redgrave in the film version of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Ernest'' and with Basil Rathbone in ''Tight Little Island,'' a screen adaptation of Compton Mackenzie's novel ''Whiskey Galore.''         Miss Greenwood, born in the Chelsea section of London on March 4, 1921, was the daughter of Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood, an artist. She began taking dancing lessons when she was 8 years old, studied at St. Catherine's School in Surrey, and continued to take ballet lessons until she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at 17.         Her first stage appearance came at age 18 when she appeared as Louisa in Moliere's ''Malade Imaginaire'' at the Apollo Theater in London. Performances in ''Little Ladyship'' and ''The Women'' followed.         Leslie Howard saw her in ''The Women'' and made Miss Greenwood his leading lady in the film ''The Gentle Sex.'' From then on Miss Greenwood alternated film and stage work.         She appeared in the role of Wendy in ''Peter Pan'' and as Elie Dunn in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House,'' then undertook more serious roles, playing Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' with the Donald Wolfit company, Nora in Ibsen's ''Doll House,'' Celia in ''Volpone'' and Sabina in ''The Young Wives' Tale.'' Developed a Following         Her film career rocketed with the success of ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' and Miss Greenwood gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. She appeared on Broadway with Claude Rains in 1953 in T. S. Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.''         Miss Greenwood's career had recently revived with appearances in several British television series. Her son said yesterday: ''She enjoyed doing all the recent TV work. She kept a trueness to herself. If she didn't want to do something, she wouldn't do it.''         Miss Greenwood was married in 1960 to the actor Andre Morrell, who died in 1978. She is survived by her son.         Correction:  March 19, 1987, Thursday, Late City Final Edition       
        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.

        Margaret Israel, an artist whose mixed-media constructions and collages were highly praised for combining the fancy and innocence of folk art with a modern sophistication, was killed Wednesday in Manhattan in an accident while riding her bicycle. She was 57 years old.         Margaret Israel, an artist whose mixed-media constructions and collages were highly praised for combining the fancy and innocence of folk art with a modern sophistication, was killed Wednesday in Manhattan in an accident while riding her bicycle. She was 57 years old.         The artist died instantly when her bicycle collided with a tractor-trailer on West 23d Street at the intersection of 11th Avenue.         Mrs. Israel, working in a studio cluttered with bowls, boats, masks, and other curios and bits of city flotsam, produced drawings, paintings, terra-cotta figures, bamboo constructions and multimedia works of excellent craftmanship and poetic delicacy.         She first showed in New York at the Egan Gallery in 1961, and had regular shows throughout the 70's and 80's at the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery on Madison Avenue.         ''She works on a bold scale, filling whole rooms with the objects of her imagination,'' Hilton Kramer wrote in The New York Times in 1978. Studied in Paris         A native of Cuba, Mrs. Israel came to the United States as an infant. She attended Syracuse University in Syracuse, N.Y., and later studied art at several institutions in Paris, including the Ecole des Beaux Arts, the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere and Atelier 17.         In an interview with The New York Times in 1979, Mrs. Israel said: ''My work is decorative, in the sense that I intend it to reach you very quickly, on a level of pure enjoyment. And I use familiar themes because it's an easy way to communicate with people. I think of it all as a journey where the adventure lies in seeing how one thing works with another.''         To collectors, friends and associates in the art world, Mrs. Israel was known for an energy, an enthusiasm and an iconoclasm that matched her art.         Mrs. Israel's husband, Marvin, died in 1984. She is survived by her mother, Margaret Ponce, and a sister.       
        Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         In a 25-year career with The Times, Miss Curtis, as a reporter and as an editor, helped transform the coverage of fashion and society news, supervised the daily page of opinion opposite the editorial page and for the last four years wrote a weekly column of social commentary.         Her column, a blend of reporting and observation that appeared each Tuesday, was discontinued last June, when Miss Curtis became ill and went to Columbus for medical treatment. Her husband, Dr. William E. Hunt, is professor and director of the division of neurologic surgery at the College of Medicine at Ohio State University.         ''Charlotte Curtis, who graced this newspaper for over 25 years, was a warm and considerate friend who could write with a rapier and who, as an editor, was eternally curious and questioning,'' Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, said yesterday. ''As a person and as a superb journalist, she will be missed and mourned.'' Expanded Coverage         As editor of women's and family/ style news from 1965 to 1974, Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received.         Under her direction, reporting on the renascent feminist movement and on controversial issues such as abortion replaced the features on good grooming and shopping that had traditionally appeared on women's news pages.         As an associate editor of The Times in charge of the Op-Ed page from 1974 to 1982, she brought an eclectic approach to a broad range of commentary and analysis on major social, economic and political issues of the day. In that post, she was the first woman to have her name listed on the masthead of The New York Times among its senior editors.         But it was as a society news reporter in the 1960's, chronicling the life styles of the rich and powerful, that Miss Curtis became one of the nation's best-known journalists and set a pattern followed by other writers. Other publications heralded her iconoclastic style, the precision of her technique and the research behind it. ''The Times' girl on the beat studies her subjects with the detachment of a professional sociologist,'' Time magazine reported in February 1965. An Incisive Wit         A strong-willed, indefatigable Vassar graduate with an incisive wit, Miss Curtis documented the mores and foibles of America's constantly evolving upper crust. She scrutinized both aristocrats and parvenus in sybaritic settings: Manhattan penthouses, mansions in Newport and Palm Beach, yachts in the Caribbean, tents in Persepolis and the clubhouses at Churchill and Epsom Downs.         In Palm Beach, she reported on a dowager who installed a marble terrace so her dogs, suffering from the heat, could cool their bellies.         ''Bostonians are an elegantly athletic lot,'' she wrote in a 1965 story about a society ball. ''They prove it periodically by swirling, twirling and swooping about in graceful dance patterns until beads of perspiration materialize on their aristocratic brows.'' The Telling Moment         At a cocktail party held by Leonard Bernstein for the Black Panthers in 1970, when a Panther field marshal stridently outlined his tenets before a small group that included Mr. Bernstein, principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Miss Curtis caught the telling moment:         '' 'If business won't give us full employment, then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people.'         '' 'I dig absolutely,' Mr. Bernstein said.''         Tom Wolfe, who wrote about the same party in his book ''Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,'' said of the ensuing flap: ''It wasn't anything she wrote that infuriated them. It was that she put down exactly what they said. That's always what seems cruelest of all, to hold up a mirror to people that way.''         In addition to her society and family/ style reporting, Miss Curtis over the years pursued a variety of stories with datelines from around the world. Deep Interest in Politics         Her deepest interest, dating from her college days, was in American politics and culture. She covered a number of national political conventions, including the violence-wracked Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, as well as Presidential campaigns and inaugurations.         In June 1968 she was in the press corps aboard the funeral train that carried the body of Senator Robert F. Kennedy from New York to Washington. Describing his eldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, she wrote about the heir to a political dynasty:         ''Down the swaying train he went, putting out his hand in 19 of the other 20 cars saying, 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' while outside in the early afternoon sun, the old men of Linden, N.J., stood silently in their undershirts and the women held handkerchiefs to their faces.         '' 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' he said to strangers, his pin-stripe black suit not yet a shambles from the failing air-conditioning, his PT boat tie clip neatly in place. 'Thanks for coming, thanks for coming.' ''         She was the author of ''First Lady,'' a 1963 book about Jacqueline Kennedy's first year in the White House, and ''The Rich and Other Atrocities,'' a 1976 collection of many of her articles. She also contributed writings to several other books, wrote articles for magazines and was a radio commentator in New York and Ohio. Many Honors for Reporting         Miss Curtis was the recipient of many honors for her reporting, including awards from the New York Newspaper Women's Club, the Ohio Newspaper Women's Club, the New York and Los Angeles branches of Women in Communications, the American Newspaper Women's Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the University of Southern California. She also received five honorary degrees.         A porcelain figurine of a woman with pale blue eyes and impeccably coiffed auburn hair, Miss Curtis stood 5 feet 1 inch tall in her high-heeled Chanel pumps. Her image of Junior League elegance - ladylike suits, discreet quantities of real jewelry and a faint aura of expensive French perfume -was one not usually visible in newsrooms.         Charlotte Murray Curtis was born in Chicago on Dec. 19, 1928, the daughter of George Morris and Lucile Atcherson Curtis. Her father was a surgeon who later took the family to Columbus, and her mother was a diplomat who had been the first woman to be a field officer in the Foreign Service, holding posts with American legations in Switzerland, Panama and Haiti.         Miss Curtis graduated from the Columbus School for Girls, then went to Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., majoring in United States history. After graduating in 1950, she joined The Columbus Citizen, where she was a reporter and society editor for 11 years. Joined The Times in 1961         In 1961, she was hired by The New York Times as a fashion reporter. Two years later, she was assigned to the society beat, with a mandate from Clifton Daniel, then an assistant managing editor, to ''write about society as news and to treat it as sociology.''         In 1965, she was named editor of women's news, a title that was changed to family/style editor in 1971. In 1974, she became editor of the Op-Ed page, leavening serious pieces by academic, government and business leaders with unexpected essays on lighter subjects, such as an exchange of letters between Henry Miller and Erica Jong entitled ''In Praise of Rabelais and Each Other,'' and with bits of Americana, from lesser-known writers.         Besides her husband, Miss Curtis is survived by a sister, Mary Curtis Davey of Los Altos, Calif., three stepchildren and three nieces and nephews.         A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date to be set.         The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the William E. Hunt Fund, Ohio State University Development Fund No. 523340, in care of the Division of Neurologic Surgery, Ohio State University Hospital, 410 West 10th Avenue, N-935 D.H., Columbus, Ohio, 43210.       
        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.

Claude Hill, associate principal harpist with the Metropolitan Opera orchestra for the last 25 years, died of cancer Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Hill was born in Toronto and grew up in Montreal. She was a graduate of the Montreal Conservatory of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music, and a former member of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.         She is survived by her mother, Delvia Hill, of Montreal.       
        Hermione Gingold, the irrepressible English-born comedienne whose tart, quick-witted repartee became her trademark, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived on the East Side.         Hermione Gingold, the irrepressible English-born comedienne whose tart, quick-witted repartee became her trademark, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived on the East Side.         Miss Gingold conquered Broadway in 1953 as the star of the long-running revue ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac''; she last appeared on Broadway as the narrator in Stephen Sondheim's musical entertainment ''Side by Side by Sondheim'' in 1977-78.         To a wider American public she was known as a rambunctious, ribald conversationalist on talk shows, a longtime ''irregular regular'' on ''The Jack Paar Show'' whose rejoinders more recently delighted audiences of the talk-show host Merv Griffin.         Her throaty voice is remembered from Alan Jay Lerner's movie musical ''Gigi'' (1958), in which she and Maurice Chevalier joined in the duet ''I Remember It Well.'' Miss Gingold portrayed a retired courtesan, the scheming grandmother of Leslie Caron.         She also appeared in ''The Music Man'' (1962), as the mayor's wife; ''Bell, Book and Candle'' (1958); again with Mr. Chevalier in ''I'd Rather Be Rich'' (1964), and as Mme. Armfeldt in both the stage and film versions of ''A Little Night Music,'' Mr. Sondheim's musical comedy based on Ingmar Bergman's ''Smiles of a Summer Night.'' In Wartime Revue         Miss Gingold began her career in 1911 as a child actor with Noel Coward in ''Where the Rainbow Ends.'' She acted in Shakespearean plays at the Old Vic.         But thousands of servicemen came to admire her as a comedienne in the long-running London revue ''Sweet and Low.'' Several attempts to extend her career to Broadway, one of them involving Cole Porter, failed in the best theater tradition.         Miss Gingold had her first acting engagement in this country at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., in March 1951. The vehicle was ''It's About Time,'' an intimate revue that incorporated some of her material from London.         The title proved prophetic, for '' John Murray Anderson's Almanac'' made her an instant Broadway favorite when it opened in December 1953. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it the ''funniest revue Broadway has played host to for a long time.'' Mr. Atkinson singled out one of her skits with Billy De Wolfe, in which ''Miss Gingold and Mr. De Wolfe act like a couple of geniuses.''         ''It seems like a long time since anyone acted a revue sketch with as much craft and subtlety,'' he said. ''Almanac'' ran for 227 performances, and Miss Gingold won the Donaldson Award in 1954 for her performance.         Miss Gingold acted on the straw-hat theater circuit in summer with, among others plays, Terence Rattigan's ''Sleeping Prince'' and one of her earlier London successes, Noel Coward's ''Fallen Angels.''         Another one of her roles, both on Broadway and in summer stock, was that of the fastidious mother in Arthur Kopit's ''Oh, Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad.'' 'I'm a Celebrity'         She was a tall, vibrant woman with a mobile face, large, heavy-lidded blue eyes and tousled blond hair. She delighted in television, and one of her funniest moments came on a show when she was asked whether her most recent husband was dead. ''That's a matter of opinion,'' she replied.         ''Fighting is essentially a masculine idea,'' she observed on another occasion. ''A woman's weapon is her tongue.''         On the eve of her 80th birthday, while in the cast of ''Side by Side,'' she ruefully reflected that she had always wanted to be in ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''Hamlet.'' She said: ''The trouble with me is that I'm not considered an actress anymore. I'm a celebrity.''         At 66, asked about retirement, Miss Gingold said, ''I suppose I shall drop dead in the theater, to a full house, I hope.''         Miss Gingold participated in benefits and fund raisers for causes ranging from the theater to cancer research. She wrote articles and revue sketches, a play, ''Abracadabra,' as well as a tongue-in-cheek autobiography, ''The World Is Square: My Own Unaided Work.''         Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold was born in London to an English mother and an Austrian father. She was privately educated in London and Paris.         Among her survivors are a sister and two grandchildren, all of Britain.

        Cathryn Damon, a stage and television actress who won an Emmy for her role on the popular television spoof ''Soap,'' died of cancer Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 56 years old.         Cathryn Damon, a stage and television actress who won an Emmy for her role on the popular television spoof ''Soap,'' died of cancer Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 56 years old.         Miss Damon was best known to millions of fans as Mary Campbell, the loyal wife of Burt Campbell, on the zany satire of daytime soap operas that ran on ABC from 1977-81.         The series had a loosely structured plot line that sometimes startled viewers with references to incest, adultery and homosexuality.         Miss Damon's character had to deal with a television husband who once was cloned by aliens from outer space. Both Miss Damon and Richard Mulligan, who played Burt, won Emmys in 1980 for their performances in the show. The problem-plagued television family also consisted of a son who became involved in organized crime and another son who was bisexual.         The series was so controversial that it brought 32,000 letters of protest even before ABC put it on the air. But ''Soap'' attracted a large and loyal following and ABC contended the program represented a major revolution in television comedy.         Miss Damon worked until shortly before her illness incapacitated her. Acted on Broadway         On television she was seen in the ''Matlock,'' ''Mike Hammer'' and ''Murder, She Wrote'' series. Earlier she was a neighbor on ''Webster'' and was featured in a television movie ''Not in Front of the Children.''         On Broadway and Off Broadway Miss Damon appeared in ''Flora, the Red Menace,'' ''Prisoner of Second Avenue,'' ''The Last of the Red Hot Lovers,'' ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' ''The Boys From Syracuse'' and ''Passion.''         Survivors include her mother, M. Cathryn Springer, and a sister, June Ferol Damon.         CATHRYN DAMON DEAD AT 56

        Atsuko Chiba, a Japanese journalist known for her candid pieces describing her battle with cancer, died of the disease July 9 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Atsuko Chiba, a Japanese journalist known for her candid pieces describing her battle with cancer, died of the disease July 9 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Chiba wrote a column titled, ''Living With Cancer,'' which was published every Friday beginning in 1983 in The Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest daily newspaper in Japan. It also has a United States edition. Her final column appeared May 15, the newspaper said.         Miss Chiba was born in Shanghai and received her bachelor's degree in economics from Gakushuin University.         She worked as an economics reporter for three years for The Tokyo Shimbun before attending Harvard University as a Neiman journalism fellow in the class of 1968. Tokyo Correspondent         She also worked as the Tokyo correspondent for the Asian Wall Street Journal when it was established in the 1970's and later worked as a freelance journalist for many American, British, Australian and Hong Kong publications.         In 1981, Miss Chiba underwent surgery for breast cancer in Tokyo. She moved to New York in 1983. From New York, she wrote about the differences between Japanese and American views on cancer. She also wrote 13 books, including, ''A New Woman,'' and ''Living With Cancer in New York.'' She founded a monthly newsletter for Japanse career women.         She was one of the first Japanese journalists to tackle the topic of cancer, and shocked some people with her forthright descriptions of how the disease had affected her life.         In one book, ''Cancer Can't Defeat Me,'' Miss Chiba criticized the Japanese medical establishment and condemned the Japanese public's general insensitivity to cancer patients. Writing Until the End         In a 1981 interview, Miss Chiba said, ''Now I know how I will die, writing something until the end.'' And friends said that she was worrying about deadlines until two days before her death.         All proceeds from the sale of her property will go toward a fund for journalists from developing nations in Asia.         Miss Chiba is survived by her mother and three sisters, Nobuko Matsuura, Fumiko Chiba and Haruko Chiba, all of Tokyo.

        Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Miss Negri was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia last week, hospital officials said yesterday. Her physician, Dr. Houston Wade, said she had been diagnosed two years ago as having a brain tumor. She decided not to undergo treatment, he said.         There were believed to be no survivors.  ----  Most Exotic of Stars         The 1920's and 30's were the Age of the Vamp in the movies, and of all the screen vamps, Pola Negri was, unquestionably, the most colorful, the most exotic, the most mysterious.         The Polish-born Miss Negri was a startlingly beautiful woman, with skin as delicately white as fine porcelain, jet black hair and flashing dark-green eyes.         Her off-screen life was more tempestuous than any role she ever played and, although she often insisted that she wished only to be left alone, she could shrewdly maneuver her love affairs and feuds into avalanches of personal publicity.         Men found her fascinating. She married two noblemen and divorced both. She was the mistress and fiancee of Charles Chaplin, whom she jilted in a whirl of headlines. She was living openly with Rudolph Valentino, the romantic idol of millions of women the world over, at the time of his death in 1926. And Adolf Hitler was so taken with her that he personally intervened to countermand an order, issued by the Nazis on the ground that they thought Miss Negri was part-Jewish, forbidding her to work in Germany.         The temperamental star flourished in the long-gone era of the flamboyant screen siren, competing for roles and popularity with such other stars as Gloria Swanson and Theda Bara. Festooned in Diamonds         Whenever she appeared in public, she was festooned in diamonds and pearl brooches from her $1 million collection, acquired cut-rate from Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns who could no longer afford them. She popularized painted toenails in the mid-20's, and when she took to wearing turbans, or appeared in high boots, thousands of American women slavishly copied her.         She maintained a mansion in Beverly Hills, a villa on the Riviera and a chateau north of Paris, and just before the crash of 1929 her personal fortune was estimated at $5 million. She lost most of her money and possessions, however, and spent her last years living in elegant simplicity in San Antonio.         In ''Memoirs of a Star,'' published in 1970, Miss Negri wrote that she was born in Lipno, Poland, on New Year's Eve, 1899. (Other sources, however, give the date as three to five years earlier.) Her mother was the former Eleanora de Kielczeska, from a family of impoverished nobility; her father was Jerzy Mathias-Chalupec, a Slovak immigrant.         Miss Negri's two sisters died in childhood. Her father was arrested by Czarist troops in 1905 for revolutionary activity in what was then Russian Poland. He was sent to prison and, although he was ultimately released, he did not return to his wife and daughter.         Miss Negri's mother had to go to work as a cook to maintain a one-room apartment in a Warsaw slum and earn enough money to send Pola to the Imperial Ballet School. Pola's first public performance was in the role of a cygnet in ''Swan Lake,'' with the Imperial Ballet. Illness Ended Dance Career         Her dancing career ended when she was 13 years old, however, because she contracted tuberculosis and had to be sent to a sanitarium. Pronounced cured a year later, she returned to Warsaw and was admitted for study at the Imperial Academy of Dramatic Arts after falsely stating she was 17. It was at that time that she adopted her stage name - Pola, the diminutive of her given name, Apolonia, and Negri, after Ada Negri, an Italian poet whom she admired.         She was one of Poland's leading actresses when she was 17, at which time she made her first movie, a two-reeler called ''Slaves of Sin.'' In 1918 she went to Berlin to perform a leading role in Max Reinhardt's pantomime ''Sumurun,'' which was later filmed as her third full-length movie.         Miss Negri's roles in her first two pictures, ''The Eyes of the Mummy Ma'' and ''Carmen,'' typed her as the man-ruining vamp. She took time out from her career in 1919 to be the wife, briefly, of Count Eugene Dambski, a Polish army career officer, then returned to Berlin to make films. ''Madame Du Barry,'' released in the United States under the title ''Passion,'' won her a Paramount Pictures contract and she was brought here in 1922.         During the Atlantic crossing, Miss Negri's agent scolded her for spending most of her time in her cabin. ''Make a few appearances,'' he said. ''Think of the publicity.''         ''I am thinking of it,'' she replied. ''We will get more publicity this way. I have already learned that the fewer appearances you make, the more they will talk about you. All you have to do is to say you want to be alone - and the whole world thinks you are exotic and glamorous. It never occurs to them that you are simply tired.'' Feud With Swanson         In Hollywood, while carefully limiting her public appearances, Miss Negri, with equal assiduity, cultivated several headlined feuds, most notably with Gloria Swanson, her rival at Paramount. (The leading ladies once had a cat fight using real cats.) Miss Negri's Hollywood films were not artistic landmarks, but most were extremely successful at the box office. Among them were ''Belle Donna'' (1923), her first American movie; ''The Cheat'' (1923); ''Men'' (1924); ''The Spanish Dancer'' (1923); ''Shadows of Paris'' (1924); ''East of Suez'' (1925) and ''Forbidden Paradise'' (1924). At the height of her popularity, she was so much in demand that she ground out five pictures in a single year.         However, she always seemed able to find time for romance. Her first big headlined Hollywood affair was with Charlie Chaplin, who in 1964 wrote in his autobiography that the relationship was essentially one of the pursued (Chaplin) and the pursuer (Negri). In her own memoirs Miss Negri observed tartly:         ''A great deal has been written about my relationship with Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, much of it has been written by Mr. Chaplin. Still less fortunately, what he wrote was largely untrue. Rather than say he behaved in less than a gentlemanly fashion, I would prefer to excuse him on the grounds that all clowns live in a world of fantasy.''         Miss Negri went on to say that her relationship with Mr. Chaplin had been intimate and stormy, that he was an inept lover, that he proposed marriage and that finally she ended the affair, over Mr. Chaplin's tearful entreaties. Her Greatest Love         According to Miss Negri, the greatest love of her life was Rudolph Valentino. On their second meeting, she wrote in her memoirs, she found him so passionately overpowering that on that very night they became lovers and remained so for nearly a year, until his death in 1926.         Valentino, called by his adoring public ''The Great Lover,'' was indeed the great lover, she wrote, capable of making such romantic gestures as sprinkling rose petals on the bed before they retired. He could also be quite prosaic. For example, he often wept because he was losing his hair, and sometimes the sex symbol of American women preferred making spaghetti for Miss Negri to making love to her.         After collapsing at Valentino's funeral in New York, Miss Negri took his body back to California by train, stopping at dozens of stations along the way so that hysterical Valentino-worshipers could pay him tribute. She was accused of using the cortege to garner personal publicity, and, true or not, soon afterward her popularity at the box office waned. When her contract came up for renewal, she found she was no longer wanted at Paramount.         Her standing with the Valentino cult was forever shattered when, in 1927, less than a year after Valentino's death, Miss Negri was married to Serge Mdivani, an impecunious Georgian prince, and took him to live in her chateau in France. They were divorced in 1931, after Miss Negri had lost the bulk of her fortune through, she later wrote, her husband's mismanagement of her affairs during the stock-market crisis. Went to Berlin in 1935         After the indifferent reception to her first talkie, ''A Woman Commands,'' Miss Negri in 1935 fled Hollywood for Berlin, where she made pictures until the outbreak of World War II. For a time she was prohibited from working by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, who put her name on a list of suspected ''non-Aryans.''         Hitler, who was said to be so fond of her German-made movie about mother love, ''Mazurka,'' that he had it run weekly so he could have a good cry, personally overruled Goebbels. Shortly after, newspapers in Europe and the United States printed reports of a romance between Hitler and Miss Negri. She sued the French magazine that initiated the reports and won a 10,000-franc judgment.         Miss Negri, who was living on the Riviera when Germany invaded France, returned to the United States in 1941. Two years later she played a featured comedy role in ''Hi Diddle Diddle,'' but no other film offers were forthcoming.         By the end of the war, she was reduced to living in one room in a small hotel in New York and selling off her jewelry to survive. Ultimately, she recovered some money and property tied up in Europe during the war.         From 1948 to 1963, Miss Negri lived in California and Texas with Margaret L. West, who bequeathed her property in San Antonio. In recent years Miss Negri lived in a duplex apartment in San Antonio, attended by a maid, a chauffeur and a secretary.         Miss Negri made her last attempted comeback in ''The Moonspinners,'' a Walt Disney film released in 1964. As production on the movie began in London in 1963, she proved she had not lost her knack for finding a bizarre gimmick sure to give her headlines. For her first press conference, she entered the room with a frisky cheetah on a leash.       
        Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         ''A middle-aged energetic woman who thinks she knows where she's going'' is the way Mrs. Rose described herself 10 years ago, shortly before Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed her a Deputy Mayor. She was the first woman to hold such a job.         Mrs. Rose, whose style reflected her youth in Virginia and Brooklyn, moved through a variety of managerial jobs related to labor.         ''I've gone step by step,'' Mrs. Rose said in 1977. ''They haven't let me skip a step.''         The first step was a job as a fiscal clerk in the Department of Social Services, which in 1949 paid $1,860 a year.         After earning a degree in economics from Brooklyn College in 1963, she was named director of the Bedford-Stuyvesant field office of the city's Department of Labor. Her responsibilities were gradually expanded, and in 1970 Mayor John V. Lindsay named her first deputy commissioner of the city Manpower and Career Development Agency.         In 1972, she became Commissioner of the Department of Employment. While she was in charge of that agency, its budget grew from $55 million to $300 million.         Mrs. Rose was born in Richmond on Sept. 27, 1920. Her family moved to Brooklyn when she was 7 years old, and her mother and father opened the Mason Dining Room at the corner of Fulton Street and Albany Avenue.         After her father died, her mother operated the 12-table restaurant by herself. Mrs. Rose's mother also made dresses in the evening to support the family. ''My mother didn't believe in welfare,'' Mrs. Rose recalled in 1972.         Mrs. Rose often left school to help serve the lunchtime crowd at the restaurant. She attended Public School 3 and was graduated from Girls High School in 1937.         During World War II, she worked as a welder in the construction of the battleship Missouri.         Mrs. Rose was the first woman president of the Catholic Interracial Council. She also held posts in other civic and political organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the National Democratic Committee; the Salvation Army Advisory Committee, and St. Mary's Hospital. She was recently elected president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn chapter of the Lioness Club.         She is survived by a son, Cornelius.       
        Dr. Carol Nunis Lazarus, chief psychologist at the Southeast Nassau Guidance Center, died of breast cancer Aug. 9 in the Janker Klinik in Bonn, West Germany. She was 57 years old and lived in Garden City, L.I.         Dr. Carol Nunis Lazarus, chief psychologist at the Southeast Nassau Guidance Center, died of breast cancer Aug. 9 in the Janker Klinik in Bonn, West Germany. She was 57 years old and lived in Garden City, L.I.         Dr. Lazarus became associated with the Guidance Center, which among its activities treats alcohol and drug-related problems, in 1977. The center has offices in Seaford, L.I., and Wantagh, L.I.         Earlier she worked at South Shore Center for Psychotherapy, in Wantagh, and at the South Oaks Hospital, in Amityville, L.I.         She was born in Bethlehem, Pa., graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1950 and received a master's degree from its graduate school of business in 1951. She also earned two psychology degrees at Adelphi University, a master's in 1975 and a doctorate in 1978, Dr. Lazarus was an adjunct professor of psychology at the Florida Institute of Technology and an instructor and lecturer at Hofstra University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Harold Lazarus; her mother, Louise Comens of Bethlehem; a sister, Dr. Iris Rotberg of Potomac, Md., and two sons, Eric, of Garden City and Mark, of Jackson, Miss.       
        Peggy K. Glover, who worked in day care in East Harlem and the Bronx for more than 30 years, died Sunday at White Plains Hospital, after a brief illness. She was 67 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Peggy K. Glover, who worked in day care in East Harlem and the Bronx for more than 30 years, died Sunday at White Plains Hospital, after a brief illness. She was 67 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Glover was treasurer and a director of the nonsectarian Sunshine Nurseries, two pioneering day-care centers started in the early 1920's in East Harlem and the Bronx. Her mother, the late Louise Kalmus, was one of the founders of the centers, which were taken over by the New York City Department of Human Resources in 1978.         Mrs. Glover was born in New York City. She graduated from the Fieldston School and from Wellesley College, with honors, in 1941. She had been an officer of the Scarsdale League of Women Voters and chairman of the Scarsdale Parent-Teachers Association.         She is survived by her husband, Stuart B. Glover; a brother, Allan H. Kalmus of Manhattan; two sons, James D., of White Plains, and Richard K., of Stamford, Conn., and four grandchildren.

She is survived by her mother, Ann, of Westport.       
        Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Chute, who was born in Minneapolis in 1913, published her first story in 1931. She wrote many stories for and about adolescent boys for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines during the 1930's, and her first book, ''Blocking Back,'' was published in 1938. Many of her early works, such as ''Shattuck Cadet'' (1940) and ''Camp Hero'' (1942), were realistic tales of sports and camp life that captured the relationships and slang of her primarily male teen-age heroes.         Although she continued to write short stories for children and adolescents in the 1940's, Miss Chute began to concentrate on adult fiction with ''The Fields Are White,'' a 1950 book about marriage and manners.         Her best-known novel, ''Greenwillow'' (1956), was described by a critic as ''a deeply moving, gently humorous and serenely wise'' story of young love and self-discovery. It was made into a Broadway musical in 1960. Subsequent works included a 1957 anthology called ''The Blue Cup and Other Stories,'' ''The Story of a Small Life'' (1971) and ''Katie: An Impertinent Fairy Tale'' (1978). Taught at Barnard         Her most recent novel, ''The Good Woman'' (1986), was a parable about a lonely woman who abandons her home for a journey of spiritual awakening while living on the streets.         Miss Chute - who preferred to be called Joy and signed her books B. J. Chute - moved to New York in the early 1940's with her mother and two sisters. Over the years, she did volunteer work with poor children and the Police Athletic League. She became an adjunct professor of English at Barnard College in 1964, and taught creative writing there until her death.         She was also director of Books Across the Sea, a division of the English-Speaking Union that promoted American books overseas, and was an active member and one-time president of the American chapter of PEN, the writer's association.         Miss Chute is survived by two sisters, Marchette Chute, an author, of Manhattan, and Mary Chute Smith, of Morristown, N.J.         A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue and 53d Street, on Oct. 8 at 5:15 P.M.

She was 83 years old and lived in Clifton, N.J.         Mollie Kofman, mother of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, died Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Passaic, N.J. The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease. She was 83 years old and lived in Clifton, N.J.         Mrs. Kofman, who was born in Minsk, Russia, came here when she was 2 years old. She married Samuel Lautenberg in 1923. After his death, she married George Kofman.         Surviving are Senator Lautenberg, of Montclair, N.J.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
        Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Astor entered silent films in 1920 as a willowy 14-year-old and portrayed scores of vulnerable ingenues. Two decades later she gave her most indelible performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' John Huston's crime classic. Her subtle, mature portrayal of a seemingly sympathetic woman who was, in fact, evilly duplicitous, took audiences by surprise. Such women were rarely the heroines of movies then, nor had they been portrayed as deceptively as Miss Astor portrayed the homicidal Brigid O'Shaughnessy.         In the same year, 1941, she was a ruthless, egocentric concert pianist battling Bette Davis in ''The Great Lie,'' for which Miss Astor won an Oscar as the best actress in a supporting role. ''If I'd had my druthers,'' she later wrote, ''I would have preferred getting my Oscar for 'The Maltese Falcon.' '' Sophisticates and Villains         Other skillful characterizations included a warmly urbane widow in ''Dodsworth'' (1936), a spurned mistress in the 1937 version of the swashbuckling ''Prizoner of Zenda,'' a disillusioned wife in ''The Hurricane'' (1937) and a sympathetic prostitute in ''Act of Violence'' (1949).         But few of her films matched the turmoil of her private life. In 1936, she was the center of one of Hollywood's most spectacular scandals when she sued Dr. Franklyn Thorpe for legal custody of their 4-year-old daughter, Marylyn. Dr. Thorpe had divorced Miss Astor a year earlier.         The suit led to disclosure of her diary, which allegedly contained accounts of liaisons with many celebrities. Dr. Thorpe sought to use the diary to prove she was an unfit mother, and purported excerpts were published in newspapers under suggestive headlines.         Miss Astor repeatedly maintained that the excerpts were lurid forgeries. She later acknowledged that an authentic portion published by one newspaper included ''a rather overemotional account of a romantic interlude with George S. Kaufman,'' the playwright.         The trial judge ordered the diary sealed and impounded. It was inadmissible as evidence, she wrote later, because her former husband had removed pages involving himself. Miss Astor was granted custody of her daughter for nine months a year, with Dr. Thorpe allowed custody the three other months. The diary was never made public, and a judge witnessed its burning in 1952. Won Beauty Contest at 11         During the 30-day trial, Hollywood producers, fearing the scandal would damage the film industry, pressed Miss Astor to drop the suit, but she refused, risking her reputation and career to keep her daughter. Soon after the trial, throngs of people hailed her courage when she toured with screenings of ''Dodsworth.''         Mary Astor was born Lucile Langhanke on May 3, 1906, in Quincy, Ill., the only child of the former Helen Vasconcells, an American, and Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke, a German immigrant who made an uncertain income from such diverse activities as teaching German and poultry farming until he began to cash in on his daughter's film success.         The girl won her first movie contract with Famous Players-Lasky and, with it, the name Mary Astor. Within two years she was making features and her salary started soaring. In 1923, the family went to Hollywood and she became John Barrymore's leading lady in ''Beau Brummel.''         She was teamed with Barrymore again in ''Don Juan'' (1926), which introduced a Vitaphone background-music soundtrack, the harbinger of talkies. Her early sound films included ''Holiday'' (1930), playing the materialistic sister of Ann Harding, and ''Red Dust'' (1932), in which she portrayed a frustrated wife attracted to Clark Gable. Sued for Nonsupport by Parents         Later movies included ''Midnight'' (1939), ''Brigham Young - Frontiersman'' (1940), ''Across the Pacific'' (1942), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942), ''Claudia and David'' (1946) and ''Return to Peyton Place'' (1961).         Miss Astor's professional successes were punctuated by personal tragedies. In 1930, her first husband, Kenneth Hawks, was killed in a plane crash while directing a movie.         Her parents lived lavishly, taking nearly all her salary, but in 1934 she put them on an allowance. Unable to continue embellishing the mansion and estate she had given them, they sued her for nonsupport. She said that ''from 1920 to 1930, I gave my father $461,000'' while she kept only $24,000. She agreed to pay them $100 a month, and the suit was dismissed.         After the diary scandal, Miss Astor was married to Manuel del Campo, a Mexican sportsman, by whom she had a son, Anthony, and later to Thomas G. Wheelock, a businessman. Both marriages ended in divorce. A Drinking Problem         Her tangled personal life and the financial pressures to keep working worsened a longtime drinking problem. She sought help from a priest-psychologist, the Rev. Peter Ciklic, and to further her therapy, he had her write notes about her life. At his urging, she revised the notes into a 1959 autobiography, ''My Story.'' It was praised by reviewers for its style and uncompromising insights.         Personally regenerated, she began writing novels and completed a successful memoir on movie making, ''A Life on Film,'' in 1971. Her first novel, ''The Incredible Charlie Carewe,'' about a charming rotter, was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as ''lively entertainment.''         In ''A Life on Film,'' Miss Astor deplored a ''poverty of spirit'' in many contemporary movies, writing that ''whatever we did - we old moviemakers - we gave people a lot of fun. Through depressions and wars and calamities, we gave them the sense of glory, of a future that would be braver than today.''         Miss Astor retired to the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills in 1974 and contributed to it from her writing income.         Besides her daughter and son, the actress is survived by an undisclosed number of grandchildren. A funeral service will be private.       
        Antoinette Faissex du Bost Castelli, the president of Castelli Graphics Gallery in Manhattan, died of a hemorrhage yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was being treated for cancer. She was 58 years old.         Antoinette Faissex du Bost Castelli, the president of Castelli Graphics Gallery in Manhattan, died of a hemorrhage yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was being treated for cancer. She was 58 years old.         As president of Castelli Graphics, on East 77th Street, Mrs. Castelli showed such major artists as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and James Rosenquist, who were also affiliated with the galleries of Leo Castelli, her husband. But she ran her gallery independently and also exhibited such artists as Robert Cumming, Bernard Faucon and Pat Steir.         Mrs. Castelli was born near Limoges, France, and spent most of her early life in Paris. She married Mr. Castelli in 1963.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Jean-Christophe; her mother, Edmee Haviland, and two sisters.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.

Weithorn, a developmental psychologist and university lecturer, died of cancer Friday at Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park, L.I. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhasset, L.I.         Dr. Weithorn was born in the Bronx in 1929 and graduated from New York University in 1949. She earned a master's degree in psychology at Queens College and a doctorate in developmental psychology at the City University of New York Graduate School and University Center.         Upon finishing her studies in 1969, Dr. Weithorn joined the faculty of Queens College. An authority on childhood learning disabilities, she lectured on that and other topics in psychology to graduate students.

Miss Suesse, who also wrote ''Whistling in the Dark,'' ''My Silent Love'' and ''Blue Moonlight,'' achieved widespread fame in 1932 when the orchestra leader Paul Whiteman commissioned her to write a jazz concerto for piano and orchestra. The work, ''Concerto in Three Rhythms,'' was such a success that the next year, another Whiteman commission, ''Symphonic Waltzes,'' followed.         Miss Suesse, who was born in Shreveport, La., in 1911, came to New York in 1931 with her mother, an opera singer, and began working as a songwriter; her first hit was ''Have You Forgotten?'' in 1931.

        Maxeda vonHesse, a speech teacher whose clients included Nelson A. Rockefeller and Christian A. Herter, died of lymphoma Sept. 22 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Daytona Beach, Fla.         Maxeda vonHesse, a speech teacher whose clients included Nelson A. Rockefeller and Christian A. Herter, died of lymphoma Sept. 22 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Daytona Beach, Fla.

She carried on the work begun by her mother, Elisabeth Ferguson vonHesse, who died in 1963, coaching actors, politicians, business executives and others.         Miss vonHesse said speech lessons were more than exercises in diction and she worked with a student's ''total personality,'' including gestures, stance, timing, walk and delivery.         Miss vonHesse taught Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Herter during their respective campaigns for governor of New York and governor of Massachusetts.         She was born in Denver and graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. She contended she never needed speech lessons because she came from ''a long line of preachers and teachers, who taught us early to appreciate the power of words.''         There are no immediate survivors.

        Maria Ivogun, the leading coloratura soprano of German opera in the period between the World Wars, died yesterday. She was 95 years old and lived in Beatenberg, Switzerland.         Maria Ivogun, the leading coloratura soprano of German opera in the period between the World Wars, died yesterday. She was 95 years old and lived in Beatenberg, Switzerland.         The soprano was born Maria Kempner in Budapest on Nov. 18, 1891. Her stage name was a construction based on the name of her mother, Ida von Gunther, a well-known operetta singer.         Ivogun made her debut as Mimi in ''La Boheme'' in 1913, under the direction of Bruno Walter in Munich. She quickly became one of the most popular singers on the German scene, a position she maintained for two decades. Guest appearances took her to the leading opera houses of New York, Chicago, London and Milan. Her artistic home base remained Munich until 1925, when she followed Walter to Berlin.         Her principal roles were Susanna in ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' the Queen of the Night in ''The Magic Flute'' and the leading female parts in ''The Barber of Seville,'' ''Rigoletto,'' ''Don Pasquale'' and other operas. She was the first to sing Zerbinetta in the revised version of Richard Strauss' ''Ariadne auf Naxos.''         In 1921 she married the noted tenor Karl Erb. They were divorced in 1932, and in the next year she married the pianist Michael Raucheisen, who died in 1984.         At the time of her second marriage she retired from singing - still, as her recordings of 1932 demonstrate, at the height of her powers - and began a long and notable career as a teacher. Among her many successful pupils were the sopranos Rita Streich and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. The latter maintained close contact with Ivogun and continued to consult her on pedagogical issues to the end of her life.         Ivogun made about 60 recordings from 1916 to 1932. They show a fresh, silvery voice and a merry style that could be tinged with pathos in melancholy arias. Her version of Zerbinetta's long aria from ''Ariadne'' has long been considered a classic, and her Johann Strauss waltzes sparkled with life.
