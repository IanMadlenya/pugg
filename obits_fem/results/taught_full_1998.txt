         Marilyn Costello, the principal harpist of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 46 years and a respected teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Philadelphia. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Ann Diebold, a spokeswoman for the Curtis Institute.         Ms. Costello was born in Cleveland and began her musical studies as a pianist. She made her public debut in a concert at the Cleveland Museum of Art when she was 6, and won prizes in several competitions while a teen-ager. She decided to study the harp when she was 14, after running her hands across the instrument's strings backstage at a concert of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Her principal studies were with Carlos Salzedo, the composer and harpist, at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and it was during her second year as a student there, in 1945, that Eugene Ormandy, the conductor, invited her to join the Philadelphia Orchestra. She was the orchestra's second harpist for about half a season, and was appointed principal harpist in 1946, a position she held until her retirement in 1992.         Ms. Costello joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute in 1962, and taught harpists who eventually took positions in many of the world's great orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony and the National Symphony.         She is survived by her husband, L. Daniel Dannenbaum; a son, Daniel George Dannenbaum, and two stepdaughters, Marianne Kierstead of Merrimack, N.H., and Alison Lang of Lillooet, British Columbia.       
         Mary Ingraham Bunting-Smith, the Radcliffe president who sought ways to help educated women carve out careers in a society not yet transformed by the feminist movement and became a mentor to several female writers, performers and scholars, died on Wednesday at Kendal at Hanover, a continuing care community in New Hampshire. She was 87.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, a microbiologist who was Radcliffe president from 1959 to 1972, was called Polly from childhood and added Smith to her name after her second marriage,  in 1979.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was also known for overseeing the fuller integration of Radcliffe College into Harvard, founded the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study -- now the Bunting Institute -- to help women who were scholars, writers, artists and scientists return to careers interrupted by family obligations.         ''Polly Bunting was always ahead of her time in anticipating the needs of women and of Radcliffe College,'' said Derek Bok, president emeritus of Harvard and a professor there. ''The idea of the Radcliffe Institute seems so obvious now. But the idea that there would be women who wanted to come back was a new idea then, and she saw that and created an institution that made it possible.''         Mrs. Bunting-Smith was also the first female member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the President's Committee on the Status of Women and a vice president of the Peace Corps.         Underused women and interrupted careers were a theme for Mrs. Bunting-Smith. She chided society for its ''waste of highly talented, educated womenpower,'' as she put it in a 1961 article she wrote for The New York Times Magazine, calling it a ''prodigious national extravagance.''         A soft-spoken woman who herself had worked part time while her children were young, she devoted her life to fighting that waste, to raising expectations among and about women and to creating opportunities for them.         As she saw it, two ''hidden dissuaders'' lowered the professional expectations of women: a system of higher education that, first, ignored real differences between male and female patterns of life and, second, did not provide for women who wanted to keep working part time in their fields while raising families. She established the Radcliffe Institute specifically to give scholarships to women cut off from careers by marriage.         To see a model of an active, engaged woman, Mrs. Bunting-Smith had only to look within her own family. Born in Brooklyn in 1910, she was one of four children of Mary Shotwell Ingraham, who was president of both the Brooklyn Young Women's Christian Association and the Y.W.C.A.'s national board. Her mother was also  a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education who helped plan the creation of the City University. Her father was Henry A. Ingraham, a lawyer and one of the founders of Long Island College of Medicine.         In her early years, Polly Bunting loved being outside. Although an avid reader, she did not go to school regularly until high school, because of her uncertain health. And she did not enjoy school. ''I was glad to get rid of it in the afternoon and get back to something interesting,'' she once said.         A growing interest in the sciences drew her into academia. She majored in physics at Vassar College, her mother's alma mater. At the University of Wisconsin, she studied agricultural bacteriology, earning a master's degree and a doctorate and meeting her husband, Henry Bunting, a medical student who shared her interest in hiking and bird watching. During his medical residency, she taught at Bennington College in Vermont. They married in 1937 and moved to Connecticut, where he was on the faculty of Yale University and she conducted research, working on the effects of radiation on bacteria.         While her four children were young, she spent more time at home, in Bethany, Conn. But even with young children, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was a 4-H leader, served on the library and school boards and was one of the organizers and directors of the Public Health Nursing Association.         When her husband died of a brain tumor in 1954, however, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was forced to look for a full-time job. Because she was a woman, there were no faculty openings at Yale, her son Charles recalled yesterday, and she jumped at the offer to become dean of Douglass College, the women's college of Rutgers University. She was a professor in the department of bacteriology there and an honorary professor at the Rutgers Institute of Microbiology.         At Douglass, she introduced a multilingual course in world poetry run by the students, as well as a program of part-time study for married women.         Five years later, at age 48, she was offered a job as the fifth president of Radcliffe College, the undergraduate college for women at Harvard University, with about 1,775 women.         She liked talking to students and kept an open door. She taught a freshman seminar. In meetings with students, she would sometimes kick off her shoes and invite her guests to do the same, and to join her on the floor. She also liked to chat with students who dropped by her Brattle Street house, and she would turn on her porch light on to signal that she was in.         Such access did not protect her from student protest. In the late 1960's, 20 black students sat in the Radcliffe administration offices seeking increased minority enrollment. Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was at a conference in North Carolina, flew back to meet with the protesters and promised to act on their complaints. She faced other protests during the Vietnam War.         Another source of dissension was her work to merge Radcliffe more completely into Harvard. Radcliffe students already took classes with Harvard students, but they were admitted to college separately and had their own living quarters, administration and trustees. Mrs. Bunting-Smith thought the system inequitable and worked to integrate the campuses more fully, even though it ultimately reduced the role of the Radcliffe president.         But she may be best remembered for the establishment of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, which opened in 1961 with the help of $150,000 from the Carnegie Foundation and other grants. Its purpose was to pursue research into the psychological and cultural factors that affected women's status in society, and also to support female artists, scientists and scholars, particularly those who had suspended their careers because of family responsibilities.         In its first year the institute gave 20 women scholarships of up to $3,000 each, space to do their work and access to Radcliffe and Harvard services.         The poet Maxine Kumin, a member of that first group of scholars, remembers her two years at the institute as an ''amazing'' experience, with a diverse group of artists, scientists, social scientists and poets, ''with Polly Bunting as our ringmaster.''         Ms. Kumin said that at a time when she was teaching English composition to physical education majors at Tufts University because only men were allowed to teach liberal arts majors, ''being chosen as a Radcliffe scholar put an imprimatur on what you were doing and gave it legitimacy.''         Since that first class of scholars, more than 1,200 women have been given fellowships at the institute, including the author Alice Walker, the psychologist Carol Gilligan; former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont; the poets Anne Sexton and Sophie Cabot Black; the performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; the anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, and the geophysicist and astronaut Marcia McNutt.         After Mrs. Bunting-Smith stepped down as president of Radcliffe in 1972, she spent three years as special assistant to the president of Princeton University, William Bowen, working on coeducation there.         In 1979, she married Dr. Clement A. Smith, a pediatrician and faculty member at Harvard. He died in 1988.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith is survived by three sons, Charles I. Bunting of Shelbourne, Vt., William H. Bunting of North Whitefield, Me., and John E. Bunting of New Boston, N.H.; a daughter, Mary B. Decher of Bellevue, Wash; three stepdaughters,  Pamela Smith of Harvard, Me., Gail Smith Biggar of Concord, Mass., and Hilary Smith of Peacham, Vt.; a stepson, Reynolds Smith of Harvard, Me.; a sister, Winifred I. Warner of Laurel Hollow, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Alma Hawkins, a pioneering modern-dance educator who founded the dance department at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Jan. 8 at her home in Santa Monica. She was 94.         Born in Rolla, Mo., Dr. Hawkins graduated from the University of Missouri and went on to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she became interested in modern dance. She trained in dance at Bennington College and in Colorado before earning master's and doctor's degrees at Columbia.         She taught at Emporia State University in Kansas and George Williams College in Chicago before joining the dance program at U.C.L.A.; she was its chairwoman from 1953 to her retirement in 1977.         In 1962, Dr. Hawkins established an autonomous dance department, equal in status to the departments of art, music and theater arts, at the College of Fine Arts at the university.         According to the University of California at Los Angeles, it was the nation's first university dance department, eventually offering degrees in dance therapy, dance history, esthetics and education as well as choreography and performance.         Dr. Hawkins encouraged the establishment of an interdepartmental program in ethnic arts that later became the world arts and cultures program. She worked closely with dance presenters to bring leading American and foreign troupes to perform at Royce Hall at the university.         In 1967, she formed the Council of Dance Administrators, a product of a national conference on dance sponsored by the arts and humanities division of the United States Office of Education.         The council published ''Standards for Dance Major Programs'' of colleges in 1979, leading to a national dance certification program. Also in 1967, Dr. Hawkins founded the West Coast Dance Film Archives. She later founded the national Council of Graduate Dance/Movement Therapy Educators.         Dr. Hawkins was a dance therapist and researcher at the university's Neuropsychiatric Institute from 1960 to 1977, training dance therapists and creating a series of educational research films about the field. On her retirement from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hawkins taught for more than 10 years in the dance department at Santa Monica College.         She is survived by her sister, Alice Hawkins of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Dr. Jean Trepp McKelvey, who hurdled gender barriers in the field of labor-management mediation and opened the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, died on Jan. 5 at the Kirkhaven Nursing Home in her hometown of Rochester. She was 89.         She taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 13 years until 1946, when Cornell formed the new branch on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus and appointed her as its first faculty member. She wrote the curriculum for the school and taught courses in arbitration, labor law and labor practices.         She assumed emeritus status in 1976 but continued to teach and coordinate the school's off-campus graduate credit courses given under extension programs in Albany, Corning, Elmira, Rochester and Syracuse. In a tribute to her and another faculty member, the school, known by its initials, I.L.R., established its first endowed chair in 1994 and named it the Jean McKelvey-Alice Grant Professorship of Labor Management Relations.         Many of her former students went on to fill influential positions as union leaders, arbitrators and jurists. The year after she arrived at Cornell, she became a charter member -- and the sole woman at the time -- in the National Academy of Arbitrators. In 1970, she was the first woman to be elected president of the academy and, mindful of the overwhelming preponderance of men in her metier, came up with an arbitration training program for women.         Outside the classroom, Dr. McKelvey was a sought-after arbitrator for the airline industry as well as other sectors of the economy. Gov. W. Averell Harriman named her to the  State Board of Mediation in 1955, and she served on it for 11 years, helping settle thorny disputes like a wholesale butchers' strike in 1961.         President Richard M. Nixon appointed her to the Federal Services Impasses Panel in 1970, and she remained on it until eight years ago. At her death, she was still a member of the Public Review Board of the United Automobile Workers.         She was the author of many papers and books and edited the proceedings of several annual meetings of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Among her books were ''Cleared for Takeoff: Airline Labor Relations Since Deregulation'' (I.L.R. Press, 1988), ''The Changing Law of Fair Representation'' (I.L.R., 1985), ''New Challenges to Arbitration'' (I.L.R., 1977) and ''A.F.L. Attitudes Toward Production, 1900-1932'' (Greenwood, 1974).         She was born Jean Trepp in St. Louis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1929. She received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College in 1931 and 1933 and joined the Sarah Lawrence faculty in the year between. During World War II, she was a hearing officer and arbitrator for the National War Labor Board.         She is survived by her husband of 63 years, Blake McKelvey, Rochester's city historian emeritus, and a brother, Richard Trepp of Springfield, Mass.       
         Dr. Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber, a physicist who contributed to scientists' understanding of nuclear fission and the structure of atomic nuclei, died on Monday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue, N.Y. She was 86 and lived at Bayport on Long Island.         Dr. Goldhaber was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and retired as a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.         She was credited with the discovery that spontaneous fission is associated with the emission of neutrons. She made that observation in 1942 when she was a research physicist at the University of Illinois, but it was classified top secret and not announced until after World War II.         Dr. Goldhaber added to the knowledge of the structure of the nucleus when she found regularities in nuclear excited states. She also worked in areas that included long-lived isomers (different versions of elements) and heavy ions (positively and negatively charged atoms or molecules).         In 1948, she and her husband, Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, determined that  beta rays were identical with electrons, which settled an argument among their peers.         She was elected a fellow of the American Physics Society in 1947 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980, and to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.         Born in Mannheim, Germany, she earned a doctoral degree at the University of Munich in 1935 and moved to England to do research at Imperial College in London.         She did research and taught at the University of Illinois from 1939 to 1950, when she became the first woman with a Ph.D. in physics on the Brookhaven faculty.         Dr. Goldhaber founded the Brookhaven Lecture Series in 1960. She was a co-founder of Brookhaven Women in Science, which furthers the advancement of women scientists and began in 1979. She retired from Brookhaven in 1977 but returned in 1985 as a research collaborator, an association she continued until 1990.         Over the years, she was an adjunct professor at Cornell University and the Johns Hopkins University. She also was an adviser and consultant  at the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation and many other scientific bodies.         Besides her husband of 59 years, she is survived by two sons, both theoretical physicists, Dr. Alfred Goldhaber of Setauket, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Goldhaber of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Liselotte Leoni of Nice, France, and two grandchildren.         In 1984, the Phi Beta Kappa society selected her as a Visiting Scholar, an honor that sent her to eight campuses for the year. In an interview at the time with The New York Times, she said that her path into science had been clear because she fell in love with numbers at the age of 4 and decided to study physics and mathematics as a teen-ager in Munich.         She declined to settle for the future of a high school teacher, as other  girls with similar interests might have, or a lawyer, as her father wanted, she said.         ''I said, 'I'm not interested in the law,' '' she recalled. ''I wanted to understand what the world is made of. That actually turned out to be a good thing because when the Nazis came -- I'm Jewish -- I had to leave the country, and physics was something that could be done anywhere.''       
         Alice Hanson Cook, a Cornell University scholar, early feminist and longtime advocate of equal pay for women and support programs for working mothers, died on Feb. 7 at her home in Ithaca, N.Y., of complications from a stroke. She was 94.         Professor Cook began work at Cornell in 1954 and was associated with the university for almost two decades, specializing in labor history in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. She wrote extensively on issues dealing with women, unions, labor relations, sex discrimination and equal employment opportunities in the United States and abroad.         ''She was not only interested, but concerned in every aspect of the working woman's life,'' said Jennie Farley, a Cornell professor of industrial and labor relations. ''Alice  made it clear that these issues were universal in their importance and that they affected every woman no matter where she lived and worked.''         Her retirement in 1972 was marked with the establishment of Cook's Grove in a Cornell quadrangle, identified by a plaque that read ''Teacher, Feminist, First University Ombudsman.''         Speaking at a 1993 showing of ''Never Done: The Working Life of Alice H. Cook,'' a documentary film on her career, Professor Cook described her mother and grandmother as turn-of-the-century suffragists who had brought her up to believe that ''girls deserved education as much as boys.'' At the same event, she recalled the opening of the Cornell Faculty Club to women -- an event in which she played a pivotal role -- and her appointment as the university's first ombudsman.         The daughter of Flora and August Hanson, a peripatetic railroad accountant, Alice Hanson was born in Alexandria, Va., in 1903. She attended  Northwestern University, her mother's alma mater, where she was a co-founder of the student Liberal League to promote socialism, civil liberties and labor unions, and was involved in the Student League for Industrial Democracy.         She recalled that she and 37 fellow students had once identified themselves as pacifists who would refuse to fight in another war. They were branded ''the 38'' by The Chicago Tribune, she said, and described as ''a regretted presence at Northwestern.''         As she became increasingly active, she shared speakers' platforms with Jane Addams, the founder of Hull House in Chicago; worked in St. Louis with a social welfare agency, and taught at a cooperative farming community in Arkansas. After receiving her degree in 1924, she married Wesley Cook, a divinity student who later became involved in union activities. They were divorced in 1950.         Professor Cook's career spanned five spheres: social work, labor organization, labor education, foreign service and the academy. In the late 1930's, she left her job with the Y.W.C.A. in Philadelphia to organize textile workers. Later, she was associated in community affairs and education with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen, and the Marine and Shipbuilding Workers.         She was the visiting expert on labor education with the Office of Military Government in postwar Germany in the late 1940's, and chief of the Adult Education Section of the United States High Commission in Germany from 1950 to 1952.         She joined the extension division of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell in 1952 and two years later was invited by the dean to teach labor history.         Her autobiography, ''A Lifetime in Labor,'' completed shortly before her death, will be published this spring by Feminist Press of New York.         She is survived by two sons, Phillip Cook of Buffalo and Thomas Bernstein of Manhattan; two brothers, Frederick Hanson of Sun Lakes, Ariz., and Evanston, Ill., and Theodore Hanson of Honolulu; three grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.       
         Alice Marie Miel, an educator who was among the earliest to advance the notion that curriculum in the nation's classrooms should have a role in preparing children for the society they will enter as adults, died on Jan. 31 at the North Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville. She was 91.         Dr. Miel, a former resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, moved to Gainesville after retiring from Teachers College at Columbia University in 1971.         As a professor of education and an author who specialized in curriculum development, Dr. Miel (pronounced mile) taught and left her imprint on the subject throughout the country and around the world.         She taught and wrote that a good teacher was a student with the world as the classroom. She set forth that approach in more than 10 books and other writings, beginning with the 1946 classic, ''Changing the Curriculum: A Social Process'' (Appleton). It counseled ''group solidarity and heterogeneity'' in curriculum development or, as she put it, ''diversity within unity.''         She believed that teachers must inspire their students to creativity and awareness of society at large even as they teach the basics. Her concern was that too many American children were growing up without a clue to their country's social and racial diversity. It was a conclusion that most of her peers had yet to reach.         She promoted the concept that education should be a vehicle toward a world community and intercultural understanding, beginning at home. In the book ''More Than Social Studies'' (Prentice-Hall, 1957) she coined the term ''social educator,'' whose classroom becomes ''a particular setting in which children can experience democratic living.''         She had particular trouble with the way children were being reared in the white suburbs of the 1960's, which she wrote about in a four-year study published in 1967, ''The Shortchanged Children of Suburbia.'' She concluded that these children were  being deprived of the ''rich diversity of American life,'' never knowing an African-American or poor youngster their own age.         Born on Feb. 21, 1906, in Six Lakes, Mich., she graduated in 1928 from the University of Michigan, where she earned a master's three years later. She received her doctorate in education at Teachers College in 1944.         Her career started in Ann Arbor, Mich. She taught elementary and secondary school and became a principal. Before she arrived at Teachers College, she was the curriculum coordinator for the public schools of Mount Pleasant, Mich.         In 1945, she was appointed a professor at Teachers College and staff researcher at the Horace Mann-Lincoln Institute of School Experimentation. In 1960, she took charge of the college's department of curriculum and teaching, which deals with education programs from the nursery to the college level.         Four years before she took emeritus status, Teachers College established Project Milestone for a ''re-look, revitalization and a recommitment to the central themes'' of Dr. Miel's thinking.         Dr. Miel is survived by two brothers, Homer Miel of Stanton, Mich., and Lucas S. Miel of Destin, Mich.       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Margaret Hillis, who founded the Chicago Symphony Chorus and was the first woman to conduct the Chicago Symphony itself, died yesterday at Evanston Hospital, in Evanston, Ill. She was 76, and lived in Wilmette, Ill.         The cause was lung cancer, said Synneve Carlino, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Symphony.         Ms. Hillis, who appeared as a guest conductor with many American orchestras, including the National Symphony, the St. Louis Symphony, the Oregon Symphony and the Minnesota Orchestra, often said that orchestral conducting was her first love. She established herself as a choral conductor, however, because there were virtually no orchestral conducting opportunities for women when she began her career in the 1950's.         ''I learned to take a strong disadvantage and turn it to my advantage,'' she once said, and indeed, her work with the Chicago Symphony Chorus, as well as the choruses of the San Francisco Symphony and the Cleveland Orchestra, brought her considerable renown.         It also helped smooth her path to orchestral podiums. In 1957, when she started her chorus in Chicago, she made her conducting debut with the Chicago Symphony. She led the orchestra several times thereafter, both in Chicago and on tour         In 1977, she had a notable appearance as a last-minute substitute for Sir Georg Solti, who had fallen ill, in a performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony at Carnegie Hall.         Ms. Hillis was born in Kokomo, Ind., in 1921. She began studying the piano when she was 5, but said that by the time she was 8 she began dreaming of becoming a conductor. She studied music at Indiana University in Bloomington, but suspended her studies during World War II to become a civilian flight instructor in Muncie, Ind.         After she completed her bachelor's degree in 1947, Ms. Hillis moved to New York, where she studied choral conducting with Robert Shaw at the Juilliard School. She soon became Mr. Shaw's assistant at the Collegiate Chorale, and in 1950 she founded the Tanglewood Alumni Chorus, which later performed as the New York Concert Choir and Orchestra.         In the 1950's she also worked as a choral conductor for the New York City Opera and the American Opera Society. During her years in New York she taught choral conducting at the Juilliard School and Union Theological Seminary, and she formed the American Choral Foundation, an organization that sought to raise the standards of choral performance.         The conductor Fritz Reiner invited her to start a chorus for the Chicago Symphony in 1957, and within a decade she had established one of the finest professional choirs in the country.         She also began working with community and regional orchestras, and was director for several years of the Kenosha Civic Orchestra, the Chicago Civic Orchestra and the Elgin Symphony. Starting in the late 1970's, she worked more actively as a guest conductor.         Although the directors of orchestral choirs do most of their work behind the scenes, rehearsing their choruses for performances conducted by the orchestra's music director or a guest conductor, Ms. Hillis's work with the Chicago Symphony Chorus was widely praised. She received Grammy awards for nine recordings for which she prepared the chorus for Mr. Solti, among them a Verdi Requiem, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, two recordings of the Brahms German Requiem, Haydn's ''Creation'' and Bach's Mass in B minor.         Ms. Hillis is survived by three brothers: Elwood Hillis, a former Congressman, of Culver, Ind; Robert Hillis of Kokomo, and Joseph Hillis of Lafayette, Calif.         She had a sense of humor about her struggle for recognition in a profession dominated by men. ''There's only one woman I know who could never be a symphony conductor,'' she told The New York Times in 1979, ''and that's the Venus de Milo.''       
         Rene  de Epelbaum, a founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo human rights group and one of its most dynamic members, died on Saturday at age 77.         Her colleagues said she had suffered a heart attack.         In 1977, during its crackdown on leftists, the military dictatorship that ran Argentina at the time abducted her three adult children, Luis, Lila, and Claudio, and presumably killed them. Mrs. Epelbaum offered her home as a meeting place for mothers who had suffered the same plight.         Soon after, in open defiance of the junta, the group of mothers began holding weekly protests in the main Government square, the Plaza de Mayo. Today, the protests at the Plaza de Mayo are still held every Thursday as the elderly mothers don their trademark white head scarfs with the names of missing children scrawled in ink.         A Government commission found in the mid-1980's that at least 9,000 people had been killed or disappeared during the right-wing military Government's crackdown on political opponents. Human rights advocates contend that the number of victims was closer to 30,000.         Mrs. Epelbaum, who once taught literature, was a fearless, outspoken critic of the military Government. Her writings, speeches, and trips abroad helped earn the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo international acclaim. She also is credited with bringing worldwide attention to the atrocities of Argentina's military regime, which reliquinshed power in 1983.         ''I remember the first time she gave a press conference in Canada and spoke against the dictatorship,'' said Laura Bonaparte, another member of her group. ''They told her to be careful because she could be killed when she returned to Argentina. Epelbaum replied: 'What is important to me is what we do today, not what will happen tommorrow.' ''         Mrs. Epelbaum was greatly troubled by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision in 1989 to pardon senior military officers accused of human rights abuses. The democratically elected Government said the move was essential for national reconciliation.         ''It is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who violated human dignity and those who rose up against the constitutional order,'' Mrs. Epelbaum said.         Alfredo Bravo, an opposition Congressman whose party has proposed a bill to rescind the military amnesty, said of Mrs. Epelbaum, who leaves no immediate survivors, ''It hurts me deeply that as a Congressman, I have not been able to repair her pain, at least in part, with the abolition of these amnesty decrees.''       
         Elizabeth Barnes, a volunteer for national organizations including the Y.W.C.A. and National Council of Negro Women, died on Thursday at the Health Clinic of Westminster Shores in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 90 and a resident of St. Petersburg.         Mrs. Barnes, who had been a resident of New York City for many years, moved to Florida in 1996. Her son, Andrew Barnes, is the editor and chief executive of The St. Petersburg Times.         She worked for the council in the 1970's, writing biographies of successful black women. In the 1940's, she was on the Y.W.C.A.'s national board.         She also taught psychology at Sarah Lawrence College.         Her husband, Joe Barnes, a New York Herald Tribune correspondent in the 1930's and editor of The New York Star in the 1940's, died in 1970.         In addition to her son, she is survived by two daughters, Lila Jacobs of Minneapolis and Nancy Barnes of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Betty L. Santangelo, a retired teacher and school administrator who was long active in Italian-American and other civic affairs, died on March 15 at the home of a daughter in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 80 and formerly lived in the Bronx.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Santangelo was the widow of the former United States Representative, Alfred E. Santangelo, a Democrat of the Bronx and a strong voice for the Italian-American community. She shared his work in that area, and at her death she was the vice president and treasurer of the Italian Heritage and Culture Committee of the Bronx and Westchester.         Over the years she was active in Siamo (We Are), the Federation of Italian-American Educators and the National Italian American Foundation, of which her husband was a founder. She was an officer or board member of many charities, including the Italian Big Sisters, the Providence Rest Nursing Home and the Enrico Fermi Library and Culture Center branch of the New York Public Library in the Bronx.         She recently finished a 10-year labor of love: writing and assembling a book, ''Lucky Corner, the Biography of Congressman Alfred E. Santangelo and the Rise of Italian-Americans in Politics.'' Heavily illustrated, it is scheduled for publication later this year by the Center for Migration Studies.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1943. She taught at Benjamin Franklin High School in Manhattan, and she retired as an administrator at the College of New Rochelle in 1985.         She is survived by four daughters, Mary Jo Nocero of Orlando, Fla., Eileen Hult of Milwaukee, Betty J. Santangelo of Manhasset and Patricia A. Santangelo of Manhattan; a son, Charles A. Santangelo, of Washington; a sister, Rose Santangelo of Harrison, N.Y., and seven grandchildren. Her husband died in 1978.       
         Galina Ulanova, whose uncanny blend of unabashed emotionalism and lyrical restraint made her one of the greatest dancers of the 20th century, died here today. She was 88.         Revered in Russia from the moment she made her debut in Leningrad's Maryinsky Ballet in 1928, she riveted the Western world in 1956 when she traveled with the Bolshoi Ballet to London's Royal Opera House. There she astonished critics and fans alike with her performances as Juliet and Giselle.         Inspired by Prokofiev's score to ''Romeo and Juliet'' (one of three he wrote for the ballerina) and by the bold choreography of Leonid Lavrovsky, Miss Ulanova's dancing, and that of the Bolshoi, helped make the case after Stalin's death that Russian classical ballet remained the finest in the world.         ''The impact of the Bolshoi has been overwhelming,'' wrote John Martin, The New York Times's dance critic, when the company traveled for the first time to New York in 1959. ''And it will be something of a calamity if we ever allow ourselves to recover.''         Even with the advance publicity about the majesty of Miss Ulanova's role as Juliet, American critics found themselves astounded. ''To see a legend assume the dimensions of reality before us,'' Mr. Martin wrote about her dancing in ''Romeo and Juliet,'' ''and in the process lose nothing of the quality of legend, is a rare and wonderful experience.''         It was, however, an experience that Russian ballet fans were able to enjoy for decades. Galina Sergeyevna Ulanova was born in 1910 in St. Petersburg -- the home of Fokine, Balanchine, Petipa, Nijinsky and so many other legends of Russian dance. She was taught there by her mother -- who also danced professionally -- before entering the famous ballet school there.         She joined the Maryinsky Theater in 1928, the same year she completed her classical dance training, and she would live long enough to see it become the Kirov and then revert, when the Soviet Union dissolved, to its original name.         It was there that she made her name in Mr. Lavrovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' as well as in such classical staples as ''Swan Lake'' and ''Giselle.'' In 1944, Miss Ulanova was transferred -- reportedly after a personal request by Stalin -- to the Bolshoi in Moscow.         She danced with the Bolshoi until 1960, and for most of that time she was the company's and the Soviet Union's chief soloist.         Miss Ulanova performed most of the greatest roles in classical ballet, including the leads in ''Giselle,'' ''Swan Lake,'' ''Cinderella'' and ''Sleeping Beauty.'' Such was her power that when Mr. Martin criticized -- mildly -- her performance in ''Swan Lake'' during the 1959 New York tour, Pravda responded the next day by accusing him and The Times of being ''bent on continuing the cold war.''         Despite her star status -- and the tension that can cause -- Miss Ulanova was highly popular, eventually becoming a teacher to the greatest dancers -- including Yekaterina Maksimova, Nina Timofeyeva and the current Bolshoi director, Vladimir Vasilyev -- who followed her.         ''On many occasions people tried to push us into conflict,'' Maya Plesetskaya, who replaced her in 1960 as the Bolshoi's leading female dancer, wrote two years ago in her memoirs. ''It could never happen.''         Miss Plesetskaya had only praise for the woman whom she remembered seeing for the first time on the day in 1939 that Hitler's Foreign Minister, Joachim Von Ribbentrop, arrived in Moscow to sign the notorious pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. ''She was an angel and she danced like one,'' she wrote.         Few stars are able to handle the demands of dancing into their 40's, but Miss Ulanova -- who was 49 when she struck New York like a thunderbolt -- was one of them. Still, she often vowed that she would retire when she was 50 and she did. Unlike most of her contemporaries, who return frequently into their dotage for special performances, Miss Ulanova then devoted the rest of her life to teaching.         She received nearly every medal  the Soviets bestowed on their most accomplished citizens, including the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Award.  Although she tried to remain politely uninvolved in party politics -- always an impossibility at the time -- she was twice named a Hero of Socialist labor.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, recovering at his dacha from his most recent illness, issued a statement today praising Miss Ulanova as a rare Russia genius.         ''She was the greatest ballerina of the 20th century,'' he said. ''Her life and the art of dance to which she has give her soul has become part of Russian and world culture. Ulanova has always been for us the symbol of conscience, honor and dignity. She was a true artist.''       
         Hilda Morley, an American poet who gained wider recognition late in life, decades after she first published her imagist free verse, died on Monday at Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. A former resident of Sag Harbor, N.Y., she was 81 and had moved to London last year to continue work on a biography of her late husband, the avant-garde composer Stefan Wolpe.         The cause was liver failure after a fall at home, said a spokeswoman for her publisher, Moyer Bell.         Ms. Morley published five books of poetry in which she articulated emotions and feelings in free verse, but a type of verse as measured as dance  or music. She was a ''master of that ability,'' Robert Creeley, a fellow poet, said.         She wrote that her poetry was shaped by the visions of Abstract Expressionism, which can create metamorphoses. Artists like Klee and Picasso, she said, gave her the means to create word canvases depicting the world around her.         Born Hilda Auerbach in Manhattan, Ms. Morley considered herself an inhabitant of the world. She was educated in New York, Haifa (in what was then known as Palestine), London and at Wellesley College, Ohio State University and New York University.         Along the way she taught English at a private school in England and at Walden School in New York, where she also worked as a researcher for the Zionist Youth Commission and as a Hebrew translator for the Office of War Information.         Starting in the 1940's, she intermittently lectured at Rutgers University. After her marriage in 1952, she taught English literature at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Once recognized as a poet, she took academic assignments, lecturing, leading poetry workshops and judging poetry. She was a resident poet at Northeast Missouri University in 1992.         Ms. Morley is survived by a stepdaughter, Katherina Wolpe of London.         The first collection of her previously published poetry was ''A Blessing Outside Us'' (1976). It was followed by three others that remain in print: ''What Are Winds and What Are Waters'' (1993), ''To Hold in My Hand: Selected Poems, 1953-83'' (1984) and ''Cloudless at First'' (1988).         Her final collection was ''The Turning,'' which has just been published. It includes ''Fiesta, Ibiza,'' her evocation of a place she savored:         Warm crystal         of my little         city;         the fishes         swim over the bay,         rooftops swooping         with light,         the wreaths & garlands         bursting gently         in night's element,         the sunlit branches         exploding         softly,         the sea baring         its lights         burning         the unshadowed joys       
         Eleanor C. Lambertsen, a leader in American nursing education who introduced the concept of team nursing for better patient care, died on March 30 at Waverly Heights, a nursing home in Gladwyne, Pa. She was 82 and a former resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was Parkinson's disease, according to Teachers College of Columbia University, where Dr. Lambertsen headed the department of nursing education from 1961 to 1970 and taught doctoral courses on nursing leadership into the late 1980's.         Dr. Lambertsen started her career in the 1930's as a bedside nurse at Overlook Hospital of Nursing in Summit, N.J. The idea of team nursing sprang from her doctoral dissertation, and in the decades afterward, the concept made her a mentor and teacher to generations of health professionals around the world.         ''The purpose of team nursing,'' Dr. Lambertsen wrote in her dissertation, ''is to blend different kinds of nurses into the working unit whose core is the patient and his individual nursing needs.''         She devoted her career to converting nurses, doctors and hospital administrators to the concept. As nurses and nurse executives followed her lead, she worked to uphold high educational standards and to raise the esteem in which nurses were held.         The teams she envisioned were led by doctors and experienced nurses who coordinated the work of physical and occupational therapists, social workers and others. She also took the concept to classrooms and hospital wards in this country and overseas as a consultant to governments and nursing organizations she helped to inspire.         A native of Fanwood, N.J., she graduated from Overlook Hospital in 1938 and rose to director of the school of nursing services there in 1945. She received her bachelor's (1949), master's (1950) and doctoral degrees (1957) in education from Teachers College.         Her dissertation spelled out her idea of team nursing, and it was published as a book by Teachers College Press under the title ''Nursing Team Organization and Functioning.'' The dissertation led to a demonstration project at Francis Delafield Hospital, a cancer hospital in Manhattan.         The demonstration attracted administrators from across the country who sought to reorganize their nursing staffs according to Dr. Lambertsen's team concept.         In the previous system, called functional nursing, one nurse delivered medication, another bathed patients and so forth.         Dr. Lambertsen's plan called for registered nurses to work closely with doctors to oversee patient care and treatment goals and to coordinate nurses' roles. Daily nurse conferences were held to review care plans and arrange the duties of licensed practical nurses, therapists and other aides.         The American Nurses Association honored Dr. Lambertsen in 1984 for originating the concept of team nursing. It also praised her role as principal investigator in studies that advanced nursing education and documented the need for the proper training of nurses facing greater professional responsibilities.         The association cited her ''pioneering efforts'' to promote the nurse practitioner movement and the nurses' role in delivering primary care. It also praised her efforts to improve the nurses' relationship with other health care professionals. Four years ago, Dr. Lambertsen endowed a research program of the American Nurses Foundation.         In 1970, she was appointed dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing. In 1974 she became senior associate director of nursing at the hospital, and she held that position for a number of years.         Her husband, Dr. Joseph Anderson, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by two brothers, Herbert and Dr. Christian Lambertsen, both of Irvington, N.J.       
         Frances B. Sonz, a retired painter and art teacher in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., died on April 12 at her home in Tiburon, Calif., where she had lived for 10 years. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Sonz grew up in New York City and earned a degree in fine arts from the Pratt Institute. She also earned a master's degree in teaching at New York University.         She exhibited her work at Manhattan galleries and won first place in a juried show in 1966 at the Salmagundi Club, the nation's oldest sketch club, when she became the first woman to receive the club's President's Award. Her prize winner was a pastel still life.         She taught art at Dobbs Ferry High School until 20 years ago and continued her painting in the San Francisco Bay area until last December.         Mrs. Sonz is survived by her husband, Ben Sonz Sr.; a daughter, Ann Mantranga of Sausalito, Calif.; two sons, Benedict Sonz Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Paul Sonz of Mill Valley, Calif.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.       
         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         P. W. Manchester, a Britain-born critic with wide-ranging interests who edited important dance magazines in London and New York, co-edited a dance encyclopedia and taught dance history, died on Monday at Deaconess Hospital in Cincinnati. She was 91 and lived in Clifton, Ohio.         The cause was complications of a stroke, said Janet Light, a friend.         Miss Manchester disliked and never used her given name, Phyllis Winifred. She signed her reviews with her first initials and was known to friends and colleagues as Bill. Dance was her passion and she witnessed the final days of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the birth of the company that became the Royal Ballet and the formative years of the New York City Ballet.         She could also speak authoritatively on subjects like world literature, the British royal family and baseball, a sport she became devoted to after moving to New York in 1951. She even occasionally served as a radio sports commentator in Cincinnati, discussing baseball games in a refined British accent.         Miss Manchester came to the United States to work as associate editor and principal critic for Dance News, a monthly magazine, and, with its founder, Anatole Chujoy, co-edited  The Dance Encyclopedia, published in 1967. She also wrote dance criticism for The Christian Science Monitor during the 1960's.         Miss Manchester was born in London and worked there as a dance critic for Theater World magazine from 1941 to 1943.         She attracted widespread attention in 1942 with ''Vic-Wells: A Ballet Progress,'' a book appraising the company now known as the Royal Ballet. The work was considered so shrewd that Miss Manchester was often asked if she had personal connections to the company's staff. But at the time, she had none. That same year, however, she became directly involved with another troupe by serving as secretary to Marie Rambert, director of the Ballet Rambert.         Miss Manchester resigned in 1946 to found a monthly magazine called Ballet Today. Its success and her succinct prose led Mr. Chujoy to invite her to Dance News. When Mr. Chujoy died in 1969, he willed her his magazine. But she decided to sell it and accept an offer to teach at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, remaining there until she retired in 1993.         She also taught at the University of Utah and the North Carolina School of the Arts and was an adjudicator, arranging programs for regional ballet festivals.         Miss Manchester took an active part in Cincinnati civic life and for several years was host of a weekly radio dance program there. In 1975, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts enabled her to prepare a series of radio programs on dance history. She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1988.         She is survived by nieces and nephews in Britain and the United States.       
         Betsy Carden, a former dance teacher at Brooklyn College and a leader in American college dance, died on May 5 at her home in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said her family.         Born in Danville, Va., and educated at Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia and at New York University, Ms. Carden taught at Radford College in Virginia before coming to Brooklyn College in 1955. She was head of the Brooklyn College dance department when she retired in 1986.         Believing that colleges need to foster dance as a performing art, she was active in the American College Dance Festival Association from 1979 to 1990. She originated its scholarship program, helped develop its choreography series and supervised many college dance festivals. At her retirement from the association, she was its first executive secretary. She also was president of the American Dance Guild, 1973-75.         She is survived by her husband, John, of Chapel Hill; two sisters, Ardelle Morgan Carter of Lake Wales, Fla., and Mary Jane Martin Bright of Kinston, N.C., and five brothers, W. Ray Martin of Tucson, Ariz., and James T. Morgan, George G. Martin Jr., Robert H. Martin and M. Gene Martin, all of Danville, Va.       
         Dr. Emily Mudd, a onetime college dropout who trained to be a landscape architect before the trajectory of her life and her own inner fire led her to become a pioneering marriage and family counselor, died on Saturday at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 99 and widely regarded as a giant of the field she helped create.         At a time when more than 25,000 American marriage counselors treat some 2 million troubled marriages a year, it might seem a shade surprising that in 1933, when Mrs. Mudd helped form the Philadelphia Marriage Council, the field was so new there were only two other such organizations in the country.         There were also no established training programs for marriage counselors, which might help explain why her fellow organizers asked Mrs. Mudd to run the Philadelphia program even though she did not have an academic degree.         But she did have a few other credentials. For one thing, she and her husband, Stuart, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, had helped start Pennsylvania's first birth control clinic six years earlier, and her experiences there dealing with often overburdened and sometimes abused wives had led her to see the need for broader family counseling.         Then, too, Mrs. Mudd was the only wife and mother among the academics and social work specialists who met at the Mudds' home to plan the marriage council.         The men were so impressed with their hostess's drive, insights, intuition and commitment that after an elaborate search for a qualified professional, they decided she would be the best person to run the council. It certainly would have been hard to find anyone more dedicated to social change and human improvement.         As a student at Vassar when the United States entered World War I, she was so determined to do her part for the cause that she helped form a Vassar unit of the women's Land Army, established to have women work the fields in place of mobilized farmers.         Her own role in that unit and as a Vassar student came to an end when she drank some fetid water, developed typhoid fever and was advised to avoid stuffy classrooms and seek a career in the fresh air. Accordingly, she studied landscape architecture at a school in Groton, Mass., but before she could begin a career she was diverted by romance.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mudd spent a decade as her husband's unpaid laboratory assistant, first at Harvard, later at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, winning credit as co-author of 14 of his scientific papers.         After being asked to run the new Philadelphia Marriage Council, she returned to college. Working part time until she obtained a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Mudd, who eventually received her doctorate there, became the council's full-time executive director in 1936 and held the post until her retirement in 1967.         Along the way she helped lay the groundwork for virtually every aspect of professional marriage and family counseling. She formed one of the first counselor training programs, developed the first program to measure counselor effectiveness, wrote several textbooks and lectured widely here and abroad.         Only the third woman to be named to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, Dr. Mudd, who later became the first woman to become a full professor there, taught the first course at an American medical school dealing with sexuality, a speciality that led her to help edit Alfred Kinsey's book on female sexuality and to work closely with the Masters and Johnson clinic in St. Louis, to which she contributed thousands of case histories from her own practice.         After her retirement from the Philadelphia Marriage Council, now affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Mudd, who remarried after her first husband's death in 1975, continued to see patients well into her 80's. She also found time to pursue her old landscaping speciality by developing elaborate gardens at her suburban home.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Harvey, of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Margaret, of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Emily Mitchell of Concord, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Sybil Connolly, who designed the linen dress that Jacqueline Kennedy wore in her White House portrait and who elevated Irish style to high fashion, died on Wednesday at her home in Dublin. She was 77.         She had a heart attack, said a family member, John Connolly.         Miss Connolly, whose popularity spanned almost a half century, brought her collection to New York in 1953. She introduced gossamer hand-pleated handkerchief linen, which required nine yards of fabric to pleat into one yard; spidery Carrickmacross lace and a sophisticated palette of hand-woven Irish Donegal tweeds. She was an early exponent of soft and casual clothes when Parisian designers were featuring rigid construction.         ''I must see movement in a dress,'' she once said. ''A woman's body is inside. It breathes. It moves.''         Miss Connolly was an active designer until her death. For many years, most of her designs were sold in this country to Rockefellers, DuPonts and scores of other clients with  social names, many at private showings. She also received clients at her 270-year-old mansion on Merrion Square, one of the most fashionable areas of Dublin.         One of Miss Connolly's most unusual assignments was designing modern habits for three orders of Catholic nuns: the Sisters of Mercy of the United States and the Bon Secour and Marie Repatrice orders of Ireland.         Miss Connolly played an important role in the revival of Irish handicrafts, including crochet, handwoven woolens, basketwork and the development of fragrances. ''A shop window for Ireland'' was how she described her five-story headquarters.         She was often inspired by the clothes favored by rural Irish women. A hooded cloak worn in Kinsale was translated into an elegant velvet evening cape. An unbleached woolen yarn, knitted in different patterns and used in Aran Isles fishermen's sweaters, became an unusual sports outfit. Black Irish shawls and scarlet flannel petticoats were also adapted for more urban tastes.         In addition to her fashion collections, Miss Connolly designed fabrics and wallcoverings for Brunschwig & Fils and Schumacher, and crystal and china for Tiffany & Company. She wrote several books on Irish houses, gardens and crafts, and houses she decorated were featured in a number of magazines.         Miss Connolly was born in Swansea, Wales, on January 24, 1921, the  daughter of an insurance man originally from Waterford, Ireland, and a half-Welsh, half-English mother. She is survived by a sister, Judy Connolly of Dublin.         Her Welsh grandfather, a country squire and scholar, taught her Greek philosophy and private tutors coached her in other subjects. After her father's death, while she was still a teen-ager, she and her mother went  to Ireland, where her only formal education was two years in a convent school.         Her fashion career began in 1938 as an apprentice at Bradley's, a prestigious dressmaking establishment in London. Dowager Queen Mary was a client and Miss Connolly always recalled that at Buckingham Palace fittings ''I was allowed to hold the pins.''         She returned to Ireland in 1940 and joined a Dublin specialty shop as a buyer. Within a decade, she replaced the shop's designer, who had emigrated to the United States. In 1952 her career took a leap forward when a group of Philadelphia matrons, under the auspices of that city's Fashion Group, touched down in Dublin and discovered her.       
         Marjorie Lansing, a political scientist and sometime politician whose scholarly delineation of a gender gap in American voting patterns helped change the shape of political campaigns and spurred women into politics in the 1980's, died on May 1 at a hospital near her home in Ann Arbor, Mich. She was 82 and had been a professor of political science at Eastern Michigan University.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Though Dr. Lansing was not the first to investigate women's voting patterns, the issue received little serious attention until she published the first persuasive statistical evidence that women form a distinctive voting bloc.         The dominant view had been that if women did not mimic their husbands' voting patterns, their attitudes at least reflected the same mix of socioeconomic and ethnic factors, among others.         If it seems surprising that those quaint views survived into the 1970's, it must be at least partly because Dr. Lansing came late to scholarship.         A native of Geneva, Fla., Dr. Lansing, who was born Marjorie Tillis, graduated from the old Florida State College for Women in Gainesville, taught high school in Sanford, Fla., and made a life-changing trip to Europe.         Attracted to the political left since college, she raised money for the Spanish loyalist cause from fellow passengers on the voyage over, and after a heady tour of the continent returned to the United States eager to attend graduate school.         After receiving a master's in sociology from Columbia in 1940, she worked as a Government researcher in Washington and met and married a young economist named John Lansing. She set up housekeeping in Cambridge, Mass., while he completed his doctorate at Harvard and she plunged into the local leftist political scene, campaigning for Henry Wallace in the 1948 Presidential race.         A high-spirited woman with an engaging manner, Dr. Lansing made a powerful impact on at least one political associate. According to family legend, after a single political meeting in Boston, the actor Zero Mostel was so taken with Dr. Lansing that he followed her to a bus stop, pretended he was her abandoned husband and in an impromptu performance worthy of the Broadway stage made an impassioned plea that she return to him and their babies.         In 1949 the Lansings moved to Ann Arbor, where he became a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and she became active in the Democratic Party while rearing three children, studying for a Ph.D. in political science at Michigan and teaching at Eastern Michigan.         She is survived by two sons, Steve, of Ann Arbor, and Philip, of Boise, Idaho; a daughter, Carol, of Santa Barbara, Calif., and six grandchildren.         By the time she obtained her doctorate in 1970, Dr. Lansing had come up with the findings that would make her reputation in feminist political circles. But it had taken some doing. When she proposed as a doctoral dissertation a study that she expected would establish that women's voting patterns were significantly different from men's, her professors were so convinced there was no difference that they tried to discourage her.         She persisted, and the dissertation she turned in was essentially the same book she and a statistician, Sandra Baxter, published in 1980.         One reason for the delay between the dissertation and the book was that after her husband died in 1970, she concentrated on her teaching at Eastern Michigan while stepping up her political activities, unsuccessfully running for several offices, including a House seat.         She fared better as a scholar, analyzing a variety of political opinion and exit polls to establish that women's voting patterns were different from men's and that the differences were statistically significant.         To those who had assumed that women followed men's voting patterns, her most surprising finding was that the greatest sex difference was not on home-and-hearth issues like the economy and education but in foreign affairs, particularly military issues, with women being distinctly less hawkish than men.         Although dozens of similar studies have since been published, Dr. Lansing's work is still cited by scholars.         It is a measure of Dr. Lansing's prescience, if not of her influence, that three years after her landmark study, ''Women in Politics: The Invisible Majority,'' was published by the University of Michigan Press, a revised edition carried the subtitle, ''The Visible Majority.''         Correction:  June 27, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on May 11 about Marjorie Lansing, a political scientist, misstated the location of her alma mater, Florida State College for Women. The college, now known as Florida State University, is in Tallahassee, not Gainesville. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.       
         Mary Elizabeth Grenander, a longtime professor of English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce, known for his satirical wit and his horror stories, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne, N.Y. She was 79.         Professor Grenander, known as M. E. Grenander, taught at the State University of New York at Albany  from 1948 until she retired in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English. She was a former president of the New York American Studies Association.         Her many writings about Bierce, who was born in 1842 and went to Mexico in 1913 and vanished, appeared during more than two decades. Analyzing horror stories he wrote, she once said: ''The actual situation is harmful, with the protagonist conceiving it to be harmless and reacting accordingly.''         She edited and wrote the introduction for the book ''Poems of Ambrose Bierce'' (1995, Nebraska), which the literary journal American Notes and Queries, or ANQ, called ''a provocative volume'' that ''should spark further interest in Bierce.''         Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants from institutions including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the New York Council for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation.         She gave more than $1 million to SUNY Albany, including $500,000 to establish a professorship in memory of her husband, James W. Corbett, a  professor of physics at the same university, who died in 1994. Lisa James of the university's Office of University Relations said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered ''through long-term investments in the stock market.''         She was born in Rewey, Wis., and received bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate, all in English from the University of Chicago, in the 1940's.         Her marriage to Jean Louis Auclair ended in divorce. She married Professor Corbett in 1972.         She is survived by two sisters, Charlotte White of Puyallup, Wash.,  and Karen Hanley of Miami, Fla.       
         Lois Mailou Jones, an American painter and an art teacher for almost a half century at Howard University in Washington, died at her home in Washington on Tuesday. She was 92.         Ms. Jones was an iconic figure, and an important historic link in a path-breaking generation of black American artists. Her eclectic, academic work, in a career spanning nearly 70 years, ranged from impressionistic landscapes to political allegories, and from cubistic depictions of African sculptures to realistic portraits.         She was influential as a teacher, not only for her exacting standards and the encouragement she gave students, but as an example of persistence in a climate unfavorable to black and women artists.         Ms. Jones was born in Boston in 1905. Her mother was a beautician, her father a building superintendent who became a lawyer. In high school she took evening drawing classes at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and she had her first solo show at 17 on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. There she met the sculptor Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, one of the first artists to use black and African subjects positively, who encouraged her ambitions.         After graduate study in art and design in Boston, and then a stint teaching art at Palmer Memorial Institute in Sedalia, N.C., Ms. Jones joined the faculty of Howard University in 1930.         The next year, her work was included in the biennial exhibition of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. It was the first of several appearances at the Corcoran and in  other group shows, though Ms. Jones  said that early on she asked white friends to deliver her paintings to exhibitions, after having had an award rescinded when it was discovered that she was black.         In 1934, while attending a summer session at Columbia University, she was exposed to the cultural life of Harlem, and began studying the African masks that would become central to her best-known paintings.         In 1937, she received a fellowship to travel to Europe. She studied in Paris for a year and produced one of her most widely exhibited paintings, ''Les Fetiches'' (1938), an image of five African masks rendered in a  modernist style. The work has become an emblem of black American self-identity and is on view in the exhibition ''Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance'' at the Corcoran Gallery, where a small memorial show of the artist's work has been organized.         After marrying the Haitian artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel in 1953, Ms. Jones visited Haiti frequently, and in the 1960's and '70's she traveled in Africa. There she interviewed contemporary artists as part of a  project sponsored by Howard University titled ''The Black Visual Artists,'' for which she also documented the work of artists in the Caribbean and the United States. Both Haitian and African themes were crucial to her work.         Throughout these years, Ms. Jones taught at Howard University and elsewhere. She instructed generations of black artists, among them the contemporary sculptor Martha Jackson-Jarvis and the painter and collagist David C. Driskell, and some of whom, like Mr. Driskell, are also  teachers.         Ms. Jones retired as professor emeritus from Howard in 1977 but continued her career as an artist and lecturer, and exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia. In 1980, she was one of 10 Africa-American artists honored by President Jimmy Carter for outstanding achievement in the arts, and she received honorary degrees from several American colleges and universities. Her work is in numerous public collections, among them those of the National Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and the Museum of Fine Art.         Ms. Jones's husband died in 1982 and she has no immediate survivors.       
         Emily Whaley, a South Carolina woman with a green thumb and such an eye for color that she helped show flowering Charleston there was bloom beyond azaleas and camellias and turned her backyard into one of the nation's most acclaimed private gardens, died on Monday at her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C. She was 87 and had become something of celebrity since the publication of a memoir, ''Mrs. Whaley and her Charleston Garden,'' last year.         Her family said the cause was a stroke.         No one would mistake Mrs. Whaley's garden for, say, Longwood Gardens, but as home gardens go, the one she maintained for more than 50 years on a 30-foot by 100-foot plot behind her narrow 1754 white clapboard house at 58 Church Street, a block from the harbor in Charleston's historic district, has been a perennial eye-popper.         Among other things it has been featured in books by Rosemary Vaerey and other garden writers and has been a fixture on the Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tours.         The garden has been considered special partly because it was laid out in 1941 by a renowned landscape architect, Loutrell Briggs, who took full advantage of a brick carriage house, a couple of mighty oaks and a magnolia tree on neighboring properties as backdrops of opportunity for a design that included five distinct gardens, or ''rooms,'' as Mrs. Whaley called them.         But mainly it was because Mrs. Whaley filled the Briggs design with repeated flair, adding a statue here, ripping out a bed of plants there and forever experimenting with new plants in varied combinations.         That was not, to be sure, because she hadn't gotten it right the first time, but because her tastes changed every few years.         Until her book, billed as ''a conversation with William Baldwin,'' a  South Carolina novelist, was published by Algonquin Books last year, Mrs. Whaley's fame had been largely local, but well established.         One of the first local gardeners to dare to plant for year-round blooms in a city whose signature azaleas and camellias lose their blossoms in the torrid Charleston summers, Mrs. Whaley helped establish a trend of planting perennials like roses, gerbera daisies and hydrangeas, in front of the towering azalea and camellia shrubs.         She was also one of the first to open her garden to the public to raise money for charities, a practice that attracted some 3,000 paying visitors a year and led some to call her garden the most visited private garden in the country.         For Mrs. Whaley, an accomplished pianist and ballroom dancer who helped start the Cotillion, a dancing school that has become a Charleston social fixture, and once taught chess, gardening came more than naturally. It was, she liked to say, in her genes.         The daughter of a country doctor, Mrs. Whaley was born Emily Kershaw in Pinopolis, a village about 40 miles west of Charleston, and spent part of her childhood at her mother's family's Belvidere Plantation, helping her mother tend a 13-acre garden even as her mother had helped her mother garden.         After attending the University of Georgia she married Ben Scott Whaley, who became a prominent Charleston lawyer, served a term in the state legislature, was United States Attorney for Charleston in the Truman Administration and played a crucial role in creating his wife's garden.         With his wife confined to bed during a difficult pregnancy in the summer of 1941, Mr. Whaley asked if there was some special present she would like. She said yes, a garden designed by Loutrell Briggs.         It took a few years for Mrs. Whaley to turn the Briggs blueprint into an actual garden, but once she got it growing, she did not neglect it.         Working for several hours a day with her longtime assistant, Junior Robinson, she was a demon for pruning, a necessity in such a small garden with narrow brick walks.         Mrs. Whaley was not sentimental about her plantings. Let a row of Italian cypresses grow too tall for her tastes and whack, they would be gone.         A woman so attuned to the subtleties of nature that she was forever commenting on the weather and could become ecstatic over the feel of a gentle breeze on the back of her neck, Mrs. Whaley, if her book can be trusted, seemed comfortable speaking in epigrams.         A secluded garden bench, for example, was ''a place to invite your soul for a visit.''         For all her love of gardening, it was hardly her only love or her only talent. She also, its seems, had a way with the stove.         In October, Algonquin is bringing out a second Whaley collaboration with Mr. Baldwin, a book of recipes and family stories, ''Mrs. Whaley Entertains.''         Mrs. Whaley, whose husband died in 1987, is survived by three daughters, Emily Whipple, Anne Le Clercq and Martha Adams, all of Charleston, and seven grandchildren.       
         Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five  million copies, died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris. She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ''I Know How to Cook.''         In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain ring of defiance, and no wonder.         Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the restrictions from the beginning.         If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen.         Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.         She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline.         By her own account Miss Mathiot  garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't and bowed to her family's wishes.         After she established a life and career away from her family, the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them, she said, though for reasons of her own.         If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine.         While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science, including advances in nutritional understanding.         When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down, Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot, who said yes.         Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.         In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.         Like ''The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ''I Know How to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.         A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate survivors, never took anything for granted.         Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment, would have one more instruction: turn off the oven.       
         Catherine Kennedy, who after a  long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.         Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.         She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against  financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome  great odds.         After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.         But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.         The Governor was persuaded and,  with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.         In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall,  when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.         Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.         She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967.  Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.         It was through her affiliation with  Yale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in  AIDS medication and treatment.         Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half  of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival.  Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.         ''She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ''And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''       
         Elaine Aiken, a Method acting teacher, former member of the Actors Studio and a founder and director of Actors Conservatory in Manhattan, died on July 12 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, said Lily Lodge, the other founder and director of Actors Conservatory.         A teacher who worked with such actors as Harvey Keitel, Alec Baldwin, Shelley Winters and Brooke Shields, Ms. Aiken was known for her ability to allay a student's fears with her relaxation techniques. While she could be a strict taskmaster, she could get an actor to slow down, control his breathing and find the confidence to convey his own vulnerability onstage.         Ms. Aiken was born Elena Arizmendi in Cordoba, Spain, and came to New York with her parents during the Spanish Civil War. She began studying with Lee Strasberg in 1951 and joined the Actors Studio three years later, exercising considerable influence as a member of its auditions panel as well as through her directing abilities.         She was a Strasberg protegee, said Ms. Lodge, who added that Strasberg counted her among the few people he considered able to carry on his work as a teacher.         From 1977 to 1984 she taught acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, and she founded Actors Conservatory with Ms. Lodge in 1987. She acted on television, onstage and in films, including a 1957 western, ''The Lonely Man,'' with Anthony Perkins and Jack Palance.         She also appeared in the movie ''Caddyshack'' (1980) and had parts onstage in a 1975 revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' directed by George C. Scott and in ''Cages'' (1963) by Lewis John Carlino.         She is survived by a son, Robert Aiken of Washington; a sister, Carmen Zincke of Madrid; a brother, Henry Arizmendi of Tenafly, N.J., and three granddaughters.       
         Betty Lehan Harragan, a writer, consultant and advocate for women's equality in the workplace, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was lung cancer, according to Kathleen Harragan, her daughter.         Betty Harragan's book ''Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for Women'' was published in 1977 by Rawson Associates; since then, more than one million copies have been published in paperback by Warner Books. The book is used in college undergraduate courses and business schools and was the basis for a television film of the same name starring Loretta Swit and Sam Waterston, broadcast by CBS in 1982 and 1985.         Another book by Ms. Harragan, ''Knowing the Score: Play-by-Play Directions for Women on the Job,'' was published by St. Martin's Press in 1983. Ms. Harragan also wrote articles and columns about careers for such magazines as Working Woman, Woman's Day, Mademoiselle and Savvy.         A 27-year member of the National Organization for Women, for which she frequently handled publicity and public relations, Ms. Harragan often addressed professional societies and seminars for female managers. She also testified before legislative committees on behalf of equal opportunity, equal rights and comparable pay for women.         A native of Milwaukee, she graduated from Marquette University in there in 1944. She received a master's degree in English literature in 1947 from Columbia University.         From 1950 to 1956, she edited employee publications for the New York Telephone Company and was a writer and publicist at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency from 1963 to 1972. Later that year, Ms. Harragan started Betty Harragan & Affiliates, a consulting company that specialized in women's issues in the workplace.         Her husband, David J., died in 1962.         In addition to her daughter, Kathleen, of Boston, she is survived by three brothers, Robert Lehan of Tempe, Ariz.; Richard Lehan of Sacramento, Calif., and William Lehan of Anaheim, Calif.; two sisters, Geri Pollack of North Hills, Calif., and Judy Ascasio of Laguna Hills, Calif., and a grandson.       
         Gisella Caccialanza, a major American ballerina with George Balanchine's first New York company and with the San Francisco Ballet, died on Thursday in Seton Hospital in Daly City, Calif. She was 83 and lived in San Bruno, Calif.         The cause was a stroke, said Diane Kounalakis, associate director of public relations for the San Francisco Ballet.         Although Miss Caccialanza danced with pioneering American companies and was married to Lew Christensen, an important American choreographer, her early training was Italian.         Born of Italian-American parents in San Diego, she studied ballet in Los Angeles with Giovanni Rosi, an Italian teacher. Italian ballet training was prized at the time, and Rosi recommended that she continue her studies in Milan, Italy. Yet he lamented that Enrico Cecchetti, Italy's most celebrated teacher, had just died.         When Miss Caccialanza and her mother arrived in Milan in 1925, they were astonished to find Cecchetti still alive. Miss Caccialanza became his protegee and he served as her godfather at her confirmation. ''Letters From the Maestro,'' a collection of their correspondence, was published in 1971.         After returning to America in 1928, she worked with Albertina Rasch, a Viennese choreographer who staged ballet numbers for musicals and vaudeville shows. In 1934, she became a charter member of the American Ballet, Balanchine's first American company, creating parts in many works, notably that of the bride in Balanchine's ''Baiser de la Fee'' in 1937. She also danced in ''The Goldwyn Follies'' and ''On Your Toes,'' movie musicals choreographed by Balanchine.         When the American Ballet was not performing, its members appeared with Ballet Caravan, a touring group founded in 1936 that encouraged American choreographers, among them Mr. Christensen, whom Miss Caccialanza married in 1941. That year, the American Ballet and Ballet Caravan combined for a Latin American tour. For this organization, which disbanded shortly after the tour, Miss Caccialanza was cast as the Second Ballerina in the premiere of Balanchine's ''Ballet Imperial.''         She was guest ballerina with the San Francisco Ballet in 1943. In 1944, she danced the Sugarplum Fairy when that company presented America's first complete ''Nutcracker.'' Her partner was Willam Christensen, Lew's brother and the company's director.         Back in New York, Miss Caccialanza joined Ballet Society, the forerunner of the New York City Ballet, in 1946 and created the Third Theme in Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' When Willam Christensen left California in 1951 to found Ballet West in Salt Lake City, of which he is now director emeritus, his brother  succeeded him in San Francisco. Miss Caccialanza danced with his company until the birth of their son in 1953. She then taught at the company's school.         Her husband died in 1984. Miss Caccialanza is survived by her son, Chris Christensen, a conductor, also of San Bruno.       
         Edith Appleton Standen, one of the world's leading authorities on tapestries and a longtime curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died last weekend at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. Standen's writings, which include an award-winning, two-volume catalogue of the Met's European post-medieval tapestries, helped broaden the interest in her speciality, which was one she never set out to have. When the Met's director offered her a curatorial position in charge of its Textile Study Room in 1949, she said yes, but added that he should know three things: she didn't know much about textiles; she cared less than most women about fashion, and she never used a needle and thread unless she had to. The subject took: until a month ago, she was at the Metropolitan every day at 9 A.M., said Thomas Campbell, an associate curator.         She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of a British Army officer, and spent her childhood in Ireland and England. She received an honors degree in English from Somerville College, Oxford University, in 1926, and immigrated to the United States two years later. In Boston, she went to work for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, founded by William Sumner Appleton, her uncle.         She is survived by a sister-in-law, Lisl Standen.         Ms. Standen also did volunteer work for the photo collection of Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. She was invited to take the legendary museum course taught by Paul J. Sachs, the Fogg's associate director. In 1929 she was hired by Joseph Widener as secretary to his art collections. This position lasted until he gave the works to the National Gallery of Art in 1942. With World War II  under way, Ms. Standen became an American citizen and joined the Women's Army Corps, ending up in Ohio working for the Air Force. In 1945, she was sent to Europe as a member of the American Military Government's Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, the group that preserved, restored and returned art plundered during the war to its rightful owners. In early 1946, she took over management of the Weisbaden Collecting Point.         Ms. Standen, who remained single all her life, worked at the Met until 1970, organizing exhibitions and writing and lecturing on textiles and paintings. Besides her 1985 catalogue, ''European Post-Medieval Tapestries and Related Hangings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' she published more than 50 articles.         After her retirement, she remained a consultant to the Met until 1988. In 1986, she began to compile a biennial newsletter about tapestries, which she distributed in the academic world. She had just completed her final article, about Beauvais tapestries, which Mr. Campbell said was to be published posthumously in the Metropolitan Museum Journal. Her archives and books are expected to be left to the Metropolitan.       
         Bertha Boschwitz Leubsdorf, a volunteer and philanthropist who endowed the Karl and Bertha Leubsdorf Gallery at Hunter College, died on July 17 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 90.         A native of Berlin, she moved to New York as a girl and graduated from Hunter in 1929. She taught for a time at the Dalton School, Hunter College High School and Hunter College.         She married Karl Leubsdorf, an investment counselor, in 1934.         She endowed the gallery at Hunter in the mid-1980's in memory of her husband, who died in 1977. She is survived by two sons, Carl, of Washington, where he is the bureau chief of The Dallas Morning News, and John, of Manhattan, a law professor at Rutgers University, and three grandsons.       
         Lillian Hoban, who illustrated or wrote more than 100 children's books, including those featuring a badger named Frances and a chimpanzee named Arthur, died on July 17 at New York and Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and in Wilton, Conn.         The cause was heart failure, said her principal publisher, HarperCollins Children's Books.         Ms. Hoban's best-known works explored the trials and tribulations of early childhood. She first established herself as an illustrator in the 1960's, providing the drawings for the ''Frances'' series written by her husband, Russell Hoban, a prolific author of children's books. She illustrated his ''Baby Sister for Frances'' (1964) and drew the pictures for five more books in that series about Frances and her family.         After the couple divorced in 1975, she began writing and illustrating an ''I Can Read Books'' series about Arthur and his little sister, Violet. An 11th title, ''Arthur's Birthday Party,'' is due out early next year.         Born in Philadelphia, Lillian Aberman Hoban attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, studied dance with Martha Graham and taught modern dance in New York and Connecticut. She also danced on television during the 1950's.         She taught herself to draw still lifes, using crayons and pastels, and started writing stories after she had her own children, basing her tales on their everyday adventures.         Ms. Hoban is survived by three daughters, Phoebe, and Julia, both  of Manhattan, and Esme, of Wilton; a son, Brom, of Austin, Tex.; a sister, Esther Man of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.         Ms. Hoban was active in civic affairs in Wilton, particularly at the Wilton Library.         She also played a prominent role in the National Arts Club's creative writing program for public-school children, hoping to whet their taste for reading and writing.         ''When I am writing, I like writing best, and when I am drawing, I like drawing best,'' she once said. ''But probably what I like better than anything is just messing around with color.''       
         Corinne Greenberg Levin, an advocate for children and the director of the independent Teacher Center in New Haven since its founding 27 years ago, died on July 27 at Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. A New Haven resident, she was 68.         The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed in September 1996, her family said.         A former teacher, Ms. Levin organized the center in 1971 to be governed entirely by teachers, beyond the sway of unions or district administrators. It offers evening workshops bringing together teachers, parents and others interested in the subject at hand.         Ms. Levin focused on honing the performance of teachers in the classroom, improving curriculums and other matters important to the profession as well as the pupils in public, private and parochial schools. Her center attracted participants from southern Connecticut and beyond.         She was active in the teacher center movement nationally, and her center in New Haven served as a model for others. In the last few years, she also helped establish 13 similar teacher centers in Eastern Europe under the aegis of the Soros Foundation and the United States Information Agency.         Ms. Levin was born in New York City. She was a 1951 sociology graduate of Syracuse University, earned a master's degree in social-studies education at Harvard University and completed a program in school administration at New York University in 1968.         She taught in public schools in Maine, Pennsylvania and Connecticut before opening the Teacher Center. She was active in civic affairs, the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union.         Ms. Levin is survived by her husband, Dr. Lowell S. Levin; three daughters, Brooke A. Levin of Oakland, Calif., Jill S. Levin of Albuquerque, N.M., and Lori Levin Albert of New Haven; her mother, Estelle Greenberg of Warwick, R.I., and five grandchildren.       
         Mildred Elizabeth Buller Smith, who cut a singular swath through the 20th century by, among other things, picking apples and digging potatoes for the Women's Land Army in World War I, riding herd on New England milk prices for the Office of Price Administration in World War II and becoming a Connecticut television celebrity as a consumer price specialist, died on Aug. 12 at a nursing home in Hartford. She was 99, and it seems almost beside the point to note that she had been an agricultural economist for the University of Connecticut.         To say that Miss Smith followed her own path would hardly do justice to someone who became a farm specialist after growing up on the streets of Chicago.         But Miss Smith, who spent several girlhood summers on a farm, was ever an original, one whose career included driving a hotel jitney in Florida, starting and running the country store for Henry and Clara Ford's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Mass., and creating and starring in ''Millie's Market Basket'' on Connecticut television.         Never one to be hampered by convention, Miss Smith went to work for the agriculture department of the Connecticut Agricultural College before she received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago; became an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut (as the agricultural college became in 1938)  before she received a master's degree from Radcliffe College, and never did bother to get a doctorate, although she did complete postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.         For someone born in the Victorian era, Miss Smith adapted well to 20th-century culture, much to the occasional dismay of her mother, a staid woman who had derived her Victorian outlook in situ, growing up in  England, and who was properly shocked when her daughter, who had not come of age in the Roaring Twenties for nothing, would go off for weekends with her young man of the moment.         (Miss Smith, whose romantic life  became a subject of intense speculation among her grandnieces and grandnephews, apparently found a satisfying solution to the problem of juggling job and family: attracting a steady supply of smitten suitors without actually succumbing to matrimony. She derived enormous delight a few years ago when she received a proposal from an admirer at her Hartford retirement community on the very day the Social Security Administration notified her that she had died -- as, it turned out, another Mildred Smith had done.)         Miss Smith's sense of personal mission began early. With three of her four older brothers serving in the military in World War I, she was so eager to do her part that, ignoring her mother's objections, she dropped out of the University of Chicago to enlist in the Women's Land Army, a paramilitary organization that sought to fill the vacuum left by mobilized farm workers.         Typically, Miss Smith, who had a lifelong fascination with statistics, not only picked apples and dug potatoes on a farm in East Corinth, Vt., but counted them, computing yields and other data for reports that she later deposited with the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe.         After the fall harvest one year, the farmer whose land she had worked tried to find her a winter job at a resort that his friend Henry Ford owned in Eustis, Fla., but wondered whether Miss Smith knew how to drive, a requirement for the job of shuttling guests to and from the train station.         In a reply that later delighted her grandnieces and grandnephews, Miss Smith reassured him: ''I've been driving tractors since I was 12.''         Indeed, Miss Smith did so well as a jitney driver that she apparently impressed Ford and his wife, Clara. In 1923, when they bought the inn made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they recruited Miss Smith to start and run the country store that became a part of the historic restoration and preservation project.         By 1931, Miss Smith had found her life's work in academia, but after a decade as a statistician and consumer price specialist at the University of Connecticut, she decided that it was time to complete her own college education.         So, again flouting convention, she returned to Chicago and received her degree at age 42.         Later, after becoming an assistant professor in 1943 and spending three years with the O.P.A.'s Boston office, she received a master's degree from Radcliffe.         She remained an assistant professor, but her work as a teacher and consumer marketing specialist -- among other things turning out pamphlets and conducting radio and television programs stressing thrift -- was so impressive that when she retired in 1961, she was named professor emeritus.         In retirement Miss Smith wrote historical pamphlets on New England agriculture and taught herself bookbinding, selling leather-bound notebooks and other items at craft fairs to finance her yen for travel, which included 18 trips to England and the Continent, where as a young woman, it should come as no surprise, she had climbed the Matterhorn.       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.       
         Jean Fair Mitchell, a violin-playing, jig-dancing Scottish-born educator who guided the venerable Brearley School for girls from the white-glove 1940's through the armband 1960's without missing a beat, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 88 and had been the Brearley headmistress from 1947 to 1975.         Brearley, or the Brearley as it tends to be known by those who have trod its halls at 83d Street and the East River, has been a forward-looking New York institution since it was founded in 1884 to provide an education for the intellectually gifted daughters of the New York elite.         And by Miss Mitchell's time, its modern character had largely been set by her redoubtable predecessor, Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose departure in 1947 created the opportunity for a remarkable academic trade, one in which Brearley sent Mrs. McIntosh to Barnard College to become dean (and eventually president) and Barnard dealt Miss Mitchell, a member of its English faculty, to Brearley as headmistress.         For all the high-spirited comment it occasioned, the swap was largely a coincidence. After scrutinizing 75 candidates in a five-month search for Mrs. McIntosh's successor, the Brearley trustees announced that Miss Mitchell had been the board's first choice.         If her first decade or so presented few challenges in an era that is, after all, recalled as the quiescent 1950's, Miss Mitchell, a short, husky woman of verve who declaimed the poetry of Robert Burns in authentic dialect and Scottish burr, wasted little time in putting her own stamp on the school. Brearley had made social history by welcoming Jewish students as early as the 1880's, but Miss Mitchell promptly advanced its commitment to social diversity by recruiting its first black students, an effort aided by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to provide scholarships for needy minority students.         She also left her mark on Brearley students. For a woman who had such an austere public persona that girls would sometimes quake before being sent to her office for discipline, Miss Mitchell proved to be a pussycat in private, a warm and understanding woman who seemed to identify with troublemakers, perhaps because as a schoolgirl she had been one herself.         A native of Kirkcaldy, a Scottish town known less for its heather, she liked to point out, than for a large linoleum factory, Miss Mitchell was apparently such a hell-raiser during her school days that when she became headmistress at Brearley, the headmaster of her former school congratulated her as a ''poacher turned gamekeeper.''         Miss Mitchell, who would sometimes tell horror stories about the corporal punishment girls endured at Scottish schools, came away with such an aversion to punishment of any kind that she became famous at Brearley for her reluctance to suspend even the most recalcitrant troublemakers.         Her identification with the aspirations, frustrations and occasional fractiousness of the young was so complete that when the 1960's brought a wave of youthful unrest and rebelliousness over the Vietnam War, she quietly defused the anger among Brearley students, granting upperclassmen, for example, a day off to participate in an antiwar demonstration.         While Brearley students were as rebellious as any teen-agers in the 1960's, Miss Mitchell tended to be so understanding and accommodating that she left the rabble-rousers with little to complain about. When, for example, students decided that Brearley's infamous blue tunic and skirt uniforms, which they had long complained made them look like pears, were symbols of regimentation and oppression, she allowed students to wear more or less whatever they wanted.         Miss Mitchell, who was credited with strengthening science and mathematics courses, also responded positively to student complaints that the Brearley curriculum was not relevant to modern society. But the changes she authorized, like allowing students to substitute Spanish for German and complete their Latin requirements before high school, did not reach the level of some 1960's academic silliness and left the tough core curriculum unscathed.         Miss Mitchell, who received a master's in English from the University of Edinburgh, trained to be a teacher, spent five years teaching at an Edinburgh girls school, then came to the United States in 1936 as a postgraduate fellow at Smith College. She later joined the Smith faculty and taught at Sarah Lawrence for a year before going to Barnard in 1944.         For all her devotion to education, Miss Mitchell, whose father was an engineer, came close to pursuing a music career. At the time she was offered her first teaching post, he was also offered a job as violinist with the Edinburgh Symphony.         She apparently chose education over music as a career because she knew she could always pursue her love of music on her own, as she did at Brearley, where she would play chamber music with students, and at her summer home (a converted one-room schoolhouse) in Blue Hill, Me., where she was deeply involved with the Kneisel Hall music school.       
         Annabelle Irwin, a retired Iowa State English professor who drew on her experience as a high school teacher in collaborating on an acclaimed series of books for young teen-agers, died Sept. 13 at a daughter's home in Des Moines. She was 82, and with Lee Hadley had formed the writing team known as Hadley Irwin.         Her daughter Sara Thompson said the cause was complications from hepatitis C.         When Mrs. Irwin and her young partner, Lee Hadley, also an Iowa State English professor, put their heads and names together in the early 1970's, their target audience was 12- to 16-year-olds, an age group known in the publishing trade as young adults.         Specializing in what are known as problem books, the women produced 13 Hadley Irwin titles for the McElderry imprint at Simon & Schuster.         The books dealt with serious themes in such detail that it is little wonder that Mrs. Irwin's children, who appear in various guises throughout the series, would want the world to know that their mother did not draw on their experiences in exploring problems like teen-age suicide (''So Long at the Fair''), alcoholism (''Can't Hear You Listening'') or racism (''Kim/Kimi''), let alone incest, the breakthrough subject of the 1985 Hadley Irwin book, ''Abby, My Love.''         But Mrs. Irwin really did not need her children as models. A native of Peterson, Iowa, Mrs. Irwin, whose maiden name was Bowen, grew up on a farm, majored in music at Morningside College in Sioux City and spent 30 years teaching, first music and later English, at a series of high schools in Iowa and Illinois.         By the time she returned to school at age 50 to pick up a master's degree at the University of Iowa and qualify for a college position, Mrs. Irwin, who joined the Iowa State faculty in 1969, had seen enough teen-agers to fuel her literary career.         In a collaboration in which she  took the lead in plotting and Ms. Hadley specialized in characters, Mrs. Irwin drew on the experiences of students she had taught in high school in developing the books' anguished themes.         Over a quarter of a century the women developed a sure-fire system, beginning their books during summer vacations at Mrs. Irwin's lakeside home in Lake View, Iowa, then revising them during the school year, sometimes sitting side by side at the same typewriter and finishing each other's sentences.         The novels won respect in the publishing industry, led to a couple of television movies and sold steadily in the United States, Europe and Japan, though not enough to make the authors wealthy.         The last Hadley Irwin book, ''Sarah With an H,'' which dealt with anti-Semitism, was published after Ms. Hadley's death at 60 in 1995.         Afterward Mrs. Irwin sought to carry on alone under the name Ann Irwin, writing an as yet unpublished  novel, ''The Wild Seedling.''         Mrs. Irwin, whose husband, Keith, died in 1994, is survived by two other daughters, Jane Croll of Des Moines, and Ann Bauer of Dubuque; a son, Rees, of Ames, and four grandchildren.       
         Francelia Butler, a late-blooming academic of such passionate, unorthodox ways that she has been credited with almost single-handedly transforming the study of children's literature from a stepchild of library science into a recognized academic discipline, died last Friday at a nursing home in Windham, Conn. A resident of Mansfield Hollow, Conn., she was 85 and had been a professor at the University of Connecticut.         When they hired her in 1965, it's a safe bet that the men who ran the English department at the University of Connecticut knew that Dr. Butler, a native of Cleveland who grew up in Elyria, Ohio, was a 52-year-old widow who had returned to school after her husband's death, received a doctorate in Renaissance literature from the University of Virginia just two years earlier and spent the intervening years teaching at the University of Tennessee.         It's an even safer bet that her Connecticut superiors did not know that in 1934, as a fresh Oberlin College graduate with a degree in the classics, Dr. Butler had gone to Washington to write a pamphlet for  an education association on ''The Brotherhood of Man.'' And that she had been swiftly dismissed from the project after overriding her boss's directive to go easy on Hitler lest she offend association members who agreed with Hitler's policies.         Or that she had been dismissed from her next job, as publicity director of a segregated Washington hotel, after letting black Oberlin alumni attend a banquet there.         Had they been aware of her record of ad hoc social activism, her superiors might have had second thoughts about relegating Dr. Butler, a small woman with a will of steel, to children's literature, a course so scorned by the Connecticut English faculty that it was known derisively as ''kiddie lit.'' Certainly her superiors would not have been as surprised as they were when Dr. Butler, sensing that the academic disdain for children's literature reflected a disdain both for children and for women as children's traditional caretakers and teachers, proceeded to turn the course into a platform for reform.         The faculty's sneers at her course were understandable. Although children's literature had been taught in American universities since the turn of the century, generally as part of the library science or education curriculums, it was a reflection of the subject's lowly standing that it had no academic association and no academic journal.         Dr. Butler swiftly made up for lost time. Among other things, she established the journal Children's Literature, helped to create the children's literature division of the Modern Language Association and served as a founding director of the Children's Literature Association in 1972.         Along the way Dr. Butler's own course became one of the largest and most popular at the University of Connecticut, in part because she turned it into something resembling a three-ring circus with a string of guest lecturers that included falconers, puppeteers, troubadours, Maurice Sendak, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno Bettelheim, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Big Bird and the Wicked Witch of the West (the actress Margaret Hamilton).         Some of her colleagues predictably complained that the course's success was based more on showmanship than scholarship, but Dr. Butler, many of whose students went on to to teach children's literature at other colleges, was no slacker as a scholar. She turned out reams of  papers, edited anthologies and in 1989 published ''Skipping Around the World,'' a study of international  jump-rope rhymes.         For all the acclaim she won, Dr. Butler chafed at what she saw as Connecticut's indifference or active opposition to her efforts to wrest children's literature from its vocational moorings and place it within the humanities.         When, by her account, her upstart Journal was actually banned from the University of Connecticut bookstore, Dr. Butler found another academic sponsor: Yale University. (Later, when Connecticut seemed to shun the annual Peace Games Festival she established to teach children conflict resolution through games that rewarded cooperation over competition, she moved it to Harvard.)         Although her male colleagues suggested that the university had been more supportive than she claimed, after her retirement in 1992 at the age of 79, Dr. Butler, who typically had led the campaign that overturned Connecticut's mandatory retirement at 70, transferred her journal and her papers to Hollins College in Virginia.         She is survived by her daughter, Ann Wandell of Windham; a brother, Bruce McWilliams of Little Deer Isle, Me; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Carol Kay, a professor of 18th-century literature and culture at the University of Pittsburgh, died on Sept. 12 at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 51.         The cause was aplastic anemia, said her husband, Jonathan Arac.         Ms. Kay wrote ''Political Constructions'' (Cornell University Press, 1988), which examined the political history, moral philosophy and fiction between the English civil war and the French Revolution. Claudia L. Johnson, a professor of English at Princeton University, called the book ''one of this generation's most important studies of 18th-century fiction.''         Ms. Kay graduated from Radcliffe College in 1967 and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1975. From 1973 to 1979 she taught English at Princeton. She held faculty appointments at Amherst College, at Washington University in St. Louis and at New York University. In 1989 she became an associate professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh.         Ms. Kay is survived by her husband, Mr. Arac, and by her brother, Jeffrey Kay of Takoma Park, Md.       
         Frances Hamerstrom, who discovered a passion for observing nature as a young girl in Boston and pursued that passion throughout a life spent mostly in Wisconsin, died on Aug. 29 at Edgewater Haven, a nursing home in Port Edwards, Wis. She was 90.         An author, conservationist and wildlife biologist, she died three days after her last foray into the grassy fields near her rural home in Plainfield, Wis., which she shared with a great horned owl that assisted her in attracting hawks.         Bought and preserved through her fund-raising campaigns, the grasslands near Mrs. Hamerstrom's home shelter some 2,000 greater prairie chickens. The species, similar to the grouse, was stabilized largely through Mrs. Hamerstrom's efforts after farming and other human activities had shrunk its native prairie habitat.         There on the prairie, she informally taught hundreds of visitors. Sometimes she would lead them to the nest of a kestrel, a type of falcon, where she would keep a baby bird warm inside her shirt until it was measured and banded. Then she would often load a mouse into a trap to toss it onto the road in hopes of catching an adult kestrel for banding.         Each April and May, her assistants, from Boy Scouts to businessmen, would sit inside a canvas blind before dawn, often in freezing weather, to watch the ritual spring displays of male prairie chickens, who emit a hearty booming sound like a kettledrum that is heard for miles in the still air.         At age 86, on a field trip in Peru to watch the black-collared hawk feed on fish, she broke a hip trying to reach a hunting area while traveling with a guide up a tributary of the Amazon. She was evacuated by canoe. Then, at 87, she went back to Peru and traveled up another river in an effort to observe indigenous hunters.         Among her 12 books was ''Harrier Hawk of the Marshes: The Hawk That Is Ruled by a Mouse,'' the result of her 25-year study of the relationship between the harrier and the vole. It was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1986.         Mrs. Hamerstrom and her husband, Frederick, met and married on the East Coast and then both attended the University of Iowa, where Mrs. Hamerstrom, always proud that she had flunked out of Smith College, received a bachelor's degree in 1935. They also both went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where they studied with the conservationist Aldo Leopold, the author of ''Sand County Almanac.'' Mrs. Hamerstrom received a master's degree there in 1940.         In the 1930's, Frances Hamerstrom was one of the first women to ''crash the barrier into the all-male wildlife research profession,'' said Dr. Ray Anderson, a retired professor at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. She also became a crack wing-shot with a Parker 20-gauge shotgun and wrote a book called ''Is She Coming, Too?'' about the hunting trips she had taken at her husband's side. Both of them worked for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Her husband died in 1990.         Mrs. Hamerstrom, who was born in Needham, Mass., is survived by two children, Elva Hamerstrom Paulson of Roseburg, Ore., and Alan Hamerstrom of Arnold, Md.; two granddaughters, and a brother, Putnam Flint of Weston, Mass.         To allocate her time, Mrs. Hamerstrom applied the ''Hamerstrom Rule of Thirds'': a third for the worthless red tape that your boss requires; a third for doing what is wanted of you; a third for doing exactly what you please.         She lived for 50 years in a house with no running water that had not been painted since the Civil War and had no heat aside from a few cast-iron wood-burning stoves. She only occasionally swept around the piles of turtle shells, snowshoes, wildlife gear, books and files, all of which served as evidence of what it was that pleased her.       
         Helen Soreff, a painter of subtly inflected Minimalist abstractions, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         Mrs. Soreff was born in Brooklyn in 1926. She earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts from the University of Georgia and studied at the Art Students League in New York before earning a Master of Arts from Long Island University.         She had her first solo exhibition in New York at the Phoenix Gallery in 1963 and subsequently exhibited at the Bertha Urdang Gallery and Condeso-Lawler Gallery.         She had been represented since 1988 by the M-13 Gallery in SoHo, where she had her most recent solo show in 1995.         Since 1988 Mrs. Soreff had taught in the liberal studies program at the Parsons School of Design.         She is survived by her husband, Stephen Soreff, and two sons, Alexander, of New York City, and Zachary,  of London.       
         Berenice Lipson-Gruzen, a pianist with a long international career, died on Sept. 3 in Bad Wiessee, Germany. She was 73 and lived in New York.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lipson-Gruzen won notice with her visit to China in 1981, recording the Chopin Second Piano Concerto with the Beijing Central Philharmonic. In New York, she performed at Alice Tully Hall, the 92d Street Y, Merkin Concert Hall and Weill Recital Hall. She taught at Cooper Union, the New School for Social Research, New York University and the City College of New York and gave private lessons.         Ms. Lipson-Gruzen was born in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She studied music, anthropology and psychology at Hunter College and made her piano debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1976.         She is survived by her son, Dimitri DeHarak of Montpelier, Vt., and her companion, James Keeler, who produced her recordings.       
         Georgianna Morris Crowther Kappes, a longtime teacher of history in private schools, died on Oct. 17 at Greenwich Hospital. She was 94 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.         Mrs. Kappes, known as Nancy, was born in Lutherville, Md., and graduated from National Cathedral School in Washington and Smith College. She returned to school to earn a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College in 1953 and taught at preparatory schools until retiring from the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in the late 1960's.         Her husband, Carl, died in 1962. She was a sister of the late Bosley Crowther, a film critic for The New York Times.         She is survived by a son, Carl H. Kappes 3d of Greenwich; two daughters, Ellen B. Kappes of Northeast Harbor, Me., and Karen C. Kappes of Holden, Mass., and four grandsons.       
         IN November 1939, shortly after Adolf Hitler touched off World War II, a British writer commented about the two World Wars: ''The last one was a soldier's war. This one is everybody's.''         ''And so it was,'' said an octogenarian, Ruth Kornblum, who lives in White Plains. She flew planes for the Army Air Forces in World War II and will mark another Veterans Day on Nov. 11.         Soon after Europe went to war in 1939, American men volunteered or were drafted as America prepared. But women went to war, too, going into factories, into desk jobs and into the military. Mrs. Kornblum, then Ruth Kupferberg of Eastchester, was one of them. At 25, she was single and a registered nurse. She first volunteered to join a military hospital unit but ended up as a civilian flier of military planes. The United States was still at peace early in 1941 when she was introduced to a man who operated a flying service at Little Ferry, N.J., and in the course of the friendship he taught her how to fly the company's seaplane.         The two most famous American women in aviation at that time were Amelia Earhart, who had disappeared in the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1939, and Jacqueline Cochran, who in 1953 became the first woman to break the sound barrier.         When Britain went to war, Ms. Cochran, an ambitious and daring woman, recruited 22 American female pilots to ferry warplanes in Britain. They flew Hurricanes, Mosquitos and Lancaster bombers from factories to Royal Air Force bases. Ms. Cochran once flew a bomber across the Atlantic to Britain on a lend-lease delivery.         When the United States entered the war, Ms. Cochran and the volunteers were ordered home. She made a pitch to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and to General of the Army Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, to get women involved in military flying to free men for combat air duty. There were already plenty of experienced female pilots; 500 of them belonged to the Women Flyers of America.         The Government moved slowly but finally arrived at a compromise. It gave the female fliers civil service status for what was really a military job -- ferrying planes around the country from factories to air bases and from one base to another. They eventually received uniforms that looked like officers' uniforms, wore wings and insignia that looked like officers' issue and had meals at the officers' mess at air bases. Like the men, they went through close-order drill every morning to make them march like a military group. But they were civilians under military jurisdiction. Ms. Cochran wanted officers' commissions for the female fliers, but there was pressure on Congress from thousands of civilian men who also wanted Army Air Forces commissions.         Mrs. Kornblum said that at the time her desire to learn to fly intensified and that she asked to be relieved of her enlistment in a military nursing group. She quit her nursing job and continued her flying lessons. Her objective was to attain the essential 35 hours of solo flying because Ms. Cochran, who was director of the newly organized Women's Airforce Service Pilots, had sent out a call for volunteers. As a result, 25,000 women applied, and Mrs. Kornblum was one of the 1,860 accepted as WASP's for training in April 1943. She switched from seaplanes to land planes and in winter even trained on planes equipped with skis.         The WASP's were trained at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Tex. Mrs. Kornblum and the other hopeful aviators paid for their own transportation to get there. They were in training for six months and got a $150 monthly salary, which was increased to $250 upon graduation. It was the same instruction given the male Air Corps recruits.         Mrs. Kornblum was in the sixth group to receive instruction. They studied meteorology, navigation, engines and the Morse code, and learned how to load cargo in a plane.         Searching her memory back 65 years, Mrs. Kornblum said: ''I really enjoyed it. Texans were friendly to us, inviting us to barbecues, and one rancher even sent over buffalo steaks -- remember, meat and a lot of other things were rationed.         ''We all had parachutes, and they taught us what to do if we had to bail out. However, we didn't actually make any practice jumps. Except for one girl. She got her induction to parachute jumping by mistake. ''She was flying solo in a single-engine, open-cockpit plane when she made a training spin that turned it upside down. She had neglected to tighten her seat belt and went flying into space. Luckily, she pulled the rip cord, like she had been trained, and came back to earth safely.''         Mrs. Kornblum continued: ''But, you know, you don't learn everything in class. I was flying a Cub from El Paso, Tex., to Rome, N.Y. -- an awfully long distance for a plane that flew 80 miles an hour. I had no instruments, just a compass, and I had to go over a 9,000-foot-mountain. And it was cold because we had open cockpits and no heater. That plane generally flew at 3,000 feet. I had to circle round and round, gaining a little altitude each time, until I finally got even with the peak. I cleared the top so close I could see bugs on the ground! Then I immediately had to look for a landing field because I needed gas. That trip took a week.''         But she did not think of herself as particularly courageous. Still feisty at 81, Mrs. Kornblum said: ''We all loved to fly, and we were doing our bit for the war. That's all.''         She recalled another flying incident, saying: ''Another time, we were in a group, five or six planes, flying west out of Lockhaven, Pa., and we ran into massive head winds. We weren't too high, and when we looked down on the highway we could see cars and even Amish horse and buggies traveling faster than we were. We had no radio contact, but when we saw the group leader descend -- with no airfield in sight, we all followed and landed in a grassy field to wait until the wind subsided. We had to go to a farmhouse to telephone our destination that we'd be late. The group leader told them, 'Not to worry, we're all in one piece.' ''         While Mrs. Kornblum was flying AT6's and Cubs, other WASP's flew B-17 Flying Fortresses, A-20 Havoc attack bombers and P-51 Mustang pursuit planes.         In 1977, through the intercession of Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, the WASP's were recognized for wartime military service and awarded honorable discharges, given medals and veterans' benefits.         Mrs. Kornblum does not fly anymore, but she is still active and, except for a little arthritis, fit.         One of her volunteer activities is doing ''a bit of everything'' for the Fort Hill Theater group, but she does not act herself. ''I do not perform,'' she said. ''I get cold feet!''       
         Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers.         O.K., it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930's and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son.         Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor before the 1980's, or ever on stage.         Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight sensations.         For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920's.         Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana.         Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her.         It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire.         Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ''until a millionaire comes along, as he put it.''         A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at her skill, she began to get the notion that she might actually become a professional.         She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.         Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and, well, she was such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.         During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she persuaded Mr. Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on. ''The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ''and I didn't like doing it with a partner.''         The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.         It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu recording of ''El Manisero'' (''The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930's.         After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Mr. Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.         It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother tagging along). ''He got it,'' she said. ''He was very good.''         When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, as she recalled, ''Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.''         For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting ''Vive La France.''         Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day,  she was hailed by critics as ''the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ''Mariana scarfs,'' copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.         After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ''that lovely Havana torso flipper.'' Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba was over.         After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway).         When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as a typist.         Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.       
         Kathleen Lukens, a more or less ordinary woman whose life had such an ordinary focus on her children it is a wonder how much people made of what she saw as routine maternal devotion, died on Tuesday at her home in Tappan, N.Y. She was 67 and had been executive director of Camp Venture, a Rockland County service organization for the developmentally disabled that she founded in 1969.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A 1952 Barnard College graduate who taught a year at a private girls' school and worked another year as a police reporter and feature writer for The Bergen Evening Record before marrying and settling into a suburban routine, Mrs. Lukens, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in northern New Jersey, was typical of a generation of women who put their families before careers.         As a standard P.T.A. mom cum after-school chauffeur with the usual array of committee meetings and volunteer work, Mrs. Lukens, a labor organizer's daughter who was also active in the antinuclear and civil rights movements, did pretty much what any suburban mother of her era did. And if her refrigerator to-do list was a bit longer than most, she did, after all, have five children with varying needs to take care of.         As the children came along, Mrs. Lukens simply dealt with their needs as a matter of routine, feeding them, keeping them clean, nursing them through childhood illnesses and sending them off to school and camp.         It was a routine that varied only in the details. When her fourth son, David, turned out to be autistic, for example, and she discovered there were no camps in Rockland County for children with such developmental disabilities, Mrs. Lukens, who had previously helped start a nursery school for her three older sons, did the obvious thing: She started a camp for David.         She called it Camp Venture, and if at first it was more venture than camp, when it comes to taking care of children, one thing tends to lead to another, and almost before Mrs. Lukens knew it, David had grown up and she had built Camp Venture into a sprawling multiservice organization with an $18 million, largely Medicaid-financed, annual budget that now operates 15 supervised group homes, 4 day service centers and  other programs that serve about 1,000 Rockland County adults and children with an array of developmental disorders, including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.         To be sure, Mrs. Lukens, who told David's story in a 1989 novella, ''Song of David,'' had some help, including loving assistance from her husband, Dr. John H. Lukens, a clinical psychologist, from David's four siblings, including his little sister, and from other parents, some of whom moved to Rockland County so they could join Mrs. Lukens's enterprise and their children could benefit from Camp Venture.         Not that it was easy. At a time when the mentally retarded and those with other developmental disabilities were routinely warehoused in indifferent state institutions like the notorious Letchworth Village, to win the required government financing for supervised group homes, Mrs. Lukens had to become a public advocate, buttonholing politicians and organizing campaigns for reform.         Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller was so impressed with her eloquent appeals that he asked her to become a speechwriter. In their turns, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared her New York State 1984 woman of the year and named her to his advisory council on mental retardation and developmental disabilities and Gov. George E. Pataki named her to the state Provider Council in 1996.         By then, Mrs. Lukens had received so many honors and heard so much  praise it was a wonder she had any time for her nine grandchildren.         Not surprisingly, perhaps, four of Mrs. Lukens's children grew up to go into some form of social work: her oldest son, Mark, is a minister in East Rockaway, N.Y.; Jonathan of Carmel, N.Y., and her daughter, Margaret Byrne, of Orangeburg, N.Y., are clinical social workers and Daniel, of Congers, N.Y., is his mother's successor as executive director of Camp Venture.         David, now 36, has what his family describes as a happy life, living at a Camp Venture group home in New City, N.Y., and participating in activities at a Camp Venture day services center, all thanks to the efforts of a more or less ordinary woman who saw her duty as making sure her children got the care they needed.       
         Gina Blau, an American dancer who was an early exponent of Indian classical dance in the United States, died on Oct. 23 at Forest View Nursing Home in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 92.         Ms. Blau was the first non-Indian to be given the title of Natyakala Bushanam (Jewel of the Dance) by the Indian Institute of Fine Arts in Madras.         Before turning to Indian dance in the 1930's, Ms. Blau was one of two women in the 1929 graduating class  of St. John's Law School in New York City. A student of the American modern dancers Pearl Primus, Jean Erdman and Eleanor King, she gave up her legal practice to study Indian dance with Phupesh Guha from 1937 to 1941.         From 1941 to 1945, she choreographed and performed with the company of La Meri, the celebrated American ethnic-dance specialist.         She performed in New York in the troupe of Ragani Devi from 1946 to 1948.         Ms. Blau studied the Bharatya Natyam style in Madras with Guru Chockalingam Pillai in 1954 and became an authority on the highly theatrical Kathakali style after studying with Guru Ravunni Nair in Malabar.         She toured the United States professionally afterward under the name of Shrimathi Gina, sometimes under the auspices of the novelist Pearl Buck.         Ms. Blau taught Indian classical dance for many years in New York and also at colleges throughout the country.         She also taught at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and the Eugene O'Neill National Theater for the Deaf.         Ms. Blau, who was married to the late Lazar Platt, is survived by two sisters, Jeannette Silverman of New York and Gladys Saltzman of Tampa, Fla.       
         Vassar Miller, whose lifelong struggle with cerebral palsy made the simplest tasks arduous yet who wrote 10 volumes of searing and highly regarded poetry, died on Oct. 31 at Houston Methodist Hospital. She was 74.         Ms. Miller's work often explored religious themes, although she also wrote about her own pain and sense of isolation, and there were occasional flashes of acid humor. Poems collected in ''Wage War on Silence'' made her a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. She also was twice named the poet laureate of Texas.         Many Texas writers and critics, most notably Larry McMurtry, lamented the lack of attention paid to her work, which had never been considered particularly fashionable until late in her career. ''That she is to this day little known, read or praised in Texas is the most damning comment possible on our literary culture,'' he wrote in a 1981 essay in The Texas Observer.         Shortly afterward, the Texas Legislature named Ms. Miller the state's poet laureate in 1982, and again in 1988. Last year she was named to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame by the Governor's Commission for Women.         ''If I Had Wheels or Love: Collected Poems of Vassar Miller,'' was published in 1990, drawing on her previous 10 volumes, including her first book of poems, ''Adam's Footprint,'' published in 1956, ''Onions and Roses'' (1968), ''If I Could Sleep Deeply Enough'' (1974) and ''Struggling to Swim on Concrete'' (1984).         The poem ''Change'' from the ''Onions and Roses'' collection is a favorite of her admirers:         I can remember the sun as a great golden eagle spreading its wings to my will.         Now it moves slowly, a buzzard drifting across the sky, over the carrion earth,         or swoops, a hawk, to seize the heart of a newborn puppy dropped from his pain-crazy mother.         Now I give thanks if its claws, absent-minded, release me into some weed patch of sleep.         ''Vassar Miller's poetry is direct, clear and tautly composed, with depths that are immediately accessible,'' a Houston Chronicle reviewer wrote in 1991. ''Her subjects are the same ones that keep most people searching beyond and beneath the surfaces of their daily lives; love, life, emotions and the unfilled longings of the disabled.''         Ms. Miller was born in Houston's museum district. She lived in the same house for most of her life, until increasing infirmity and poverty caused guardians to move her into a nearby nursing home.         She was born with cerebral palsy and always had great difficulty walking and talking. (Late in life she also lost the use of her hands, and she told an interviewer that her dream was to obtain a voice-activated computer so she could continue writing.)         Her stepmother encouraged her to learn to read and write, and urged her to attend public school, and her father led her to creative writing by teaching her to type. Ms. Miller eventually received degrees from the University of Houston and taught creative writing at the University of St. Thomas, near her home.         She was a familiar figure on the streets of the museum district, going from home to church to classes in her motorized cart. ''Sometimes it would tip over and she would laugh,'' Helen Havens, a rector at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, which Ms. Miller attended for many years, told The Houston Chronicle in 1995. ''She had this raucous laughter. When she'd fall down walking, she'd say, 'Don't help me. I can do it myself.' ''         Ms. Miller is survived by two sisters, Joy Morton and Margaret Schomer, both of Houston.         In 1995, when her trust fund had been depleted, friends in Houston held three fund-raisers for her. But guardians said that she required full-time care and there was insufficient money to care for her at home, so she stayed at a nursing home.         She told an interviewer around that time that she felt her poetry would be best remembered for its metaphors, and she listed Bach oratorios and chocolate ice cream among her joys in life.         Asked to describe the meaning of her life, Ms. Miller said: ''To write. And to serve God.''       
         Virginia L. Radley, who as the first female president of a state university college in New York created a general education division and an honors program on the Oswego campus, died on Sunday at her home in Poestenkill, near Albany. She was 71.         She suffered a brief illness, the DeGraaf-Bryce Funeral Home reported.         Dr. Radley, an expert in 19th-century poetry, taught throughout her years as an administrator. She was  dean at Russell Sage College and Nazareth College of Rochester before moving to Oswego as executive vice president, provost and professor of English in 1974. She was named acting president of the State University College at Oswego two years later.         She accepted a permanent appointment in 1978 and was the president for 10 years. During her tenure, she promoted enrollment of members of racial minorities and oversaw a marked increase in the number of women on the college faculty and staff. She taught at Oswego until 1992, when she returned to Russell Sage College in Troy to teach as a resident scholar.         She was born in Marion, N.Y.,  graduated from Russell Sage College and received an M.A. at the University of Rochester and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at Syracuse University. She was the author of two books on romantic and Victorian writers and of many articles and reviews.         Dr. Radley is survived by a brother, Erwin Radley of Poestenkill.       
         Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the daughter of Gerald and Sara Murphy, the golden couple at the center of the modernist whirl in 1920's Europe, who was dandled on the knees of the towering figures of the avant-garde, died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Palm Beach in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach Shores and East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was liver cancer, said Amanda Vaill, the author of ''Everybody Was So Young: Gerald and Sara Murphy -- A Lost Generation Love Story'' (Houghton Mifflin).         Mrs. Donnelly, the eldest of the Murphys' three children and the only one to reach adulthood, published a biography of her parents, ''Sara & Gerald: Villa America and After'' (Times Books) written with Richard N. Billings, in 1982.         Attractive, cultured and well-to-do (Gerald was heir to the Mark Cross leather goods fortune, Sara the daughter of an industrialist and a grandniece of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman), the Murphys epitomized the urbane insouciance of the jazz age. Although Gerald enjoyed a brief career as a painter -- his small output remains well regarded -- he and his wife were content to occupy backstage roles as bartenders, muses and sometime financial angels to the foremost writers, composers and artists of their age.         In return, the Murphys were memorialized (not always graciously) in the work they supported. They were the inspiration for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ''Tender is the Night''; Sara was the model for Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' and Fitzgerald bestowed the name Honoria on the heroine of his 1931 story ''Babylon Revisited.''         Honoria Adeline Murphy (she pronounced the 'H' in her first name) was born in New York on Dec. 19, 1917. Fair haired and blue eyed, she ''looked like a Renoir and was dressed accordingly,'' in the words of the Murphy biographer Calvin Tomkins.         In 1921, partly to escape the philistinism of American culture, the Murphys sailed for Europe with Honoria and her younger brothers, Baoth and Patrick. In Paris they painted scenery for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which gave them entree to a circle that included Picasso and Jean Cocteau.         In the summer of 1925 the family moved to Antibes, on the Riviera, then an unheard-of destination in warm weather. (The Murphys are credited with starting the Riviera's summer season.) They christened their house Villa America.         At Villa America, they moved in a shimmering bubble that seemed to insulate them from ordinary cares. The late 20's passed there in a charmed blur of jazz and Champagne and beaded dresses, of spats and white flannels and sherry and biscuits on the seashore. A representative guest list: Picasso, Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Archibald MacLeish, Philip Barry, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Cole Porter, Monty Woolley, Igor Stravinsky, Fernand Leger and Ernest and consecutive Mrs. Hemingways.         To Honoria and her brothers, these artistic titans were simply the adored tall people of their enchanted childhood. Hemingway taught her to catch and gut fish. (She got off easy: he once tried to teach her father to bullfight.) The photographs in the family album were by Man Ray. Scrutinizing one of Honoria's drawings hung on the Villa America terrace (nicknamed ''Les Salons de Jeunesse''), Picasso counseled, ''Don't change it.''         As a young woman, she studied French theater history with Mrs. Darius Milhaud and acting with Mrs. Patrick Campbell. She later performed with the French Theater of New York and worked as a secretary for Theater Inc., a producing organization. In recent years, she lectured on the Lost Generation writers and opened her vast archive of family memorabilia to scholars of the period.         In 1929 the real world intruded savagely on the Murphys' idyll when their youngest son, Patrick, was found to have tuberculosis. They returned to the United States, where Honoria attended Rosemary Hall School in Greenwich, Conn., and the Spence School in New York, from which she graduated in 1937.         It was Baoth who died first, in 1935, after contracting spinal meningitis at 15. ''Only the invented part of our life -- the unreal part -- has had any scheme, any beauty,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Fitzgerald. ''Life itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed.''         Two years later Patrick died at 16. Fitzgerald wrote to the Murphys: ''For a long, long time you will be inconsolable. But I can see another generation growing up around Honoria and an eventual peace somewhere.''         A devoted daughter who was ever conscious of her responsibility as the sole surviving child, Honoria fulfilled that prophecy. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she wed William M. Donnelly, a businessman, in 1950. (On their honeymoon, she telephoned her parents every night.) The couple lived in Carmel, Calif., and later in McLean, Va. Mrs. Donnelly, who was widowed in 1988, is survived by their children, John, of Palm Beach Shores; Sherman, of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Laura, of East Hampton, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         ''How different a dawn than the one we saw in a hospital 18 years ago,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Sara after the Donnellys' second son was born. ''Two boys went out from our family, and now two other boys have come into it.''       
         Viola Farber, a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a choreographer and the director of the dance program at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Dec. 24 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 67 and lived in Bronxville.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, Jeff Slayton, her former husband and longtime dance partner, said.         A tall, long-bodied individualist with uncompromisingly cropped hair long before that was fashionable, Ms. Farber was an unself-conscious study in quiet unpredictability. She moved with a fierce passion and intensity and a gentle lyricism. She could speak with the softness of a shy, reflective child or, in the studio, with the toughness of a drill sergeant. An edge of lazily subversive wit lay beneath her plain-spokenness in conversation and in her dancing.         In the quintessentially Farberesque ''Legacy,'' which she choreographed in 1968 to a Chopin etude, Ms. Farber moved like a dreaming, elegant giraffe, dressed in a flowing shift but wearing a baseball catcher's mitt on one hand. Poetic and mysterious, the solo was not at all Dadaist despite the incongruity and potential humor of the mitt.         ''Her body often had the look of one part being in balance, and the rest extremely off,'' Mr. Cunningham wrote of her in David Vaughan's book ''Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,'' in a description of Ms. Farber in his 1960 ''Crises,'' created in part for her odd talents. ''Now and again it was like two persons, another just ahead or behind the first. This was coupled with an acute rhythmic sense.''         Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Ms. Farber came to the United States with her family at the age of 7 and became a naturalized citizen six years later. She met Mr. Cunningham and his collaborator John Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College, where she was studying dance with Katherine Litz and music with Lou Harrison. Ms. Farber joined the Cunningham company in 1953, dancing there through 1965. She created roles in some of Mr. Cunningham's major early works, among them ''Crises,'' ''Rune'' and ''Nocturne.''         During her Cunningham years, she also performed with Litz, playing a vampire in her ''Dracula,'' and with Peter Saul and Paul Taylor. Her last performance was in a 1995 collaborative duet, ''Threestep (Shipwreck),'' which she created with the choreographer Ralph Lemon, a former student, for his company's season at the Joyce Theater.         Ms. Farber formed the Viola Farber Dance Company in 1968, creating most of her choreography for the troupe, which disbanded in 1985. Writing in the International Encyclopedia of Dance, Christopher Caines describes her earliest dances as having a febrile atmosphere and ''a dark, violent intensity that some interpreted as sadomasochistic, despite moments of tenderness.'' By the 1970's, Ms. Farber had mellowed considerably. ''My dances report what I see,'' she told Jack Anderson in a 1978 interview in The New York Times. ''They are my response to the way everything is mixed up together in this world -- people and microbes and elephants and cassowary birds.''         In her 1973 ''Poor Eddie,'' Ms. Farber incorporated the gestures of flight attendants as they demonstrate the use of safety equipment in planes. Her own nervousness about driving in the middle, passing lane on a three-lane highway inspired the creation of another dance, ''Route 6.'' Like Mr. Cunningham, Ms. Farber favored the juxtaposition of disparate kinds of activity in dance, where formal patterns and the combinations of steps often mattered more than the steps themselves.         Ms. Farber was especially popular in France, where she won a gold medal, with Mr. Slayton, in the Ninth International Dance Festival in Paris in 1971. From 1981 to 1983 she was the artistic director of the Centre National de Danse Contemporaine in Angers, establishing, at the same time, an institute for the training of dance teachers in Paris. Ms. Farber returned to the United States in 1988 to take the Sarah Lawrence post, but continued to teach and choreograph in France into the 1990's. She also taught at the London Contemporary Dance School from 1984 to 1987 and, from early in her career, at universities and dance festivals throughout the United States.         The French Government recently named Ms. Farber an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France.         She is survived by two sisters, Elisabeth Lanzl of Chicago and Irene Aikin of Parkdale, Ore.         Correction:  January 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the dancer and choreographer Viola Farber on Dec. 31 misstated the work and the year in which she last performed. It was in James Cunningham's ''From the Horse's Mouth'' at the Joyce SoHo last April, not in ''Threestep (Shipwreck)'' in 1995.       
         Dr. Theodora Mead Abel, a psychologist who brought an anthropologist's view to her study of the Indians of New Mexico, died Dec. 2 at her home in Forestburgh, N.Y. She was 99.         Dr. Abel was a leader in cross-cultural psychological research, which became her main focus after retiring from a career largely in family therapy in New York, said Dr. Samuel Roll, a professor of psychology at the University of New Mexico. Dr. Roll collaborated with Dr. Abel in studies of Mexicans and Indians, including the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apaches, the Navajo, and the people of the Laguna, Taos, Santo Domingo and other pueblos in northern New Mexico.         In Albuquerque, Indians of several tribes gave her the title ''grandmother'' as an indication of the respect they held for her.         The key to her success in therapy with Indian patients was her understanding of the importance placed on a balance of life's forces, and she often asked family members to join in the therapy, Dr. Roll said.         At age 98, Dr. Abel received the American Psychological Foundation's 1997 Gold Medal Award for life achievement.         Theodora Abel was born in Newport, R.I., and received her B.A. from Vassar College in 1921, her M.A. from Columbia University in 1924 and her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1925.         While a graduate student, she met and became friends with Margaret Mead while they were lined up alphabetically to take care of paperwork. Though they shared the same last name at the time, they were not related. Decades later, Dr. Mead, by then known worldwide for her work in anthropology, wrote the introduction for Dr. Abel's book ''Culture and Psychotherapy'' (College and University Press, 1975), written with Rhoda Metraux.         Dr. Abel taught at the University of Illinois and at Sarah Lawrence College and later became the director of research at the Manhattan Trade School for Girls. In 1940, she joined Letchworth Village psychiatric center in Rockland County, N.Y.,  as a research psychologist. In 1947, she joined the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Manhattan, where she was director of psychoanalysis.         In 1971, she moved to New Mexico and began her work there. When she was 88, she collaborated on a new version of her 1975 book, this time called ''Psychotherapy and Culture'' (University of New Mexico Press, 1987), with Dr. Roll and Ms. Metraux. Also in 1971, she became a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, and at the university's Child Guidance Center she became chief of family therapy service. She saw patients into her 90's.         Her husband, Theodore Abel, died in 1988. Dr. Abel returned to New York this year.         Survivors include two daughters, Caroline Lalire of Hamilton, Va., and Zita Emerson of Albuquerque; a son, Peter Abel of St. Davids, Pa., 10 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.
