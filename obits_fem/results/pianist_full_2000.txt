         Hedy Lamarr, the raven-haired Viennese beauty who became one of the reigning temptresses in Hollywood films in the 1930's and 40's, especially as Delilah vamping Victor Mature's Samson, was found dead in her home in Orlando, Fla., yesterday. She was 86.         Miss Lamarr was forever identified with ''Ecstasy,'' a 1933 Czech film in which she appeared nude in a swimming scene and in a lovemaking sequence that was torrid for its time. The film was banned in many places in the United States for a number of years. But even though most Americans never saw it, ''Ecstasy'' excited their interest in the actress and shaped her career.         But as David Thomson, the film historian, said of her work in the United States: ''It became her lot to be cast as exotic, sultry women -- and she did her best; but conscientiousness is not quite what we expect in our femme fatales. Too often, she had a worried look.''         Miss Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler in Vienna, the daughter of a well-to-do banker and a concert pianist. She studied acting with Max Reinhardt in Vienna in 1931. He watched her read her lines one day and declared that she was either ''the most beautiful girl in the world'' or ''the most beautiful girl in Europe.'' (Press reports at the time carried both versions.)         She appeared in a few films before ''Ecstasy,'' a mostly silent film that was well received in Europe, where it was released as ''Symphonie der Liebe.'' Pope Pius XI  denounced it, but Mussolini issued a permit so that it could be shown at the Venice Film Festival. It won no awards there but attracted attentive audiences, most of them men.         By the time ''Ecstasy'' had begun to make the rounds in Europe, Miss Kiesler  was married to the first of her six husbands, Fritz Mandl, a Viennese munitions maker who was then in the process of making a tidy fortune by selling his wares to the Nazis. Mr. Mandl was upset by the film and spent a great sum of money tracking down and purchasing prints of ''Ecstasy'' so that nobody would see it. He explained that it was not so much because his wife could be seen nude, but because of the look on her face during the sex scenes.         Mr. Mandl came to regret all the money he spent buying the film. He didn't get all the prints. Then the Nazis seized his factory (he didn't pay his taxes, they claimed), and  Miss Kiesler left him (she thought he was dull) and made her way to London. There she got an acting job and was seen by Louis B. Mayer, who immediately offered her a contract to work for MGM, his Hollywood studio. Mr. Mayer changed her name to Lamarr after a silent film star named Barbara La Marr, whom he admired.         ''Ecstasy'' arrived in the United States in 1934 and was promptly banned in New York.  It was the subject of numerous court tests in the 1930's.         When the star of ''Ecstasy'' arrived in New York on the liner Normandie in 1937, she was mindful that ''Ecstasy'' had arrived before her and was determined to have audiences believe she was more than just a pretty face. She refused to display her knees for the photographers from the New York dailies who met the ship (her skirt reached her ankles), and she asked them not to refer to her as Hedy Kiesler anymore. ''Please call me Hedy Lamarr,'' she said.         In 1938 she made her first American film, ''Algiers,'' with Charles Boyer, with the result that undergraduates at Columbia voted her the girl with whom they would most like to be marooned on a desert island. She became popular; men fantasized about her, and women began to wear their hair as she did, parted down the middle.         But Miss Lamarr never achieved the stardom of some of her fellow emigrees -- Greta Garbo, Greer Garson or Marlene Dietrich -- all of whom won plaudits not just for their  sex appeal but also for their acting. The reviews of Miss Lamarr's films all emphasized her beauty, but when the scripts actually gave her something to say, the critics were not as passionate.         ''Now that she has inadvisedly been given an opportunity to act,'' wrote Bosley Crowther, reviewing ''Lady of the Tropics'' for The New York Times in 1939, ''it is necessary to report that she is essentially one of those museum pieces, like the Mona Lisa, who were more beautiful in repose.''         When she played a seductress enchanting  British plantation owners in Africa in ''White Cargo'' in 1942, Miss Lamarr purred, ''I am Tondelayo.'' This became grist for comedians; Jack Benny made  many jokes on the radio about an imaginary salesgirl named Tondelayo Schwartzkopf.         In another of her best-known roles, she gave Victor Mature the ultimate haircut in  ''Samson and Delilah,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 epic. DeMille, who never overlooked the box-office potential of sexy women in the Bible and the actresses who played them, had a clinging gown made for her out of feathers from prize peacocks he kept.         Among Miss Lamarr's other films were  ''Comrade X'' (1940) with Clark Gable, for King Vidor; ''Boom Town'' (also 1940), in which she seduced Gable. She also appeared as a showgirl with Judy Garland and Lana Turner in ''Ziegfeld Girl'' (1941), and with Spencer Tracy and John Garfield in ''Tortilla Flat'' (1942). She was considered difficult to please and was said to have turned down memorable parts that went to Gene Tierney (''Laura'') and Ingrid Bergman (''Casablanca'' and ''Gaslight.'') After her appearance in ''Samson and Delilah'' she went on to display her perfect profile in such films as ''Copper Canyon'' (1950), ''A Lady Without Passport'' (1950), the comedy ''My Favorite Spy'' (1951) and ''The Story of Mankind'' (1957) as her career faded .         Her private life was messy and sad.         In early 1939, she met Gene Markey, a writer and producer in Hollywood, and they  eloped to Mexico. She divorced Mr. Markey the following year, complaining to a judge that they had been married for 14 months and that in all that time, he had spent only four evenings alone with her. The judge granted the divorce, but suggested that if she ever contemplated a future marriage, she should spend more than a month getting to know her man.         After her divorce from Mr. Markey, Miss Lamarr went to a Hollywood dinner party at the home of Janet Gaynor and there met George Antheil, the composer. Miss Lamarr and Antheil got to talking about the war and how tough it was going to be to stop the Nazis.         As the story goes, Miss Lamarr recalled hearing some conversations that had occurred between her first husband, Mr. Mandl, and the Nazis, who seemed to place great value on creating some sort of device that would permit the radio control of airborne torpedoes and reduce the danger of jamming. She and Antheil got to discussing all this. The idea, they decided, was to defeat jamming efforts by sending synchronized radio signals on various wavelengths to missiles, which could then be directed to hit their mark.         Antheil supplied the technical expertise for the concept and on Aug. 11, 1942, the two received a United States patent for the use of radio-controlled missiles that could be used against the Germans. There were some doubts that Miss Lamarr had the technical background to give much to the project, but Antheil always credited her. The government was not initially interested in their device, but a refined version of it was used by the American military in the 1960's -- after the patent had expired. They never made a dime. In 1996 they were honored for their work by a professional engineering society. ''It's about time,'' was Miss Lamarr's only comment.         In 1941 Miss Lamarr was briefly engaged to the actor George Montgomery. She continued to make movies and worked hard to sell millions of dollars in war bonds. She told an audience in Philadelphia that she was just ''a gold digger for Uncle Sam.'' In the spring of 1943 she married the British actor John Loder. She knew him six months before she married him. They were divorced three years later.         Miss Lamarr's other marriages -- to Teddy Stauffer, a former band leader who ran a nightclub in Acapulco, Mexico; Howard Lee, a Texas oilman; and Lewis W. Boles, a West Coast lawyer -- all ended in divorce.         She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Denise; they all survive her.         Early in her career, a certain litigiousness manifested itself and continued to dog her existence. In 1943 she sued Loew's and MGM because they failed to pay her a contractual $2,000 a week. They said they were unable to pay her what they owed because President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had issued a wartime executive order limiting all salaries to $25,000 a year. The case was settled out of court.         Over the years, she was involved in several other lawsuits that did not work out so well. Among them was one against a Los Angeles department store that had accused her of shoplifting. (She was acquitted of the charge, and her own lawsuit against the store was dismissed.)         Best known of her lawsuits was one directed in the 1960's and 70's against the publisher and ghostwriter of ''Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman,'' an autobiography that was intended to revive her notoriety as a sex goddess. She said the book was ''deliberately written as an obscene, shocking, scandalous, naughty, wanton, fleshy, sensual, lecherous, lustful and scarlet version'' of her life. Her suit failed.         In 1991, living sparingly in South Florida, she was again accused of shoplifting ($21 worth of personal-care items from a drug store) but not prosecuted. In recent years, Miss Lamarr lived quietly in a suburb of Orlando. Friends said she was legally blind and did not venture out on her own.         ''What happened to me?,'' Miss Lamarr  asked the syndicated columnist Sheilah  Graham in 1966. ''I made $7 million and yet I was on relief and they gave me all of $48 a week.''         ''I'm not so crazy about acting,'' she told Miss Graham. ''All that makeup and getting up so early. Maybe I'll go to Europe. Oh, they want me. I have many offers.''       
         Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral, chamber and vocal music, died on Monday at the Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was 86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years. Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980's her shorter works were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.         Ms. Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.         In the mid-1930's Ms. Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ''The Race of Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ''Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles Weidman and ''Tragic Exodus'' and ''They Too Are Exiles'' (both 1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ''Alcestis'' (1960) for Graham and ''My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.         Ms. Fine's symphonic works include ''Elegiac Song'' for muted strings (1937) and ''Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano, baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).         As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from 1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of her operas, ''The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings. Her last major work, ''The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and Ruth Crawford Seeger.         Still, Ms. Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by their sex. ''I hope the term 'woman composer' will be dropped soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989. ''I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk of 'poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists -- singers, pianists, violinists -- have been accepted for a long time.''         Ms. Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and Bennington College in Vermont.         She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of North Bennington, Vt.         Correction:  March 28, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the composer Vivian Fine on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her husband, Benjamin Karp of Hoosick Falls, N.Y.       
         Vivian Harris, a comedian and chorus girl and the performer with the most recorded appearances -- 10,000 -- at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, died Feb. 18 in Englewood, N.J. She was 97.         Ms. Harris, who died at the Nursing and Retirement Home of the Actors Fund of America, was one of the women hired by the manager of the Cotton Club for a new chorus line when Duke Ellington came to play for the white audience there. She was one of the first ever to dance the Charleston, in the 1923 Broadway  show ''Runnin' Wild.''         She performed with the top black comics Pigmeat Markham, Spider Bruce and Ralph Cooper during the  Depression years, when comedy kept the Apollo afloat.         Leonard Reed, a singer and dancer at the Apollo in 1935 and theater manager from 1950 to 1960, remembers her as ''one of the sweetest girls I ever met in my life.'' Indeed, the two were sweethearts from 1927 until 1929. Until the Apollo started using masters of ceremony in the mid-1950's, he said, it was her voice, clear and precise, that came from behind the curtain to announce the night's big attraction.         ''She would say, 'The Apollo Theater takes great pleasure in presenting Duke Ellington' or Cab Calloway, or whoever,'' he said.         William Miles, a filmmaker who made the 1981 documentary ''I Remember Harlem,'' said Ms. Harris was known as the Voice of the Apollo. In addition to her announcements, he said, she often sang ''I May Be Wrong, but I Think You're Wonderful.''         Ms. Harris was born on Dec. 23, 1902, in Harlem. She was the second of five daughters; the others were Lottie, Margie, Lorraine and Edna Mae, who became a star of the black cinema. Her father, Sam, gained some fame as a boxer and then became a customs inspector. Her mother, Mary, worked as a maid for the Gay 90's pin-up Lillian Russell, among others.         As blacks gradually moved uptown, the Harrises were among the first black families to migrate to Harlem. They wanted to be near the new home of their church. Their brownstone on 132nd Street was also near the Lafayette Theater, where stars like Ethel Waters, Maud Russell and Butterbeans and Susie would perform.         Her sister Lottie was something of a groupie; she would invite the performers to the house for dinner and often to stay for the night. Mr. Harris said, ''I might as well open a rooming house,'' and did.         This resulted in the stars' practicing routines in the house's big kitchen. They worked with the girls on their singing and dancing skills and  encouraged them to pursue show business careers. All but Margie did.         After graduating from Julia Richmond High School, Vivian joined ''Shuffle Along,'' the Broadway production put together in 1921 by the ragtime pianist Eubie Blake and the singer and lyricist Noble Sissle. The show ushered in a series of successful black musicals on Broadway.         Ms. Harris went on to be a chorus girl in ''Runnin' Wild,'' with music by James P. Johnson and lyrics by Cecil Mack, which added a new dance, the Charleston, to the national repertory. Mae Barnes introduced the dance in the first act, but Ms. Harris's spirited third-act version also drew enthusiastic attention.         A review in The New York Times of Oct. 31, 1923, said that in addition to its funny comedy, the show ''excels in eccentric dancing -- some of the most exciting steps of the season (though steps is not always the right word, for knees are used more often than ankles) are now on view at the Colonial.''         Ms. Harris performed in other productions on what came to be known as Black Broadway. She traveled to Paris, London and other European cities with Lew Leslie's ''Blackbirds,'' a theatrical revue. Working with Tim Moore, who became famous as Kingfish in the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' television series, she performed the burial scene from the play ''Porgy,'' the precursor to the same scene in Gershwin's opera ''Porgy and Bess.''         When Duke Ellington started at the Cotton Club in 1927, the manager hired a new chorus line, which included Ms. Harris. ''They had nothing but light girls, they didn't have any real dark girls there at the time,'' Ms. Harris said in the Harlem documentary. ''Only the two girls at the ends of the line were dark.'' She was considered light.         The women wore big, feathery costumes, and Ms. Harris's exotic tap dance caught the eye of one of Ellington's trumpet players, Louis Metcalf. The two were married, with cases of  Champagne to celebrate, despite Prohibition. Ms. Harris said the gangsters who controlled the Cotton Club were the benefactors.         In 1935 Frank Schiffman, the manager of the Lafayette Theater, bought a burlesque house on 125th Street that Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia had ordered closed. It became the Apollo.         Ms. Harris started there in 1935 as the voice behind the curtain, and over the years performed with almost all the popular black comedy acts. She played in the first rendition of Pigmeat Markham's ''Here comes  the judge'' skit, immortalized for a later generation by Flip Wilson.         In Dusty Fletcher's ''Open the door, Richard'' skit, another classic of the black comedic stage, she played the woman in the window  Dusty vainly tried to reach.         When Mr. Moore went out to California to play Kingfish on ''Amos 'n' Andy,'' he recommended Ms. Harris to play Kingfish's wife, Sapphire. She flunked the screen test.         ''I came out looking too white,'' Ms. Harris said. ''I was rejected and it broke my heart.''         But she stayed at the Apollo until 1970, working as cashier and in the wardrobe department when she was not onstage. Undoubtedly, some of her 10,000 appearances involved exchanging tickets for money in the box office.         Her sister Edna Mae, who left home to star in films, including ''The Green Pastures'' in 1936 and ''The Notorious Elinor Lee'' in 1940, always lamented that her sister did not aim higher.         ''She could have had a career like Ethel Waters or Alberta Hunter,'' Edna Mae said in the 1980's. ''I still don't know why she stayed.''         Vivian's marriage was brief, and she never remarried. There are no immediate survivors. But when she visited Harlem, as she did almost every day until recent years, everybody greeted her.         Mr. Reed, Ms. Harris's long-ago boyfriend, was known for his theme song, ''It's Over Because We're Through.'' But he says he cannot  remember why he and Ms. Harris broke up.         ''There wasn't a hate bone in Vivian's body,'' he said.       
         Evelyn Swarthout Hayes, a former concert pianist, educator and arts patron, died on March 24 at George Washington University Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Hayes, who was born Evelyn Swarthout in Jacksonville, Ill., began her music career in the 1930's, appearing several times in recitals at Town Hall in New York. In 1939 she married Patrick Hayes, a music administrator. The couple moved to Washington when he was appointed manager of the National Symphony Orchestra.         Mrs. Hayes joined the piano faculty at American University in 1951 and taught there until retiring in 1976. She also continued to perform, giving recitals at the National Gallery and elsewhere, and she created ''Music in Schools,'' an educational radio program for young listeners.         She served as a judge in many piano competitions as well as giving lectures and master classes around the country.         Her husband, who founded the Hayes Concert Bureau -- later renamed the Washington Performing Arts Society -- died in 1998. She is survived by a son, Bryant, of New York; a daughter, Elisabeth Hayes of Chicago; a grandchild; two step-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren.       
         Teri Thornton, a jazz singer who had started to resurrect her career after winning the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 1998 and being signed to a major record label for the first time in three decades, died on Tuesday at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey. She was 65 and lived at the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood.         The cause was cancer of the bladder, said her manager, Suzi Reynolds.         Ms. Thornton had a husky, keening voice with a muscly vibrato; she was a vibrant performer with a caustic sense of humor, and she was particularly gifted at coaxing harmonic complexity and emotion out of the blues.         She was born in Detroit, where her parents, Robert Avery, a Pullman porter, and Burniece Crews Avery, a choir director and singer who was the host of a local radio show, encouraged her to study classical music.         Ms. Thornton, whose original name was Shirley Enid Avery, took up jazz instead, learning to sing and play the piano. By the age of 19, she was a divorced mother of two and had not yet begun to sing professionally.         But she found a spot at the Ebony Club in Cleveland and within a few years was living in Chicago and appearing with the saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Cannonball Adderley and finding work as the intermission pianist for strippers at the Red Garter nightclub.         Her career took off in 1961, with the release of her album ''Devil May Care,'' in which she sang in the company of the pianist Wynton Kelly and the Count Basie sidemen Clark Terry and Freddie Green. Her biggest hit, ''Somewhere in the Night,'' came a year later; it had been the theme of the television series ''Naked City,'' and she found herself singing it on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and other variety programs.         Ms. Thornton was signed by Columbia Records, and her exposure increased. She took part in a television program celebrating Duke Ellington's 40th anniversary in music, and Ella Fitzgerald told Down Beat magazine that Ms. Thornton was her favorite singer.         But at that point, her career started to slide. She attributed her downfall not only to the rise of rock 'n' roll but also to bad management and her addiction to drugs and alcohol. She moved to Los Angeles in the late 1960's and throughout the next decade took what jobs were available, including driving a taxi.         In 1979 she began her career again, playing and singing in piano bars. After moving to New York in the early 1980's she became a regular at small restaurant clubs like Zinno's and Cleopatra's Needle.         She was performing at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland in 1998 when she collapsed and underwent emergency surgery. Cancer was diagnosed and she underwent radiation and chemotherapy treatments, but she decided to compete in the Thelonious Monk competition in Washington.         The strength of her performance was undeniable, Peter Watrous wrote in The New York Times. She won the $20,000 prize ''by singing well and digging into some of the best aspects of black entertainment culture, the parts that make audience members and performers join in the same experience.''         Verve Records signed her, and she made an album called ''I'll Be Easy to Find.'' In January she filled a weeklong engagement at the Village Vanguard in Manhattan.         Ms. Thornton is survived by two sons, Kenneth Thornton of Detroit and Kelly Glusovich of New York; a daughter, Rose McKinney-James of Las Vegas; and six grandchildren.       
         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Teresa Sterne, a pioneering producer of classical recordings, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Norma Hurlburt, executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.         As the director of Nonesuch Records from 1965 through 1979, Ms. Sterne turned a small budget label into one of the most adventurous companies in the recording business.  When she was invited to take charge of Nonesuch, the label was a subsidiary of the pop-oriented and profitable Elektra Records. Nonesuch's business had consisted mostly of acquiring the rights to existing recordings of Baroque music by European ensembles and reissuing them at budget prices in the United States.         Ms. Sterne, called Tracey by her friends and colleagues, brought a vision to the job born of her long experience in music. She had been a piano prodigy, and though she gave up public performance as an adult, she maintained close ties with the composers and performers of her day.         At Nonesuch she brought attention to areas of music neglected by the major labels, particularly contemporary music and American vernacular music. She championed American composers like George Crumb, Elliott Carter, Morton Subotnick, Charles Wuorinen and Donald Martino, not just recording their works but commissioning them, an unusual move for the leader of a record company. She also issued important recordings of lesser-known works by Schoenberg, Busoni, Stravinsky and other major figures.         She nurtured relationships with several excellent performers not widely known at the time, like the pianist Paul Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert Kalish. Many of the artists she discovered were first recognized  for their work in contemporary music. Ms. Sterne encouraged them to  record past works that interested them as well, like Jacobs's critically hailed recording of the Debussy etudes and Mr. Kalish's engaging survey of the Haydn piano sonatas.         The mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her husband and professional partner, the composer and pianist William Bolcom, made some popular Nonesuch recordings of vernacular American songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And Ms. Sterne sparked a nationwide craze for ragtime with a series of Scott Joplin piano works played by Joshua Rifkin.         She was also in the forefront of the early instrument movement in Baroque and Renaissance repertory. And under her leadership, Nonesuch's Explorer series introduced music from Bali, India, Peru and other countries to a wider audience. Ms. Sterne believed that every record she produced should have a purpose, and she involved herself with everything, from the packaging to the liner notes.         But in late 1979 she was dismissed from Nonesuch. Early in her tenure the record label had been acquired by Warner Communications, and by the mid-1970's, it was grouped under a parent company, Elektra/Asylum/ Nonesuch, headed by Joe Smith. Warner officials asserted that Nonesuch was losing money. In an interview with The Boston Globe at the time, Mr. Smith said: ''Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in its marketplace. We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian Tea Room.''         Ms. Sterne argued that the losses were mostly caused by the parent company's poor marketing and distribution. A letter condemning her dismissal, written by 10 Pulitzer Prize-winning composers, including Mr. Carter and Aaron Copland, was sent to the vice president of Warner Communications and widely circulated in the press, to no avail.         Ms. Sterne never anticipated becoming a record producer. She was born in Brooklyn on March 29, 1927, to a cultured family with a toehold on the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who gave up her career to nurture her musical daughter. Ms. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, a professional violinist, became an important mentor.         From the age of 10, she was educated at home by private tutors, living with her mother and a beloved aunt in ''a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' as she once told a friend. In 1939, when she was 12, she made her professional debut as a pianist playing Grieg's Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra at Madison Square Garden. The next year she played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, winning cheers from the audience and glowing reviews from critics. Her career as a prodigy flourished.         But after such a rarefied and isolated upbringing, Ms. Sterne felt that she lacked the pragmatism and confidence to pursue a professional career. Wanting experience in the real world, she became a secretary, soon winding up in the offices of the powerful manager Sol Hurok, where she nurtured the careers of other young artists. A series of administrative jobs, including assistant to the director at Vanguard Records, led to her  hiring by Nonesuch.         Ms. Sterne, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors. After her dismissal from Nonesuch, the company went through many changes. Earlier this year, Robert Hurwitz, its director since 1984 and a great admirer of Ms. Sterne, issued a two-disc recording in tribute to her, containing highlights from favorite albums she had produced and live recordings of performances she gave in her early years as a piano prodigy.
