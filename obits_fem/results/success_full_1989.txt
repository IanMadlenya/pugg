        Beatrice Lillie, who during a half-century theatrical career was often called ''the funniest woman in the world,'' died yesterday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, England. She was 94 years old.         Beatrice Lillie, who during a half-century theatrical career was often called ''the funniest woman in the world,'' died yesterday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, England. She was 94 years old.         Miss Lillie, who used a long cigarette holder to punctuate the barbed ripostes for which she was famous, was the widow of Sir Robert Peel. But she never took her official title, Lady Peel, seriously and called her autobiography ''Every Other Inch a Lady.''         The Canadian-born comedienne suffered a series of strokes several years ago that silenced her voice and ended her career. Her last Broadway show was ''High Spirits,'' a 1964 musical version of Sir Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit,'' and her last film was the 1966 musical ''Thoroughly Modern Millie.''         The very name Beatrice Lillie could evoke memories of mirth and merriment for the hundreds of thousands of people she entertained in theaters, movie houses, vaudeville palaces and supper clubs and on radio and television, over a period of more than 50 years.         In Alexander Woollcott's estimation, Miss Lillie was ''a comic genius'' with her trademark close-cropped hair and fezlike cap. She was, in fact, one of those rare entertainers whose talents and qualities are extremely difficult to measure and describe. One had to see her to believe her - or perhaps disbelieve her. She was a great clown who learned early how to ''play'' an audience.         Because of that fact, it was often said that no two Lillie performances were ever the same. She explained that for most of her performances, when things went well, ''the wand was on; something happened between myself and the audience, for they recognized something I'd known for years - I was a natural-born fool.'' State of Havoc         Anyone who ever saw her sketch about a slightly tipsy, tongue-tied Mrs. Blagdon Blogg turning Harrods department store in London into a state of havoc, would consider her an adorably nutty fool. In the sketch, Mrs. Blogg tried, unsuccessfully, to buy ''two dozen double-damask dinner napkins,'' a request that soon started coming off her thickened tongue as ''two dazzle dimask dibble dimmer napples,'' and so forth.         In her sketches and songs, most of which were constructed to puncture the pompous, Miss Lillie could send her audiences into fits of laughter by merely lifting an eyebrow, twitching her nose as she spoke a certain phrase or turning her longish face into a rubbery U-shape with a somewhat equine smile. With great ease she seemed able to contort and mold that face into a thousand shapes.         Often it was not precisely what she said or sang that garnered so many laughs, but the way she delivered the material. As the critic George Jean Nathan put it, ''With one dart of her eyes, she can spare a skit writer a dozen lines.''         Sir Noel, Miss Lillie's devoted friend and often the writer of her material, her director or her co-star, finally grew accustomed to her idiosyncrasies. ''For an author-director to attempt to pin Beattie down to a meticulous delineation of character is a direct invitation to nervous collapse,'' he said. Natural Instinct for Humor         Miss Lillie had a natural instinct for humor. One spring day, while she was serving tea to friends in her East End Avenue apartment in New York, a pigeon flew in the window and sat on the arm of a chair. Some of Miss Lillie's guests were startled, but she merely looked at the bird and asked, ''Any messages?''         Beatrice Gladys Lillie was born in Toronto on May 29, 1894. Her father, John Lillie, a native of Northern Ireland, had served with the British Army in India before he married Lucie Shaw, an Englishwoman. Beatrice had an older sister, Muriel.         Mrs. Lillie, who enjoyed a modest reputation as a concert singer, had great expectations for her daughters - Muriel would be a concert pianist, Beatrice a soprano - and their musical training began early.         The Lillie Trio - Mrs. Lillie, Beatrice and Muriel - entertained at local soirees and did a bit of touring, but Beatrice was showing signs of being an undisciplined soprano. The trouble was that she had discovered early the pleasures of making people laugh while she sang. At 8 years of age, she was thrown out of a church choir for making funny gestures and flopping her fan about during serious moments, causing small boys to giggle uncontrollably. Top Hat and Tails         At 15, Miss Lillie ended what had been at best a mere pass at a formal education, and sailed for England, where her mother had taken Muriel to study music. Her first stage appearance, which ran a week, was as a male impersonator, a role she was to play off and on, in top hat and tails, for several years. ''I was the best-dressed transvestite in the world,'' Miss Lillie said.         In 1914, she was hired for a minor role in ''Not Likely,'' produced by Andre Charlot, a Frenchman who had brought to London, with great success, the concept of the little revue of fast-paced, sophisticated songs, skits and blackouts.         The young, bubbling Miss Lillie was besieged by hordes of stage-door Johnnies. The one who won her was the handsome Robert Peel, whose ancestor Sir Robert Peel served as one of Queen Victoria's Prime Ministers and organized London's Metropolitan police force. Its members were nicknamed ''bobbies'' after him. Wed at Family Estate         Miss Lillie was married to the future Sir Robert Peel at his family's estate, Drayton Manor, in 1920, but the bridegroom's parents stayed away, disapproving of ''theatrical folk.'' The couple's only child, also named Robert and called Little Bobbie, was born a year later.         A few months afterward, a bored Beatrice Lillie returned to the stage in Charlot's revue ''Now and Then.''         Miss Lillie's insistence on not giving up her career was dictated in part by economic necessity. Her husband was virtually penniless, a man who was never able to hold down a job and a gambler as well.         ''It was fortunate that I could trek back and forth across the Atlantic, earning a living for my son and husband,'' Miss Lillie said. The couple grew apart, and Sir Robert died of peritonitis at the age of 36, in 1934, in the home of his mistress. Son Killed in World War II         Miss Lillie's private world was shattered in 1942, when her son, who had enlisted in the Royal Navy, was killed in a Japanese air raid on the port of Colombo, Ceylon.         Miss Lillie spent much of the war entertaining troops in the Mediterranean region, Africa, the Middle East and, later, in Germany.         Over the years, she appeared in at least one revue a year, and sometimes two or three. Among them was ''This Year of Grace'' in 1928, written by and co-starring Sir Noel. One of Miss Lillie's most famous songs was ''Mad Dogs and Englishmen,'' introduced in her ''Third Little Show'' on Broadway in 1931. It became a standard in her repertory as well as in Sir Noel's.         In her 1972 autobiography, Miss Lillie told how another of her standards, ''There Are Fairies in the Bottom of My Garden,'' was introduced, against her will, into her repertory. Her friend Ethel Barrymore thought the song was a lovely, serious one, but Miss Lillie made it a side-splitter, especially when she sang it garbed in a long formal gown, then raised her skirt and roller-skated off stage. Radio Series in the 30's         Miss Lillie's Broadway and West End shows included ''Walk a Little Faster,'' ''The Show Is On,'' ''Happy Returns,'' even George Bernard Shaw's ''Too True to Be Good,'' one of her few straight plays, in which it was felt she was miscast. She made half a dozen movies and also had a radio series in the 1930's.         She toured the United States many times, in ''An Evening With Beatrice Lillie,'' ''Inside U.S.A.,'' and half a dozen other shows. Her friends were fond of telling the story about the time Miss Lillie and several chorus girls went to a beauty parlor in Chicago to have their hair done before an opening. An heiress to a meatpacking empire came in and informed the beauty salon's proprietor that she was ''mortified and infuriated to learn this establishment has been taken over by showgirls.''         As Miss Lillie left her booth, she loudly told the salon proprietor, in her most proper and meticulously enunciated English: ''You may tell the butcher's daughter that Lady Peel is finished.'' And she sailed out.         Beatrice Lillie was an original, but one who never took herself seriously. Once a reporter asked, ''Miss Lillie, what lies at the bottom of your art?''         ''There are fairies at the bottom of my art,'' she answered.         Miss Lillie left no immediate survivors.       
        Pegeen Fitzgerald, who, with her husband, Edward, conducted a radio talk show for 42 years and pioneered the at-home radio format, died of breast cancer Monday at her Manhattan home. She stated her age as 78 and also had a home in Kent, Conn.         Pegeen Fitzgerald, who, with her husband, Edward, conducted a radio talk show for 42 years and pioneered the at-home radio format, died of breast cancer Monday at her Manhattan home. She stated her age as 78 and also had a home in Kent, Conn.         ''The Fitzgeralds,'' subtitled ''Book Talk, Back Talk and Small Talk,'' was a radio institution, achieving at times an audience of 2 million listeners. It was broadcast mainly on WOR radio from the couple's 16th-floor apartment overlooking Central Park, and occasionally from their weekend homes in Hay Island, Conn., off Long Island Sound, and later from Kent, Conn., in the foothills of the Berkshires.         Mr. Fitzgerald died in 1982, at the age of 89, after 52 years of marriage, and Mrs. Fitzgerald continued a talk show on WOR and later on WNYC, until last April when she took a medical leave.         With ease and good humor, Mrs. Fitzgerald, a calm, homespun liberal, and Mr. Fitzgerald, a scholarly, theatrical conservative, bounced ideas, events and viewpoints off each other. Their casual preparation usually involved only glancing through newspapers and their mail. Cats and Commentary         Their only script was commercials, which they themselves styled, and they delivered them unobtrusively and at random. Their commentary, punctuated by the purring of their many cats, concerned the doings of friends and acquaintances and oddities in the news, and included occasional comments designed to shock bluenoses. The couple occasionally bickered on the air, but with wit and affection, in an effort to project the reality of their long marriage.         ''There is no easy way to describe what they do,'' Francis X. Clines wrote in The New York Times in 1979. ''They wool-gather and play off each other. They steep themselves daily in remembrances, using the airwaves as their Proustian bed.'' The husband often asked civility of the wife, and she responded by ''listening very carefully to him, correcting details, switching topics intuitively, reading the commercials elegantly and accurately.'' ''We're a true soap opera,'' she remarked to the reporter.         The loyalty of many listeners who regarded the Fitzgeralds as friends or part of their family frustrated some broadcast executives who tried to take them off the air several times. This loyalty extended to listeners who sent them their cats when entering nursing homes and others who willed their pets to the couple, who often had 10 cats in their apartment and 100 at their weekend home. Headed Animal Protection Groups         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's last years, she continued to maintain the Last Post, a shelter in Falls Village, Conn., and also aided many orphans, convicts and former convicts.         She said she believed deeply in antivivisection and ethical vegetarianism, refusing to eat meat or fish or to wear a fur coat ''because I don't want any living thing killed for my own use or pleasure.'' She headed two animal groups as president of the Vivisection Investigation League and as executive director of the Millenium Guild.         Mrs. Fitzgerald, a vivacious, stylish woman, has been described by friends as a gracious hostess who invariably kept champagne in her refrigerator for guests. From Portland to New York         Pegeen Fitzgerald was born Margaret Worrall in Norcatur, Kan., the eldest of seven children of Fred Calvin Worrall and the former Jane Sweeney, who were of French and Irish ancestry. In Pegeen's early teens, the family moved to Portland, Ore., where she graduated from high school at 15.         She attended the College of St. Theresa in Winona, Minn., but had to leave and seek work after two years when her father fell ill. She started to work in a Portland department store, rising from bookkeeper to advertising copywriter to assistant advertising manager. She married Mr. Fitzgerald in 1930.         He worked as a newspaper reporter and as a movie publicist, and entered radio in 1933 as a master of ceremonies for a variety show. The couple went to New York in 1936 and he joined WOR, where he gained success with a program on books and current events. She, meanwhile, was the advertising manager of McCreery's department store but, after several years, also joined WOR, where she had a talk show and then, in 1940, joined her husband and began broadcasting from their home.         Surviving are four sisters, Irene McAllister, of San Jose, Calif.; Cristine Sharkey, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; Eve Jane Mueller, of Portland, Ore.; and Mimi Findlay, of Martinez, Calif., and a brother, P. J. Worrall, of Alamo, Calif.       
        Dame Daphne du Maurier, the author of ''Rebecca'' and other highly popular Gothic and romantic novels that were turned into films, plays and documentaries, died yesterday in her sleep at home in the village of Par in Cornwall, on the rugged southwestern coast of England, a setting she had peopled with characters who were cherished by readers all over the world.         Dame Daphne du Maurier, the author of ''Rebecca'' and other highly popular Gothic and romantic novels that were turned into films, plays and documentaries, died yesterday in her sleep at home in the village of Par in Cornwall, on the rugged southwestern coast of England, a setting she had peopled with characters who were cherished by readers all over the world. She was 81 years old.         ''Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again . . . I came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that spread in all directions . . . There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.'' With 'Rebecca,' a Classic         With those famous opening lines of ''Rebecca,'' written by Miss du Maurier when she was 31, she created one of the classic Gothic romances. It is a story about a young woman who marries a widower and becomes the new mistress of a mansion haunted by the image of his first wife. Trying to solve the mystery, she is drawn into a psychological labyrinth. As the model for Manderley, Miss du Maurier used Menabilly, a 70-room manor on the Cornwall coast. Later, fulfilling a childhood dream, she and her husband moved into the mansion that had served as the setting for her novel.         One British critic called the novel ''a Charlotte Bronte story minus Bronte,'' but found it had its own appeal. Another critic, Basil Davenport, called it a ''melodrama, unashamed, glorying its own quality, such as we have hardly had since that other dependent, Jane Eyre, found that her house too had a first wife.'' In The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote, ''You know the end before you know the beginning; you never know the beginning until, almost, the end. That is a writer's art. Call it a trick, if you like; a trick performed as well as Miss du Maurier performs this trick is art.'' 'I Lose Myself in the Plot'         Long after the novel's international success, Miss du Maurier said she could never understand why it had become an instant favorite that eventually sold over a million hardcover copies. ''It is true that I immersed myself in the characters, especially in the narrator, but then this has happened throughout my writing career. I lose myself in the plot as it unfolds.''         All her life she received letters from readers about the characters in ''Rebecca,'' often asking why she did not give her heroine a Christian name. She explained, ''The answer is simple - I could not think of one, and it became a challenge in technique, the easier because I was writing in the first person.''         Although she had lived in Cornwall quietly, with occasional visits from her son and two daughters, to her neighbors she was known for her interest in protecting the integrity of the land and seascape around her against exploitation. Up to two weeks ago, she took her dog for daily walks along the beach. Several Films From Other Books         Friends said she carried her authorial fame and honors lightly. As the wife of Lieut. Gen. Sir Frederick A. M. Browning, who died in 1965 after serving as treasurer to the Duke of Edinburgh, she was also known as Lady Browning. In 1969, Miss du Maurier was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire.         In addition to ''Rebecca'' (the 1940 film that starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine), other movies adapted from her novels included ''Jamaica Inn'' (1939), ''Frenchman's Creek'' (1944), ''The Years Between'' (1946), ''Hungry Hill'' (1947) and ''My Cousin Rachel'' (1953). ''The Birds,'' directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1963, was based on a short story by Miss du Maurier that appeared in a collection, ''Kiss Me Again, Stranger.''         She also wrote a biography of her father, ''Gerald,'' a famous actor and theater manager; ''The du Mauriers,'' a family history; ''The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte, a biography of Patrick Branwell Bronte; and several plays - ''Rebecca,'' based on her novel; ''The Years Between'' and ''September Tide.'' The End as Beginning         Once, talking about the technique of her writing genre, she said, ''What is a suspense novel? The term is a loose one, covering any story from a whodunit to a frivolity turning on which dark stranger gets the blonde. People in doubt, people mystified, people groping their way from one situation to another, from childhood to middle age, from joy to sorrow - these are the figures in a true suspense novel. They are traveling along a road of uncertainty toward an unseen goal. The suspense novel succeeds if the reader says to himself at the final page, 'Yes - it couldn't happen any other way.' In its end, to paraphrase Mary, Queen of Scots, is its beginning.''         Miss du Maurier spoke of her writing without pretension, according to her friends. Asked if one of her novels was about ''boy meets girl,'' the author replied, ''No, it's ghoul meets goon.''         She is survived by a son, Christian Frederick du Maurier-Browning, and two daughters, Lady Tessa Montgomery and Lady Flavia Leng.

Elizabeth Henry, a founder of the Meals on Wheels program in this country, died Sunday of pneumonia. She was 86 years old.         In 1958 Ms. Henry and two other members of the Visiting Nurses Association started the program in Rochester, N.Y., after they had seen its success in England.         Ms. Henry, a past president of the National Dietetic Association, retired from the Visiting Nurses Association as a nutritionist in 1968.

Roberta Worrick, who wrote under the pen name Maria Thomas, was among the eight Americans killed last Monday in the crash of the airplane carrying United States Representative Mickey Leland of Texas. She lived in Addis Ababa; her age could not be learned last night.         Her husband, Tom, the deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development in Ethopia, was also killed in the crash.         Mrs. Worrick's novel, ''Antonia Saw the Oryx First,'' published by SoHo Press and distributed by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1987, drew critical praise for its depiction of the tensions between colonial whites and Africans on a continent buffeted by changes.         After the success of the novel, Soho Press issued ''Come to Africa and Save Your Marriage,'' Mrs. Worrick's collection of short stories in which she told of the difficulties of various people -Peace Corps volunteers, foreign academics, Indians, American blacks and white hunters left behind by colonial empires - in finding their way in black Africa.         Mr. Worrick and her husband went to Africa with the Peace Corps in 1971 and stayed on, pursuing their own careers. In addition Ethiopia, they lived in Tanzania, Liberia, Nigeria and Kenya.       
        Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         The Post's vice president for editorial and administration, Peter Faris, said she had died of cancer. Members of the Post staff said Mrs. Schiff had learned in May that she had cancer and had decided against being treated for it.         Mrs. Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker, used her family money to obtain the controlling stock of The Post in 1939. She sold it in 1976 to Rupert Murdoch, who sold it in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow.         Under her stewardship, the newspaper alternately made and lost money, and Mrs. Schiff constantly fretted that it would drive her into pauperdom. But she always managed to keep the newspaper afloat, seeing it outlast its competitors to become the only afternoon daily in New York City. She said in 1987 that she decided to sell the paper to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur, after The Post incurred heavy losses in the mid-1970's. Weak Competitor in '39         Mrs. Schiff bought a controlling interest in The Post in 1939 from J. David Stern at the urging of her second husband, George Backer. She had little business experience, and she later learned that she had assumed obligations for millions of dollars in severance pay if the paper closed.         Mrs. Schiff played only a peripheral role in the management of The Post in the first 10 years of her ownership. When she took active control, her new editor, James A. Wechsler, said the odds of its surviving were 1,000 to 1. Few would have challenged him. The Post was a weak third in the field of New York City afternoon dailies, behind The Journal-American and The World-Telegram, and it had been losing money for 20 years.         But the Post survived and prospered, becoming a liberal power in journalism while its powerful competitors collapsed, one by one. Even her critics agreed that most of the credit had to go to Mrs. Schiff. But they also said her success was partly attributable to personality traits for which they criticized her and to which she freely confessed: a fondness for gossip and scandal, a fear of becoming poor and a craving for power or, as she called it, influence. 'Men, Money & Magic'         Mrs. Schiff resumed her maiden name after her third divorce but decided that ''Mrs.'' was more appropriate than ''Miss'' for a grandmother. She described her private life in her diaries and other papers and in interviews. The book, ''Men, Money & Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,'' by Jeffrey Potter, was published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan in 1976.         Much of the book is devoted to her relationships with her husbands and male friends, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who persuaded her to build a home near his in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her biography suggested that their relationship had included sex and that it had been approved by Mr. Backer.         Mrs. Schiff came to regret what she called ''that awful book.'' In a statement volunteered for this obituary, she said, ''I want to make it very clear that President Roosevelt never made a suggestion that I become his girlfriend, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was just as good a friend as Mr. Roosevelt.'' Born on Fifth Avenue         Mrs. Schiff was born on March 11, 1903, in the Fifth Avenue apartment of her parents, Mortimer L. and Adele Neustadt Schiff. The apartment was a wedding gift from her grandfather, Jacob H. Schiff, a stern banker and the head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company.         As a girl, Dorothy - known to many as Dolly - was often treated coldly by her parents, each of whom had separate romantic and social interests. ''There was no joy in my growing up,'' she recalled. ''None, absolutely none.''         Later she would explain her refusal to grant bonuses or congratulations to Post staff members for good work by saying, ''They weren't given to me as a child, and any words I did receive were not ones of praise.''         She was, by her account, a bookish and sullen girl, associating solely with other young socialites at the Brearley School, Class of '20, on the Upper East Side. After her freshman year at Bryn Mawr College, where, she said, ''I flunked every single course, which is pretty hard to do,'' she set her heart on Richard B. W. Hall, a handsome socialite, though lacking in great wealth. Her parents opposed the match and, in classic fashion, sent her to Europe. But they finally yielded, in 1923. 'Rich at Last!'         Two children, Mortimer and Adele, were born in the first two years, but the marriage quickly turned cold.         After Mrs. Schiff's parents died in 1931, she said, she told her husband: ''My God, I'm rich at last! . . . And now I'm going to leave you.''         Mrs. Schiff said Mr. Hall had resented her Jewish origins as a social handicap. Shedding him, she abandoned a formal conversion to the Episcopal Church and gradually reverted to an old family concern for the fate of European Jewry.         She married Mr. Backer in 1932, because, Mrs. Schiff said, ''In those days, I thought it was important to be married, and since the substantial older ones had enough sense not to marry me, there wasn't much choice.'' Glamour and Politics         Until then, she had been, by her account, a socialite and a nominal Republican, interested chiefly in the glamour of the international set. He was a writer and a liberal Democrat, and he introduced her to the Algonquin Round Table and New Deal politics.         She joined the Roosevelt campaign in 1936 in a minor role and became active in welfare work. Three years later she gained control of The Post, ''with the understanding that I would pay the debts and the deficits,'' she said in 1987.         Mr. Backer became the nominal publisher and editor, and his wife was vice president and treasurer. She lost nearly $2 million the first two years as costs rose and circulation fell, to 190,000 from 250,000. Mrs. Schiff became terrified that the paper would bankrupt her.         She decided it needed a popular approach - a tabloid form, more comics and columns, and plenty of glamour, scandal and human-interest articles.         The features editor, Ted Thackrey, agreed. Mr. Backer did not. Marrying the Editor         Mrs. Schiff took over as publisher in 1942, separated from Mr. Backer and named Mr. Thackrey editor.         The publisher married the editor the next year, and while she was involved in buying radio and television stations, which were eventually sold, The Post under Mr. Thackrey was building circulation and cutting its losses.         The couple diverged on politics, and they publicized their disagreements in a series of columns during the 1948 Presidential campaign, he supporting the Progressive Party candidate, Henry A. Wallace, and she the Republican, Thomas E. Dewey. Both disliked Harry S. Truman, who won.         The Thackreys were divorced the next year. The Golden Age         To many readers and former Post staff writers, the era of James Wechsler's editorship, 1948 to 1961, was the newspaper's golden age. Talented reporters and columnists were hired, and although many features were about sex and celebrities, the paper also took on targets previously immune to critical coverage, like J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and Robert Moses.         From 1950 on, The Post was a money maker almost without interruption. But Mrs. Schiff never lost her sense of financial insecurity. She kept a tight rein on costs, gradually eliminating foreign and out-of-town coverage and permitting many skilled employees to leave for jobs that paid better.         She also kept a close watch on policy, conferring daily with department chiefs. Her decision in 1961 to name Paul Sann editor, making Mr. Wechsler the editorial page chief and a columnist, was generally perceived as favoring human interest over crusading.         As a publisher, she joined the strike-lockout that closed the daily newspapers in New York for 114 days beginning in December 1962. One month before the labor stoppage ended, she resumed publication because, she said, she had been snubbed in the negotiations by her male fellow publishers and because she feared that the continued stoppage might cause the death of weaker papers like The Post. Competition Dwindles         In fact, by 1966 The Daily Mirror had folded, and the morning New York Herald Tribune had merged with the big evening papers into The World Journal Tribune, familiarly dubbed The Widget.         ''I was petrified,'' Mrs. Schiff recalled. ''Here we had Jock Whitney, William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Jack Howard teaming up in the evening field.''         But an executive of the former Herald Tribune, Walter N. Thayer, reassured her, saying, ''It's an impossible three-headed thing.'' He was right. The paper closed a little more than a year later.         Mrs. Schiff then had the evening field to herself. She moved The Post from West Street to The Journal-American plant on South Street. She installed automated equipment and a spacious sixth-floor oval office for herself. The Sale to Murdoch         In December 1976, Mrs. Schiff startled the public and her staff by announcing the sale of The Post to Mr. Murdoch for $31 million. She did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed that she was pessimistic about the future of afternoon papers in the city.         ''The reason has been widely misconstrued,'' she said later in an interview. ''It was not sold for 'estate purposes.' Evening papers in urban areas have not survived. The Post had a deficit in 1975 and was a heavy loser in 1976, and I could no longer meet the deficits.''         In an interview last year, Mrs. Schiff said of her long ownership of the Post, ''It was a terrible headache.'' She said that she was then, in 1988, spending her time on needlepoint and other less stressful activities.         Mrs. Schiff married Rudolf Sonneborn, a Baltimore industrialist, in 1953. They separated in 1965 and were later divorced.         Surviving are the children of the first marriage, Mortimer W. Hall of Millbrook, N.Y., and Adele Hall Sweet, of Manhattan; a daughter from the second marriage, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, also of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
        Olga Erteszek, designer and founder of the Olga Company, which makes women's underwear and sleepwear, died of cancer Friday at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 73 years old.         Olga Erteszek, designer and founder of the Olga Company, which makes women's underwear and sleepwear, died of cancer Friday at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 73 years old.         Olga, as she was known professionally, is credited with several design innovations, including the seamless bra and the nightgown with a built-in bra. The nightgown evolved from a hospital stay for a slipped disk, she explained in an interview in The New York Times in 1966. She tested it during her convalescence, found it satisfactory and made it part of her line. It was an immediate success. ''This is comfort, security,'' she said at the time. ''This is hospital tested. I know.''         Her face as well as her name became familiar in a series of advertisements carrying her photograph and the slogan ''Behind every Olga there really is an Olga.'' A Rented Sewing Machine         The designer had immigrated to California from her native Krakow, Poland, in 1941 with her husband, Jan Erteszek, a lawyer. Shortly after arriving, they started a business with $10 and a rented sewing machine. Their first product was a lacy garter belt she had learned to make from her mother. Bullocks-Wilshire bought all the samples and the young couple were in business.         With Olga designing and her husband directing the business, the Olga Company reached a volume of $67 million when it was sold to Warnaco in 1984. Headquarters have remained in California. A daughter, Christina Johnson, is now design director of a line of lingerie for Warnaco called Olga's Christina, which is aimed at a younger, sports-oriented customer.         In addition to winning many industry awards, Olga and her husband were honored for their community and humanitarian work. In 1985, they received the California Industrialist of the Year Award for lifetime achievement. Mr. Erteszak died in 1986.         In addition to Christina Johnson, Olga is survived by two other daughters, Victoria Foote of New York City, and Mary Rudolph of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. tomorrow at the Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, Calif.       
        Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Miss Davis was en route to her home from the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain, where she had been honored for her acting career. She arrived in Paris on Tuesday and was to fly to Los Angeles, but was taken instead to the hospital, on the outskirts of Paris.         Her lawyer, Harold Schiff, said she had undergone a mastectomy in 1983.         ''The doctors had told us the cancer had spread, that it was terminal,'' he said. ''The doctors had said let her go on going about her business.'' #2 Oscars, 10 Nominations For more than a half century, Bette Davis reigned as a Hollywood star in the grandest meaning of the term. With her huge and expressive eyes, her flamboyant mannerisms and her distinctive speaking style, she left an indelible mark on her audiences in a wide variety of roles.         Nominated for 10 Oscars, Miss Davis was a perfectionist whose tempestuous battles for good scripts and the best production craftsmen for her films wreaked havoc in Hollywood executive suites.         ''I was a legendary terror,'' she once recalled. ''I was insufferably rude and ill-mannered in the cultivation of my career. I had no time for pleasantries. I said what was on my mind, and it wasn't always printable. I have been uncompromising, peppery, intractable, monomaniacal, tactless, volatile, and ofttimes disagreeable. I suppose I'm larger than life.''         She was indeed. Few in the entertainment industry could deny that Bette Davis possessed all the legendary indestructibility of the New England Yankee that she was. Starting as a stage actress, she won spectacular fame as a screen star and, as she grew old, shifted effortlessly to high-paying television roles.         Miss Davis's two Oscars for best performance by an actress were won in 1935, for ''Dangerous,'' and in 1938, for ''Jezebel.'' But perhaps she is best recalled for her tour de force as Margo Channing, the tough-talking but soft-hearted stage actress in ''All About Eve,'' for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.         She made almost 100 films. Her 10 nominations for Oscars are the most any actress has received. And she received many other honors, including the Life Achievement Award of the American Film Institute and the Cesar Award of the French film industry. In 1987 she received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievements in the performing arts.         The Kennedy Honors coincided with the release of ''The Whales of August,'' a film in which Miss Davis co-starred with Lillian Gish and for which she won wide critical praise. She appeared in that movie and in television and film roles despite having had a mastectomy and a series of strokes while hospitalized in 1983. ''It was my terror that I'd never work again,'' she said afterwards, ''for I have always very much loved to work.''         Last April 24, Miss Davis was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at its annual tribute, joining the company of such previous honorees as Sir Laurence Olivier and Charlie Chaplin. ''An honor I'm delighted to get,'' she said at the time. ''Greedy, greedy. Can't have too many awards. I've gotten just about every award there is.''  Enduring Popularity  'Acting Should Be Larger Than Life'         Although Miss Davis reached the apex of her popularity in films between the mid-1930's and the early 50's, her appeal swept across generations, due largely to her frequent appearances in made-for-television films and the repeated showings of her old, now-classic movies on television.         These classics include ''Of Human Bondage,'' ''Dark Victory,'' ''The Corn Is Green,'' ''The Letter,'' ''The Great Lie,'' ''A Stolen Life,'' ''Now, Voyager,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Petrified Forest'' and ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?''         New generations of entertainers, many of them female impersonators, have found her distinct mannerisms and clipped speech irresistible material for their acts.         ''Oh Petah, Petah, Petah,'' such an impersonator will say, rolling exaggeratedly widened eyes and puffing savagely on a cigarette. ''What a dump!'' And, inevitably, the memorable line that Margo Channing utters as she walks drunkenly up the stairs at her party: ''Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night.''         ''You know, I've learned from the imitators,'' Miss Davis said in an interview this year. ''I really have. I was never conscious I moved my elbow like that'' - she moved it from side to side - ''until I saw someone doing me.''         She was always proud of her approach to acting. ''Natural!'' she said. ''That isn't the point of acting. The public must believe us. They must also be somehow ennobled. Did I ever try to be low-key? Never, never, never! I fought that from the beginning. I think that acting should be larger than life.''  At First, Simply 'Betty'  A Broken Home And School Away         Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Mass., on April 5, 1908, Miss Davis came from a firmly rooted Yankee background. Her mother was the former Ruth Favor; her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, a Harvard Law School graduate who became a Government patent attorney.         Her father divorced her mother when Miss Davis was 7 and her sister, Barbara, was 5, leaving her mother to rear the children alone. In later years Miss Davis said many times that she saw the divorce as her father's abandonment of his family, and that it left her barren of love for him and preternaturally devoted to her doting mother.         Mrs. Davis put the girls in boarding school in Massachusetts and moved to New York. In 1917, she was joined by her daughters.         It was at about that time that ''Betty'' Davis took the more exotic-sounding name that would become world-famed. A friend of her mother's who was reading Balzac's ''La Cousine Bette'' suggested the name-spelling change, telling her that it would ''set you apart, my dear.''         In her teens, Miss Davis returned to New England, living in several towns there while her mother worked as a portrait photographer. She waited on tables at her schools, and once, to help with family expenses, posed nude for a woman making a sculpture.         Miss Davis decided in her teens that she wanted to become an actress, and her mother took her to New York in 1928, where she arranged for her to read for Eva Le Gallienne, whose Civic Repertory Theater was then one of the most popular touring companies.         ''Miss Le Gallienne thought I was not serious enough in my approach to warrant my attendance at her school,'' Miss Davis recalled years later.  Breaking Into the Business  Stage Experience, Looks and a Voice         Miss Davis's first professional acting job was with a winter stock company in Rochester, run by the director George Cukor, who dismissed her after a few months. She made her New York acting debut in 1929, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village, in Virgil Geddes's ''The Earth Between.'' Brooks Atkinson, critic for The New York Times, wrote that she was ''an entrancing creature.''         Successes and disappointments were to come in rapid order after that. The young actress, then only 21 years old, was in her first Broadway hit, ''Broken Dishes,'' quickly followed by ''Solid South,'' in which she played the beguilingly named Alabama Follensby, the first of many Southern-belle roles that were to come her way.         The movies had learned to talk only a few years earlier, and Hollywood was greedily spiriting away Broadway actors and actresses who had good speaking voices as well as looks. It was thus perhaps inevitable that a fresh young actress with some training and experience and a couple of good notices would be asked to take a screen test.         She was given a $300-a-week contract by Universal Pictures, and Miss Davis and her mother went to Los Angeles in 1930. Her first movie role was in ''Bad Sister,'' notable only for the fact that it also introduced Humphrey Bogart to films. But the movie's cinematographer, Karl Freund, passed the word to studio bosses that ''Davis has lovely eyes,'' and just as she was to be dropped, her option was picked up for another 13 weeks.         By the end of 1932, Miss Davis, discouraged after having appeared in six lackluster movies and finally without a contract, prepared to return with her mother to New York. Then she got a call from George Arliss, the highly respected English actor, who was to be her mentor until his death.         He hired Miss Davis as his leading lady in ''The Man Who Played God,'' her breakthrough movie role.         The film was a success, and its producer, Warner Brothers, signed Miss Davis to her first contract. It was the start of a love-hate relationship with the studio that was characterized by Miss Davis's frequent storming off sets, being suspended for refusing to act in what she considered inferior movies, and going to court to sever her ties with Warners.         But in her first three years at Warners Miss Davis made 14 films, including Edna Ferber's ''So Big,'' with Barbara Stanwyck starring, and ''20,000 Years in Sing Sing,'' which was, she was to say, ''my only film with the great Spencer Tracy, to my everlasting regret.''         ''He was the finest actor I ever worked with,'' she said.  Getting Parts, and Noticed  Unafraid to Play The Villainess         She was working hard, in mostly forgettable fare, but Miss Davis was also learning the movie craft and earning the respect of technicians.         From the start Miss Davis, unlike leading ladies of the day, had no qualms about playing unsympathetic roles, and so was overjoyed in 1934 when she was lent by Warners to the rival RKO studios to play the cruel and slatternly waitress Mildred in W. Somerset Maughham's ''Of Human Bondage,'' opposite Leslie Howard as the crippled hero Philip.         ''Every actor who becomes a star is usually remembered for one or two roles,'' she said, ''like Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz', Garbo in 'Camille,' Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire.' Mildred in 'Of Human Bondage' was such a role for me. She was the first leading-lady villainess ever played on a screen for real.''         ''It's odd that people remember me best for my evil roles,'' she said, ''since I played so many other kinds of characters. But villains always have the best-written parts.''         She was widely praised for her performance as Mildred and nominated for an Academy Award, but she failed to win one, mostly, she said, because Warner Brothers did not want to promote an Oscar for a film it did not produce. She came to regard the Oscar that she won the next year, for ''Dangerous,'' as ''a consolation prize.''         She was always proud of her two Oscars, though, and said this year: ''I'm not a bit modest about them. I don't use those boys for door stops.''         Warners was treating her with new respect, giving her movies like ''The Petrified Forest,'' with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, but Miss Davis harbored a festering resentment against what she called ''the contract slave system'' at the studio.         Deciding in 1936 to defy the strictures of her contract, Miss Davis agreed with an English company to go to London to make two movies. Years later she was to ruefully confess that before she left, Jack L. Warner, the studio head, offered her a chance ''to play one of the great screen roles of all time, but I didn't know it.''         '' 'Please don't leave. I just bought a wonderful book for you,' '' she quoted Mr. Warner as saying. ''And I said, 'I'll bet it's a pip!' and walked out of his office.'' She learned later that the role she turned down was Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' Mr. Warner later gave up his option on it.  The Glorious Years  Memorable Roles, One After Another         In England, Miss Davis was sued by Warner Brothers, which succeeded in preventing her from working for another producer while under contract to Warners. But once she had returned to the United States, Warners gave her a new contract calling for fewer pictures at a much higher salary.         They also gave her excellent, high-budget pictures, like ''Jezebel,'' for which she won her second Oscar in 1938. In a single year, 1939, Warners released no fewer than four blockbuster Davis movies: ''Dark Victory,'' ''Juarez,'' ''The Old Maid'' and ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex,''         ''Jezebel'' began her halcyon years, she said, and ''in 1939 I secured my career and my stardom forever; I made five pictures in 12 months, and every one of them made money.''         The memorable Davis roles continued in swift order: The murderous and unfaithful planter's wife in Maugham's ''The Letter'' in 1940, quickly followed the next year by ''The Great Lie'' and ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the scheming Regina Giddens. In 1942 she scored again in ''Now, Voyager,'' as Charlotte Vale, a frumpish spinster who blossoms into a confident beauty and finds true love with Paul Henreid. The film is remembered by movie buffs for the scenes in which Mr. Henreid lights two cigarettes at once and gives one to Miss Davis.         There were other triumphs in the 1940's - ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' ''Watch on the Rhine,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''A Stolen Life.'' But Miss Davis's luck began to run out with critical and box-office disasters like ''Winter Meeting'' and ''Deception,'' and in 1949 Warner Brothers, after 19 years, released her from her contract while she was making the ludicrous melodrama ''Beyond the Forest.'' In it a by-then plumpish Miss Davis uttered one of her most famous ''camp'' lines, so often used by her mimics, ''What a dump!''  Anguish and Acclaim  Role of a Lifetime In 'All About Eve'         With the end of the Warners era, Miss Davis's third marriage, to William Grant Sherry, an artist by whom she had a daughter, Barbara Davis Sherry, was also ending. She won custody of her daughter.         Miss Davis had previously been married to Harmon Oscar Nelson Jr., a band leader, and she said in 1982 that on his insistence she had two abortions. ''That's what he wanted,'' she said. ''Being the dutiful wife, that's what I did.'' The marriage ended in divorce.         But for decades afterward, Miss Davis publicly battled with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, insisting that she had bestowed her first husband's middle name on the Oscar. ''The Academy has fought stoically to claim that they named the Oscar,'' she said. ''But of course I did. I named it after the rear end of my husband. Why? Because that's what it looked like.''         Miss Davis's second husband, Arthur Farnsworth, a businessman, died of head injuries suffered in a fall in 1943.         Miss Davis was filming ''Payment on Demand'' in 1949 - it was not released until 1951 - when she was offered a role of a lifetime in what she was to call ''that charmed movie, 'All About Eve.' '' She was a last-minute replacement for Claudette Colbert, for whom the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, had written the role of Margo Channing, the fading Broadway star. Miss Colbert was unable to begin the film on schedule because she ''hurt her back, thank God,'' as Miss Davis liked to recall it.         ''When I finished reading 'All About Eve' I was on Cloud Nine,'' said the actress. ''That night Joe Mankiewicz told me Margo Channing was the kind of dame who would treat her mink coat like a poncho.''         She played Margo that way, and brilliantly, and with the aid of a witty, literate script, sharp direction by Mr. Mankiewicz, and a sparkling cast that included Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, George Sanders, Marilyn Monroe (in a supporting role), and Thelma Ritter, the movie became one of the all-time great Hollywood films.         During the filming of ''All About Eve,'' Miss Davis became romantically involved with her leading man, Gary Merrill, and they were married in 1950. Soon afterward they adopted two children, Margot and Michael.  The 'Darkest Decade'  A Broadway Flop, A Retreat to Maine         Miss Davis received another Oscar nomination for ''The Star,'' released in 1953, but the film was unsuccessful. She was by then 45 and younger actresses were being offered the parts that would have once been hers. She accepted an offer to return to Broadway in a revue, ''Two's Company.''         When the show opened in New York in December 1952, Miss Davis recalled years later, ''The ovation was, to say the least, heartwarming, the reviews were bloodcurdling.'' The revue closed after 90 performances.         Miss Davis and Mr. Merrill took an option to buy a home in Maine and, she said with wry amusement, ''We called our house Witch Way because we didn't know which way we were going and a witch lived there. Guess who?''         ''For three years I was solely a wife and mother and Gary fell out of love with me,'' Miss Davis was to say years later. During that period it also became apparent that the Merrills' adopted daughter, Margot, was retarded, and at the age of 3 she had to be put in a special school. Margot has since lived in homes for the retarded.         During what she was to call her ''darkest decade,'' the 1950's, while the the Merrills' marriage continued to disintegrate, Miss Davis again played Elizabeth I in ''The Virgin Queen'' and a year later, in 1956, appeared in Paddy Chayefsky's ''A Catered Affair'' as Ma Hurley, a Bronx housewife, which she sometimes said was her favorite role. The Merrills also traveled cross-country doing one-night stands in ''The World of Carl Sandburg'' until 1960, when they were divorced.  Friends and Enemies  Fonda, Crawford, Cagney and Flynn         Having settled into character acting, Miss Davis in 1961 scored a success as the gin-soaked ''bag lady'' Apple Annie in ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' That same year she was praised for her performance on Broadway in Tennessee Wiliams's ''The Night of the Iguana,'' which she left in April 1962 to film ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' a box-office winner that earned her yet another Accademy Award nomination for best actress of the year.         The horror movie, in which Miss Davis wore pasty white makeup and padded herself to appear overweight, revolved around two show-business has-been sisters living in creepy seclusion in a Hollywood mansion. The role of the loony Baby Jane Hansen, addled into thinking she was going to make a comeback in vaudeville, gave Miss Davis a chance to pull out all the acting stops, and she did so with relish. The other, wheelchair-bound, sister was played by Joan Crawford.         The casting of Miss Davis and Miss Crawford in ''Baby Jane'' resuscitated longstanding rumors that they had feuded when both were Warners stars. In 1982 Miss Davis told an interviewer, ''I never feuded with Joan Crawford. During 'Baby Jane' the whole world hoped we would fight but we did not. We were both pros.'' In any event, Miss Davis was not reticent about revealing her rancor against other performers. She accused Miriam Hopkins, with whom she co-starred in ''The Old Maid'' and ''Old Acquaintance,'' of upstaging her and scene-stealing. She also disliked Errol Flynn, her co-star in ''Elizabeth and Essex,'' calling him ''unprofessional.''         Intense as her rivalries were, her friendships were deep and long lasting, particularly for Claude Rains, Henry Fonda, James Cagney, Paul Henreid, Olivia de Havilland, Anne Baxter and Geradine Fitzgerald.         As she grew older, Miss Davis continued making movies, many of them horror thrillers or melodramas, like ''The Anniversary'' (1968), in which she wore a patch over one eye.         Unlike many of her contemporaries who held out against appearing on television when it was in its infancy in the 1950's, Miss Davis embraced it. She appeared as a guest on the Jimmy Durante comedy show, and made episodes of popular series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Perry Mason.''  Writing Her Own Epitaph  'The Sweetness Of My Joy'         Despite advancing age Miss Davis kept on working, appearing on television and in an occasional movie, some of them made for television. She said she worked into her later years because the money came in handy, and work was part of her Yankee heritage. ''It is only work that truly satisfies,'' she said. ''No one has ever understood the sweetness of my joy at the end of a good day's work. I guess I threw everything else down the drain.''         This included her personal life, she said, adding: ''All my marriages were charades, and I was equally responsible. But I always fell in love. That was the original sin.''         It was never a secret that Miss Davis was temperamental, opinionated and often difficult to get along with, but in 1985 a scandalous book about her, by her own daughter, shocked her critics as well as her fans.         In ''My Mother's Keeper,'' B. D. Hyman portrayed Miss Davis as an abusive, domineering and hateful mother and as a grotesque alcoholic who was largely responsible for her own mistreatment by certain of her husbands. Two years later Miss Davis replied to Mrs. Hyman's charges with her own bestseller, 'This 'N That,'' in which she defended herself as the victim of a lying and ungrateful child. She confessed later that her estrangement from her daughter pained her.         For some years after her last divorce Miss Davis lived in Weston, Conn., but in the late 1970's she moved into an apartment in West Hollywood.         ''Indestructible,'' she once said. ''That's the word that's often used to describe me. I suppose it means that I just overcame everything. But without things to overcome, you don't become much of a person, do you?''         ''I know what I want as my epitaph,'' she said. ''Here lies Ruth Elizabeth Davis - she did it the hard way.''         Correction:  November 11, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Oct. 8 about Bette Davis credited her incorrectly with a distinction held by another actress.         As a letter from a reader has pointed out, it is Katharine Hepburn who has received the most Academy Award nominations. The obituary also included a film incorrectly among Miss Davis's nominations. She was not nominated for the 1934 film ''Of Human Bondage.''       
        Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Miss Terris played Magnolia in the Florenz Ziegfeld production of the hit musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Opening in 1927, the show ran on Broadway for two and a half years with Miss Terris, who was critically acclaimed for her lovely voice and charming acting.         While she was rehearsing for ''Show Boat,'' Kern and Hammerstein wrote a song for her, ''Why Do I Love You?'' one of the musical's enduring songs. She repeated her success in a 1932 revival on Broadway.         While she went on to other roles in the musical theater, Miss Terris remained linked to her most glittering triumph and never surpassed it. For 10 years in the 1930's and 1940's, she was a star of the Municipal Opera Company of St. Louis, appearing in plays by Noel Coward and Moss Hart. She also acted in Hollywood films in the 1930's. Role as a Patron         By the end of the 1940's, she moved gracefully into the role of patron of the musical theater. A 30-year member of the board of the Goodspeed Opera House Foundation, in Chester, Conn., Miss Terris sang there occasionally and supported the theater.         In 1984, the Goodspeed opened the Norma Terris Theater in her honor, dedicated to developing new musicals. Miss Terris performed a one-woman show of impersonations of great musical-comedy stars, donating the proceeds to the center. Later, she established a fund to encourage performing artists and composers and endowed an intern program at the Goodspeed Opera House, which aids young people starting theatrical careers.         Miss Terris, a devoted animal lover, donated 30 acres of land in East Haddam, Conn., as a nature center and regional office for the Humane Society.         She was born in Columbus, Kan., to a singer, who named her after the Bellini opera ''Norma.'' She got her first show business break in the title role of George M. Cohan's ''Little Nellie Kelly.''         She is survived by her husband, Albert D. Firestone.       
        Silvana Mangano, the Italian film actress who created a sensation as a passionately earthy peasant in ''Bitter Rice'' in 1948 and shaped increasingly compelling characterizations in later movies, died yesterday in Madrid. She was 59 years old and had been hospitalized in a coma for several days.         Silvana Mangano, the Italian film actress who created a sensation as a passionately earthy peasant in ''Bitter Rice'' in 1948 and shaped increasingly compelling characterizations in later movies, died yesterday in Madrid. She was 59 years old and had been hospitalized in a coma for several days.         Representatives of the Luz Hospital in Madrid told The Associated Press that the actress had suffered a heart attack there during surgery for a tumor between her lungs. She had been suffering from cancer for several years.         Miss Mangano's three daughters, Veronica, Rafaella and Francesca, flew to Madrid to be with her, the Spanish National Radio reported. Federico, the actress's only son, died in a plane crash in 1981 while making a film in Alaska, prompting her to go into seclusion for several years.         Their father is Dino De Laurentiis, the producer whom Miss Mangano married in 1949 soon after the release of ''Bitter Rice,'' his first international success. They avoided publicity in their private lives and seemed happy, but they separated in 1983 and began divorce proceedings last year. Made 30 Films         The actress worked with many of Italy's leading directors, including Alberto Lattuada, Vittorio De Sica, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Luchino Visconti, but she made only 30 films, preferring to spend time with her family.         Her roles included a sensitive prostitute in ''Gold of Naples'' (1954), a loveless movie goddess in ''The Witches'' (1967), a cool aristocrat in ''Death in Venice'' (1971) and the wealthy, rejected wife of Marcello Mastroianni in ''Dark Eyes'' (1987). Other films were ''Ulysses'' (as both Penelope and Circe, 1954), ''Barabbas'' (1961), ''Oedipus Rex'' (1967), ''Ludwig'' (1973) and ''Conversation Piece'' (1975).         Miss Mangano was born in Rome on April 21, 1930, one of four children of Amedeo Mangano, a railroad employee, and an Englishwoman, the former Ivy Webb. She studied dancing, won the title Miss Rome 1946 in a beauty contest, modeled and got minor parts in several movies before gaining the leading role in ''Bitter Rice'' as a lustful rice harvester in the Po Valley. Contrast to Private Life         Bosley Crowther of The New York Times reflected international approval in hailing her as a sensation. He said she embodied ''Anna Magnani minus 15 years, Ingrid Bergman with a Latin disposition and Rita Hayworth plus 25 pounds.''         David Thomson, the film historian and critic, said in recalling ''Bitter Rice'' that its social comment ''was swamped by its popular elements, chief of which was Mangano, her skirts tucked up, standing in the rice fields and leaving no doubts in the viewer's mind.''         Miss Mangano's sensual film image contrasted with her private life, in which she wore conservative clothes and no makeup. In her maturity, she was a cool, sculptured, high-fashion beauty whose penchants included tennis, horseback riding and well-prepared food.         Besides her children, survivors include two sisters, Patrizia and Natasha.         The hospital gave no information regarding funeral or memorial services. The Spanish national news agency EFE quoted a family representative as saying Miss Mangano's body would be cremated today and the remains sent to New York to be placed next to those of her son.
