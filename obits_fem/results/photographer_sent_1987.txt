Not long after, she managed an art gallery in Manhattan for the late photographer Alfred Stieglitz.
The latter was a joint exhibition with her daughter, the photographer Ruth Orkin, who was best-known for her photographs of Central Park before her death in 1985.
Her son, Joseph, is a photographer in Paris, and her daughter, Monika, lives in New York City.
She also edited works by John Ciardi, Svetlana Alliluyeva, Joseph Alsop, William Stafford, Ted Hughes and the photographer Walker Evans.
