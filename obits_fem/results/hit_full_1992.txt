         Elizabeth Ogg Walters, the author of many public affairs studies, died on Jan. 14 at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, after having been hit on Dec. 1 by a bus near her Fifth Avenue residence, said Arnold Allentuch, her executor and friend.  Mrs. Walters, who used the pen name, Elizabeth Ogg, wrote nearly 50 pamphlets dealing mainly with mental health and social problems for the Public Affairs Committee, Inc. of New York City. Her widely cited pamphlets include: "Your Nursing Services Today and Tomorrow," "A New Chapter in Family Planning," "When a Family Faces Stress" and "Good News for Stroke Victims."         British-born and educated, she came to the United States when she was 24, taught English at a private school and later became editor of Headline Books for the Foreign Policy Association. During World War II, she worked for the Office of War Information, writing instruction manuals on sonar gear for the United States Navy.         The author of several books, her latest work, "Facing Death and Loss," was published in 1985 by the Technomic Publishing Company of Switzerland.         She is survived by a nephew, Peter Ogg, and a niece, Alma Ogg of Prudhoe, Northumberland, England.       
         Helen Deutsch, the award-winning screenwriter for "Lili," "I'll Cry Tomorrow" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and co-author of "National Velvet," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 years old.         She had been under nursing care and died of natural causes, the medical examiner's office said.         Her script for "Lili" was nominated for an Academy Award in 1953 and won Cannes Film Festival and Writers Guild of America prizes and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Golden Globe award.         The film told of an orphan, played by Leslie Caron, smitten with a carnival magician. One critic, Bosley Crowther, called the movie "lovely and beguiling" and "touched with the magic of romance and the shimmer of masquerade." It later became a musical hit, "Carnival!" on Broadway.         Miss Deutsch, who never learned to type and instead relied on a old Dictaphone, was prolific. Besides her 15 screenplays, she wrote more than 20 short stories for magazines, hundreds of newspaper articles and several plays and television scripts. She was a lyricist as well. Among her songs was "Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo," which she dismissed as "dreadful." Organized Drama Critics Circle         Although not a performer, she played many other roles in show business. Early in her career she ran a theater company, worked as a publicist and covered theater for The New York Herald-Tribune and The New York Times. As a protest to the Pulitzer Prize selections, she organized the New York Drama Critics Circle. She also worked for the New York Theater Guild, and later was a production consultant for stage, film and television.         Her screenwriting career started with a smash. "National Velvet" (1944), which was about youngsters training a horse, was named one of the 10 best films that year and propelled the young Elizabeth Taylor to stardom.         That same year she followed with another acclaimed work, "The Seventh Cross," in which Spencer Tracy gave one of the best performances of his career, portraying a refugee from a Nazi death camp.         Most of her screenplays were for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and were adaptations of other works. Her range was wide, from psychological drama to outdoor adventure to musicals.         "I'll Cry Tomorrow" (1956), featuring Susan Hayward, was the true story of Lillian Roth's searing battle with alcoholism. "King Solomon's Mines" (1950) with Stewart Granger was a scenic safari picture. "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" (1964) was a big, brassy musical about a survivor of the Titanic, and the movie garnered six Oscar nominations.         But her film-writing career ended on a sour note. "Valley of the Dolls" (1967) was a steamy box office success but critically scorned. Miss Deutsch disavowed authorship and said Jacqueline Susann, on whose novel the movie was based, had meddled with the script.         For television she wrote "Jack and the Beanstalk," starring Joel Grey, for NBC in 1956. The following year she wrote "The General Motors 50th Anniversary Show."         Miss Deutsch was born in Manhattan and graduated from Barnard College in 1927. While still a senior, she started managing the Provincetown Players, continuing till the troupe went out of business. She co-wrote a book about it in 1931, "The Provincetown," which was republished in 1972. She took up freelance writing, and her stories appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Redbook.         When Hollywood beckoned, she went to California, living there from about 1946 to 1966. Returning to the East Coast, she called herself "a recluse in New York."         Miss Deutsch was a student of medieval English, French, German and English and a Sanskrit scholar. She collected rare books and manuscripts and donated a significant collection to Boston University.         She had a brief marriage that was annulled. There are no immediate survivors.

         La Lupe, a singer who was known during the late 1960's as the Queen of Latin Soul, died on Feb. 28 at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She was 53 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said.         La Lupe had a raspy voice and an uninhibited stage presence; she shook her long hair, shimmied in low-cut dresses and tossed her beads and shoes to the crowds. A string of hits she made with the bandleader Tito Puente in the mid-1960's established her as one of the most popular performers in Latin music.         La Lupe was born Lupe Victoria Yoli in Santiago, a village in Oriente Province in Cuba. At her parents' insistence, she earned a teaching degree, but she had also been winning local singing contests, and decided to go into performing. She married a singer in the trio Los Tropicuba; after her first performance, he said he thought she was having an epileptic fit. She soon divorced him and began working on her own, and by 1960 she was a leading performer in Havana nightclubs. She bought her own club, but after difficulties with the Fidel Castro Government -- "Castro take my club, my money, my car," she told Look magazine in 1971 -- she emigrated to the United States, and settled in New York in 1962. The Making of a Star         Soon after she arrived, she began singing with orchestras led by Mongo Santamaria and Mr. Puente, with whom she recorded a number of hit singles, including "Que Te Pedi." By the end of the 1960's, she was a star in her own right, working with Mr. Puente and with other bandleaders, and touring the United States and Latin America.         In the mid-1970's, her jobs in New York City dwindled, and she moved to Puerto Rico, where she played concerts and television programs. She returned to New York, but her career had declined and her second husband's medical expenses depleted her savings. By the early 1980's she was living on welfare. In 1984, while hanging a curtain, she fell, injured her spine and was paralyzed; not long afterward, an electrical fire burned down her house. She sang with Mr. Puente for the last time in 1985, from a wheelchair, at a concert to help pay her expenses.         According to Vernon Boggs's "Salsiology," a history of salsa in New York published by Excelsior and Greenwood, La Lupe regained her ability to walk after being blessed by an evangelical Christian preacher. She began singing Christian music, performing regularly at Iglesia Pentecostal el Fin Se Acerca (Pentecostal Church: The End is Near) in the Bronx. She also recorded a series of albums in salsa and Mexican styles with devotional lyrics.         She is survived by her son, Rene Camano, and her daughter, Rainbow Garcia, both of the Bronx.       
         Ruth Hammond, an actress whose career on Broadway spanned half a century, died in her sleep on Thursday, her 96th birthday, at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J.         Miss Hammond created the role of Cora in the 1939 hit play "Life With Father" and remained in the cast for the entire run of the show, missing only one performance in seven and a half years. Her first appearance on Broadway was in 1920 in "The Ouija Board"; her other credits included "Saturday's Children" with Ruth Gordon and "The Good Fairy" with Helen Hayes, as well as "Winterset," "The Women" and "Life With Mother."         Miss Hammond was born in Los Angeles, and was a graduate of the University of California in Berkeley. In addition to her acting, she was an artist known for portraits and caricatures.         She is survived by a son, Eric McDonald, of Langhorn, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Elisabeth Marton, an agent who represented foreign playwrights in the United States and American playwrights overseas, died at her home in Manhattan on Monday. She was 90 years old.         Ms. Marton died of a stroke, said Morton D. Stone, her companion.         She was born in Budapest, the daughter of an international copyright lawyer, Sandor Marton, who was a pioneering literary agent with clients including Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Thompson and Thornton Wilder.         After being imprisoned by the pro-Nazi regime in Hungary during World War II, Ms. Marton came to the United States, and by 1953 began to work as a theatrical agent for European writers in collaboration with her brother, George, who was living in Paris.         She was also active in arranging for foreign productions of American plays and musicals. Among the Broadway shows she sent around the world were "Man of La Mancha," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Same Time, Next Year," "Agnes of God" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning " 'Night, Mother."         Her most notable Broadway hit was the musical "La Cage aux Folles" in 1983. Ms. Marton represented the French author of the original play, Jean Poiret. She also represented the original works on which "Grand Hotel" and "She Loves Me" were based.         Ms. Marton came to public attention in 1985 when she represented the estate of a young Hungarian woman who joined the British Army in World War II and parachuted into Yugoslavia to help rescue downed British fliers and Jews from the Nazis. Eventually, she was captured, tortured and executed. Her story was turned into the play "Hannah Senesh," by David Schechter.         Ms. Marton is survived by three nieces, Tonda Marton-Beyer of Manhattan; Marie Mullholland of Portland, Ore., and Eva Lafer of Los Angeles.         A memorial service is to be announced.       
         Sylvia Syms, one of the most admired pop-jazz singers of her generation, died of a heart attack in Manhattan early yesterday morning after a performance in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel. Moments after she had finished singing a program of songs associated with her longtime friend Frank Sinatra, the 74-year-old singer and actress collapsed and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.         "It was at the very end of the second show, and she was getting a standing ovation," said Steve La Spina, her bass player. "She put her right hand up, and the next thing we knew she fell back and hit the ground."         With her deep, grainy contralto, I've-been-through-it-all air of sophistication, and sinuous phrasing that echoed her idol, Billie Holiday, Miss Syms was a quintessential saloon singer, a term she said she preferred to cabaret singer. In the saloon tradition of Mr. Sinatra, she treated everything she sang as an intimate personal communication.         "When you perform it's a one-to-one love affair with the people out there," she once said. "That's how it has to be."         Although she enjoyed only one bona fide pop hit, "I Could Have Danced All Night," from the musical "My Fair Lady," in 1956, among musicians and a coterie of admirers she had a stature that was matched by perhaps only a dozen other veteran popular singers.         Foremost among those admirers was Mr. Sinatra, who produced and conducted her 1982 album of standards, "Syms by Sinatra," for Reprise Records. Not long after they met in the 1940's, Mr. Sinatra gave the plump, moon-faced singer the nickname "Buddha." She in turn referred to him by his full name, Francis Albert. Miss Syms took credit for giving Billie Holiday her trademark gardenia as camouflage after the legendary jazz singer had burned her hair with a curling iron.         Miss Syms was born on Dec. 2, 1917, in Flatbush, Brooklyn. She was only 15 years old when she discovered the jazz clubs of West 52d Street and became friendly with many of the musicians who performed in them. She inaugurated her nightclub career at Kelly's Stable in 1941. Five years later, she made her first recording, "I'm in the Mood for Love," with the Freddie Greene Band. The Clubs and the Labels         It was while appearing at the Cinderella Club in Greenwich Village in 1948 that she was discovered by Mae West, who gave her the part of Flo the Shoplifter in a revival of "Diamond Lil." Favorable notices from the show helped propel her into a dual career in nightclubs and the theater. Her musical comedy roles included Bloody Mary in regional productions of "South Pacific" and Dolly Gallagher Levi in a regional production of "Hello, Dolly!" Her favorite stage role was Gypsy in Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," which she performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and later at Lincoln Center.         In a nightclub career that spanned 51 years, the New York rooms in which she performed included the Bon Soir, the Ruban Bleu, the Living Room, the Village Vanguard, the Cafe Carlyle, Freddy's, Michael's Pub, the Cookery, Marty's, and Eighty-Eight's.         Miss Syms recorded 15 albums for Decca, Columbia, Atlantic and Prestige, among other labels. Her most recent recording, "Along Came Bill," a tribute to the jazz pianist Bill Evans, was released in 1990 on DRG. She recently completed her final recording, "You Must Believe in Spring: The Words of Alan and Marilyn Bergman," which Cabaret Records is to release next month.         She is survived by a brother, Burton Blagman, of Wyckoff, N.J., and a sister, Muriel Bailey of Chesterfield, Mo.         A funeral service is to be held today at 2:30 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
         Mai-mai Sze, a painter and author, died in New York Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 82 years old.         Ms. Sze died of throat cancer, said Jean B. Angell, a close friend who was her lawyer.         The daughter of a former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Ms. Sze was born in China but was educated at the National Cathedral School in Washington and graduated from Wellesley College in 1931.         After college, she became a successful landscape painter, and her works were exhibited at shows in New York, London and Paris. Her drawing of Eugene O'Neill was used on book jackets, on the theater program for his play "The Iceman Cometh" and on the cover of Newsweek magazine.         In 1936, she appeared as a narrator called the "Honorable Reader" in the Broadway hit "Lady Precious Stream," a love story set in ancient China.         From 1937 until the end of World War II, she lectured on China and organized the first Chinese War Relief Committee in New York. During this period she also wrote a column for The New York Post and contributed articles to a number of national magazines.         Ms. Sze began publishing both fiction and nonfiction books in 1945. These included "Echo of a Cry" (1945), "Silent Children" (1948), a novel about dispossessed children in an imaginary country, and a philosophical work, "The Tao of Painting" (1960).         Ms. Sze is survived by three sisters, Julia Sze Bailey of Manhattan, Betty Sze O'Neill of Poughkeepsie and Alice Sze Wang of Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, Dr. Szeming Sze of Pennsylvania and Florida.       
         Anna Johnstone Robinson, who designed the costumes for many major films and Broadway shows and was nominated for Academy Awards for "The Godfather" and "Ragtime," died on Friday at the Kimball Farms nursing home in Lenox, Mass. She was 79 years old and lived in the Bronx and Canaan, N.Y.         She died after a long illness whose nature was not disclosed, a funeral home spokesman said.         Mrs. Robinson, who worked under her maiden name, Anna Hill Johnstone, designed the costumes for more than 60 films. Tricks of the Trade         Her movies included "Serpico," "The Wiz," "On the Waterfront," "East of Eden," "America, America," "Prince of the City," "The Verdict," "Running on Empty," "Baby Doll," "Edge of the City," "Dog Day Afternoon" and "A Face in the Crowd."         While preparing for the filming of "The Group" in 1965, Mrs. Robinson divulged some tricks of her craft. She combed through the closets and attics of friends in Riverdale and scrounged through thrift shops on the East Side of Manhattan looking for just the right clothes for the story's era.         Sometimes she cheated a bit on authenticity. For one outfit, satin had to be substituted for the scripted taffeta, for example, to avoid making distracting rustling sounds that would ruin the soundtrack.         Mrs. Robinson got started by helping with student productions in college, then became a seamstress for summer stock stage shows.         Her first full credit for costume design was for the 1937 Broadway hit "Having Wonderful Time." Her other stage productions included "Bell, Book and Candle," "Lost in the Stars," "Tea and Sympathy," "The Tender Trap" and "A Streetcar Named Desire."         Turning to movies in 1948, Mrs. Robinson got her first film credit as a costume designer for "Portrait of Jennie." She continued doing movies for 40 years, frequently working for the directors Elia Kazan and Sidney Lumet. She also designed costumes for some television shows.         Born in Greenville, S.C., Mrs. Robinson grew up in Richmond. She graduated from Barnard College in 1934, and 40 years later received an honorary degree there.         For more than 50 years she was married to Curville Jones Robinson, a mechanical engineer, who died in 1989.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  October 31, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Anna Johnstone Robinson, a theatrical designer, listed a stage credit for her in error. Lucinda Ballard, not Mrs. Robinson, was the costume designer for "A Streetcar Named Desire."       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.
