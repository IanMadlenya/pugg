         Peggy Appiah, who as a daughter of a British chancellor of the exchequer defied the conventions of her time by marrying an Ashanti political leader and who went on to become an author and a revered figure in her adopted homeland, Ghana, died Saturday in Kumasi, Ghana. She was 84.         The cause was a heart attack at Akomfo Anokye Hospital, according to her son, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.         Reared in upper-crust Britain, the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford Cripps, a Labor party leader and cabinet officer in the Clement Attlee government (1945-51), Peggy Cripps caused an international sensation when she announced plans to marry in July 1953. Her fianc√© was Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was in London as a law student and representative of Kwame Nkrumah, prime minister of the Gold Coast, the British colony that became Ghana in 1957.         Nkrumah was Ghana's first president, and Mr. Appiah was a close associate and his choice for vice president, until political differences led Nkrumah to imprison him several times.         The Appiahs are said to have been the inspiration, along with another African-British couple, Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, for the 1967 film ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' which dealt with a California couple's reaction to their daughter's engagement to a black doctor.         That view was lent support by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the department of African and African-American studies at Harvard, and a friend of Mr. Appiah's since their student days, who noted that it was a marriage of equals at the highest levels of their societies.         ''She was to the manner born and he was an aristocrat related to the king of the Ashanti,'' Mr. Gates said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''He was the John Adams of his country; its founding father with Kwame Nkrumah.''         The couple met at a gathering of the West African Students Union, of which Mr. Appiah was president. From the start, Miss Cripps made it clear that she would not be intimidated by the firestorm of criticism the couple endured.         ''If we experience any difficulties in mixing with Europeans, I shall throw in my lot with the colored people,'' she told The Sunday Express of London.         The marriage came to symbolize far more than the union of two individuals. Richard Weight, a British historian who is making a documentary about interracial marriage, said: ''For a lot of people, it drew the line between those who thought Britain had an integrated postcolonial future and those who didn't. And it became an international story with particular resonance because it involved the daughter of a former chancellor.''         Born in 1921, Enid Margaret Cripps, who used the name Peggy, was the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford and Lady Isobel Swithenbank Cripps. On her father's side she could trace her lineage back to William the Conqueror. She was reared at a rambling country house, Goodfellows, and spent much of World War II in Moscow, where her father served as ambassador. After the war, she went to Iran, where she worked for the British Army, which ran the railways.         She is survived by her son, the Laurance Rockefeller professor of philosophy at Princeton, who lives in Manhattan and Princeton, N.J., and three daughters, Isabel Endresen, an economist, of Windhoek, Namibia, Adwo Edun, a landscape gardener, of Lagos, Nigeria, and Abena Appiah of Kumasi; and eight grandchildren. Settling in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti people, shortly after her wedding, she shunned the traditional British -- and Ghanaian-- role of homemaker, even as she reared her children, served as helpmate to her husband, kept the family going when he was in prison and established several philanthropies.         ''At one time there was an effort to deport her,'' said Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker, who is Professor Appiah's companion. ''She said the airport was a long way away and she would kick and scream every inch of the way. Fearful of the publicity that would engender, they backed down.''         Known to many in Ghana as Auntie Peggy, Mrs. Appiah was a prolific writer of children's books, many of them based on the Ghanaian folk tales her husband told their children, as well as of novels, poetry and most recently a collection of 7,000 Ashanti proverbs, on which she collaborated with her son.         The book, published in English and Ashanti, had its origins in her collection of gold weights.         ''She collected weights used for weighing gold but made of brass,'' Professor Appiah said. ''Many of them had figurative art that came from proverbs. When a dealer came to the house, she would ask, 'What is the proverb?' and if he didn't know, she would eventually travel to the village to find out.''         Though she had a house in Brighton, England, Mrs. Appiah considered Ghana her home.         ''When my father died 15 years ago, people asked her, 'When are you going home?' '' her son said. ''She kept saying, 'I am home.' Finally she bought herself a plot of ground to be buried in, so when people said, 'When are you going home?,' she could answer: 'I am not going home. I have my burial plot here.' ''       
         Helen Hobbs Jordan, an exacting and tart-tongued music teacher who instructed generations of performers in ear training and theory, including Melissa Manchester, Bette Midler and Tony Bennett, died on Wednesday at her suite in the Salisbury Hotel, near Carnegie Hall. She was 99.         Mrs. Jordan left no immediate survivors, said Mary Jo Kaplan, a friend and former student, but her family was huge: a legion of devoted former pupils who tended to her needs.         One volunteered as her doctor, another as her accountant, another as her money manager. Others brought groceries and took her to dinner. Early last year, as Mrs. Jordan's money began running out, the group put on a benefit concert that raised more than $40,000, including large checks from Ms. Midler and Mr. Bennett.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Jordan taught sight singing, score reading and other fundamentals. But she also drummed in different sorts of lessons, like the importance of decorum, honesty and the pursuit of perfection.         ''I don't tolerate errors,'' an elegantly dressed Mrs. Jordan said in an interview with The New York Times in January 2005. ''If you have a brain, for God's sake, use it.''         Her students included the guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli and Gene Bertoncini; the singers Lesley Gore and Paul Simon; and the actor and director Carl Reiner. Future stars and those who were already stars came to her to polish the basics.         Melissa Manchester said she studied sight singing with Mrs. Jordan in the early 1970's.         ''I was just so impressed by her strength and character and her desire for excellence,'' Ms. Manchester said. ''That's what she wanted for her students. I was sort of sloppy around the edges regarding my musicianship. But she kept me humble and clear-sighted in terms of really not compromising.''         Mrs. Jordan carved out a niche among jingle singers, teaching them how to walk into a studio and immediately master a singing line, without rehearsal, during expensive recording sessions.         ''She taught the top,'' said Ms. Kaplan, a producer at Showtime.         For years Mrs. Jordan conducted classes at Steinway Hall in Manhattan. She self-published more than a dozen books laying out her method.         Helen Hobbs was born in Topeka, Kan., on April 6, 1907. Her father, Charles Hobbs, was later elected Kansas insurance commissioner, and her mother, Emma Swisher, taught piano. She received her undergraduate degree in music from Washburn University in Topeka.         In the 1930's she moved to New York City to continue a career as a violinist, attending the Juilliard School and Teachers College at Columbia. At one point she gave concerts on long train trips, and she toured Europe before World War II.         She grew frustrated with the violin and spontaneously gave it away to a cab driver whose instrument had been stolen. She went on to lead the general musicianship department of the American Theater Wing's professional school.         Mrs. Jordan was briefly married to Robert Jordan, a lawyer, before they divorced in the early 1950's. She had a long relationship with David Collyer, a Broadway singer and teacher, who died in 1996, and to the end kept a publicity photograph of him in her sitting room. She was godmother to his daughter, Ingrid Saxon, and they remained close.         ''She just didn't want to play second fiddle to anybody,'' Ms. Manchester said. ''She just wanted to star in her own life, and I think she did.''       
         Zelda Foster, a social worker and early leader of the hospice movement who wrote a seminal article in 1965 attacking what she called the ''conspiracy of silence'' facing dying patients in hospitals, died on July 4 at her home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, said Harold Foster, her husband of 41 years.         Mrs. Foster applied principals of hospice care to patients in her charge at a Veterans Administration hospital long before such practices became widespread. She was largely successful at spreading those ideas throughout the nation's hospitals, particularly in the V.A. hospital network.         Starting as a caseworker in the late 1950's, and eventually as a supervisor at hospitals in Brooklyn, Mrs. Foster pressed hospitals to address the psychological needs -- along with the medical ones -- of the terminally ill. She was unable to ignore her growing discomfort with the way dying patients were treated -- the lack of information from their doctors, the sense of separation from their families, their silent submission to their fate.         In her 1965 article, in the Journal of the National Association of Social Workers, she wrote of her experiences as supervisor of social work at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Brooklyn and of the hospital's efforts to reform its treatment of the terminally ill. For the first time, she wrote, ''the majority of patients were considered capable of understanding the nature of their diseases.''         ''The good patient was no longer one who silently submitted to his fate,'' Mrs. Foster wrote. ''Patients were able to view the doctor more realistically and had less of a need to invest him with magical, omnipotent powers.''         Dr. Susan Gerbino, a professor at the New York University School of Social Work, said: ''She was way ahead of her time. And that was long before anybody was talking about patient autonomy and informed consent.''         Zelda Phyllis Leader was born on Aug. 8, 1934, a daughter of Nathan and Ida Leader, the owners of a candy store in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. Besides her husband, Mrs. Foster is survived by a daughter, Rachel Kodsi, and a son, Joshua, both of Brooklyn; a sister, Jeanette Katz, of Queens; and three grandchildren.         Mrs. Foster graduated from Brooklyn College in 1955 and earned a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Social Work three years later. By then, she was already a caseworker at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. She started work at the Brooklyn V.A. hospital in 1959.         In May 1966, eight months after Mrs. Foster's article sent ripples through the social work field, an international conference on hospice care was held at the Yale University School of Nursing. The keynote speaker, Dr. Cicely Saunders, requested that Mrs. Foster be invited. From then on they were both considered leaders of the movement.         Dr. Saunders is credited with starting the hospice movement in England in the late 1940's. By the early 1960's, the patients' rights movement had taken a foothold in the United States.         Dr. Florence S. Wald, the dean of the Yale School of Nursing at the time, said Mrs. Foster was instrumental in persuading hospitals to adopt the principles of hospice care. ''She focused on the organization, from the top down,'' Dr. Wald said. ''Not only hospices, but hospitals must make room for family members to stay overnight, not just during visiting hours; that they be able to feed their dying family members; that the minister or the rabbi be part of the decision-making process.''         Mrs. Foster taught at the Columbia School of Social Work and was director of mental health for the Children's Aid Society. She was also the first president of the New York State Hospice Association. After working at the Brooklyn V.A. hospital from 1959 to 1971, she returned in 1979, serving as chief of social work until her retirement in 1998.         Dr. Gerbino, of N.Y.U., said Mrs. Foster also ''trained hundreds of social workers in leadership for end-of-life care.''         ''There are many mini-Zeldas that she inspired, myself included,'' Dr. Gerbino said.       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         The cause was complications of esophageal cancer, a family spokeswoman, Cathy Bonner, said. Ms. Bonner said the illness was diagnosed in March.         A champion of civil rights for minorities, women and gay men and lesbians, Ms. Richards first ran for governor in 1990 calling for a ''New Texas'' that would offer more opportunity and power to those groups.         She went on to become one of the most effective in a long line of Texas progressives who vied for control of the state when it was largely a Democratic stronghold. But her defeat after one term was a strong signal that generations of Democratic dominance in Texas had ended.         If one Mr. Bush closed out her political career, another figured into her rise, as a target of her barbs. ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her saucy, plain-spoken keynote address, borrowing from the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory, was one of the year's political highlights. ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said at one point.         The speech transformed her, then the Texas treasurer, into a national figure. And it made her, a mother of four, an admired champion of feminism. ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,'' she told the national audience. ''She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         Her defeat in 1994, coming in a year of sweeping Republican success at the polls nationwide, did not dim her celebrity on the national stage. She continued to speak out on behalf of liberal causes, was a regular commentator on CNN and appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips.         She also went to work as a senior adviser for the international law firm of Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper) and later for the public relations company Public Strategies. She also served on numerous boards of directors, including those of J. C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, an only child, in Lakeview, Tex. She graduated in 1950 from Waco High School, where she showed a special facility for debate and met her future husband, David Richards. In her junior year, she attended the Girls State mock government program in Austin and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girls Nation in Washington.         Ms. Richards went on to enroll at Baylor University in Waco on a debate scholarship and married. After graduating, she and Mr. Richards moved to Austin, where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School. She reared her four children -- Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen -- in Austin, and they were with her at home when she died, Ms. Bonner said.         Ms. Richards is also survived by eight grandchildren. Cecile Richards, who became president of Planned Parenthood this year, lives in New York; the other siblings live in Austin.         As a young woman, Ann Richards volunteered in several campaigns for governor: in 1958 for Henry B. Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough. She then helped Mr. Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In the early 1960's, she and a handful of other young Democrats founded North Dallas Democratic Women in an effort to give more power to women in the party. ''The regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who looked on women as little more than machine parts,'' she said later.         In 1972, she ran her first campaign, helping elect to the Texas Legislature Sarah Weddington, who had successfully argued Roe v. Wade before the United States Supreme Court.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin. She held the job for four years. She also began drinking heavily, becoming alcoholic and putting great strain on her marriage, she said later. The marriage ended in divorce.         After entering rehabilitation, she stopped drinking in 1980 and later said that the decision to seek help had saved her life and salvaged her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer and received the most votes of any statewide candidate, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years. She was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when Gov. William P. Clements Jr., the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, decided not to run for re-election, Ms. Richards challenged a former governor, Mark White, in the Democratic primary and won. She went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, in the general election after a brutal campaign.         As governor, among other achievements, she fulfilled her campaign promise to bring more blacks, Hispanics and women into public office. She appointed the first black regent to the University of Texas and installed the first blacks and women on the state's legendary police force, the Texas Rangers. She also pushed for tougher penalties for polluters and gained control of the state's insurance board in a drive to reduce the industry's influence over state government.         Ms. Richards oversaw an expansion of the state's prison system, increasing the space for prisoners by a third, and cracked down on the number of prisoners being paroled. She also instituted a major substance abuse program for prisoners and championed creation of the Texas lottery as a source of public school financing. She bought the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         The same year, she was named chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, which nominated Bill Clinton for president for the first time.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, George W. Bush, going so far as to refer to him as ''some jerk.'' The comment drew considerable criticism. She later acknowledged that Mr. Bush had been more effective than she at ''staying on message'' and that he had made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten 53 percent to 46 percent.         Ms. Richards was a co-author of several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' (Simon & Schuster, 1989), with Peter Knobler, and ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis'' (Dutton, 2003), with Richard U. Levine, a doctor.         On her 60th birthday, she got a motorcycle license, an event that was commemorated in a cover photo in Texas Monthly showing Ms. Richards's head superimposed on the body of a woman in a fringed jacket atop a Harley-Davidson beneath the headline ''White Hot Mama.''         In recent years, Ms. Richards had worked to establish the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, a public college preparatory school in Austin. It will open next year, giving priority to economically disadvantaged students. She was also a sought-after commentator and speaker whose observations had lost little of their tart humor since her national emergence two decades ago.         As she once explained, ''I learned early on that people liked you if you made them laugh.''         Correction:  September 16, 2006, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of Ann W. Richards, the former Texas governor, misstated the year she gave the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was 1988, not 1998.       
         Jane Hodgson, a prominent abortion rights advocate who in a highly publicized test case in 1970 became the only doctor in the United States to be convicted of illegally performing an abortion in a hospital, died on Oct. 23 at her home in Rochester, Minn. She was 91.         Dr. Hodgson's death was confirmed by her family.         Until January 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, abortion was illegal in most states. Among them was Minnesota, where Dr. Hodgson had a busy practice as an obstetrician and gynecologist.         In April 1970, Dr. Hodgson agreed to perform an abortion in order to challenge Minnesota law. At the time, abortion was permitted in the state only to save the woman's life.         The patient, a married mother of three, had contracted German measles early in her fourth pregnancy. Though the woman's life was not in danger, the disease carried a high risk for birth defects. Dr. Hodgson performed the abortion and was arrested shortly afterward. Convicted in November 1970, she was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a year's probation.         Dr. Hodgson's sentence was suspended pending appeal; after the Roe decision, her conviction was overturned. She served no jail time.         In later years, Dr. Hodgson remained a public champion of abortion rights, speaking widely on the subject and founding several reproductive health care clinics. She also lent her name to several abortion-related lawsuits, notably Hodgson v. Minnesota, which challenged a state law requiring both parents to be notified before a minor could have an abortion.         Ruling in the case in 1990, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Minnesota law with a 5-to-4 vote, finding it constitutional because of its provision allowing patients to seek permission from a judge instead of from their parents.         There was little in Dr. Hodgson's background that would mark her as a crusader. For the first decades of her career, she refused to perform abortions, though a steady stream of patients begged her to in whispers. But, as she said later in interviews, she grew increasingly troubled by watching women come to her with complications from botched abortions obtained elsewhere.         Jane Elizabeth Hodgson was born on Jan. 23, 1915, in Crookston, Minn. Her father was a country doctor, and she often accompanied him on rounds. She earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Carleton College in 1934 and an M.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1939. After advanced training at the Mayo Clinic, she established her practice in St. Paul.         In 1940, Dr. Hodgson married Frank Quattlebaum, a vascular surgeon; he died in 2004. She is survived by their two daughters, Gretchen Banks of Edina, Minn., and Nancy Burke of Golden Valley, Minn.; and three grandchildren.         When she was well into her 70's, Dr. Hodgson continued to make the 150-mile weekly trip from St. Paul to Duluth, Minn., to perform abortions at a clinic she had helped establish there.         ''I think in many ways I've been lucky to have been part of this,'' Dr. Hodgson said in the book ''Doctors of Conscience'' (Beacon Press, 1995) by Carole Joffe. ''If I hadn't gotten involved, I would have gone through life probably being perfectly satisfied to go to the medical society parties and it would have been very, very dull. I would have been bored silly.''
