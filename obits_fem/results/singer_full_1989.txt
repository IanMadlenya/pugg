        Beatrice Lillie, who during a half-century theatrical career was often called ''the funniest woman in the world,'' died yesterday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, England. She was 94 years old.         Beatrice Lillie, who during a half-century theatrical career was often called ''the funniest woman in the world,'' died yesterday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, England. She was 94 years old.         Miss Lillie, who used a long cigarette holder to punctuate the barbed ripostes for which she was famous, was the widow of Sir Robert Peel. But she never took her official title, Lady Peel, seriously and called her autobiography ''Every Other Inch a Lady.''         The Canadian-born comedienne suffered a series of strokes several years ago that silenced her voice and ended her career. Her last Broadway show was ''High Spirits,'' a 1964 musical version of Sir Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit,'' and her last film was the 1966 musical ''Thoroughly Modern Millie.''         The very name Beatrice Lillie could evoke memories of mirth and merriment for the hundreds of thousands of people she entertained in theaters, movie houses, vaudeville palaces and supper clubs and on radio and television, over a period of more than 50 years.         In Alexander Woollcott's estimation, Miss Lillie was ''a comic genius'' with her trademark close-cropped hair and fezlike cap. She was, in fact, one of those rare entertainers whose talents and qualities are extremely difficult to measure and describe. One had to see her to believe her - or perhaps disbelieve her. She was a great clown who learned early how to ''play'' an audience.         Because of that fact, it was often said that no two Lillie performances were ever the same. She explained that for most of her performances, when things went well, ''the wand was on; something happened between myself and the audience, for they recognized something I'd known for years - I was a natural-born fool.'' State of Havoc         Anyone who ever saw her sketch about a slightly tipsy, tongue-tied Mrs. Blagdon Blogg turning Harrods department store in London into a state of havoc, would consider her an adorably nutty fool. In the sketch, Mrs. Blogg tried, unsuccessfully, to buy ''two dozen double-damask dinner napkins,'' a request that soon started coming off her thickened tongue as ''two dazzle dimask dibble dimmer napples,'' and so forth.         In her sketches and songs, most of which were constructed to puncture the pompous, Miss Lillie could send her audiences into fits of laughter by merely lifting an eyebrow, twitching her nose as she spoke a certain phrase or turning her longish face into a rubbery U-shape with a somewhat equine smile. With great ease she seemed able to contort and mold that face into a thousand shapes.         Often it was not precisely what she said or sang that garnered so many laughs, but the way she delivered the material. As the critic George Jean Nathan put it, ''With one dart of her eyes, she can spare a skit writer a dozen lines.''         Sir Noel, Miss Lillie's devoted friend and often the writer of her material, her director or her co-star, finally grew accustomed to her idiosyncrasies. ''For an author-director to attempt to pin Beattie down to a meticulous delineation of character is a direct invitation to nervous collapse,'' he said. Natural Instinct for Humor         Miss Lillie had a natural instinct for humor. One spring day, while she was serving tea to friends in her East End Avenue apartment in New York, a pigeon flew in the window and sat on the arm of a chair. Some of Miss Lillie's guests were startled, but she merely looked at the bird and asked, ''Any messages?''         Beatrice Gladys Lillie was born in Toronto on May 29, 1894. Her father, John Lillie, a native of Northern Ireland, had served with the British Army in India before he married Lucie Shaw, an Englishwoman. Beatrice had an older sister, Muriel.         Mrs. Lillie, who enjoyed a modest reputation as a concert singer, had great expectations for her daughters - Muriel would be a concert pianist, Beatrice a soprano - and their musical training began early.         The Lillie Trio - Mrs. Lillie, Beatrice and Muriel - entertained at local soirees and did a bit of touring, but Beatrice was showing signs of being an undisciplined soprano. The trouble was that she had discovered early the pleasures of making people laugh while she sang. At 8 years of age, she was thrown out of a church choir for making funny gestures and flopping her fan about during serious moments, causing small boys to giggle uncontrollably. Top Hat and Tails         At 15, Miss Lillie ended what had been at best a mere pass at a formal education, and sailed for England, where her mother had taken Muriel to study music. Her first stage appearance, which ran a week, was as a male impersonator, a role she was to play off and on, in top hat and tails, for several years. ''I was the best-dressed transvestite in the world,'' Miss Lillie said.         In 1914, she was hired for a minor role in ''Not Likely,'' produced by Andre Charlot, a Frenchman who had brought to London, with great success, the concept of the little revue of fast-paced, sophisticated songs, skits and blackouts.         The young, bubbling Miss Lillie was besieged by hordes of stage-door Johnnies. The one who won her was the handsome Robert Peel, whose ancestor Sir Robert Peel served as one of Queen Victoria's Prime Ministers and organized London's Metropolitan police force. Its members were nicknamed ''bobbies'' after him. Wed at Family Estate         Miss Lillie was married to the future Sir Robert Peel at his family's estate, Drayton Manor, in 1920, but the bridegroom's parents stayed away, disapproving of ''theatrical folk.'' The couple's only child, also named Robert and called Little Bobbie, was born a year later.         A few months afterward, a bored Beatrice Lillie returned to the stage in Charlot's revue ''Now and Then.''         Miss Lillie's insistence on not giving up her career was dictated in part by economic necessity. Her husband was virtually penniless, a man who was never able to hold down a job and a gambler as well.         ''It was fortunate that I could trek back and forth across the Atlantic, earning a living for my son and husband,'' Miss Lillie said. The couple grew apart, and Sir Robert died of peritonitis at the age of 36, in 1934, in the home of his mistress. Son Killed in World War II         Miss Lillie's private world was shattered in 1942, when her son, who had enlisted in the Royal Navy, was killed in a Japanese air raid on the port of Colombo, Ceylon.         Miss Lillie spent much of the war entertaining troops in the Mediterranean region, Africa, the Middle East and, later, in Germany.         Over the years, she appeared in at least one revue a year, and sometimes two or three. Among them was ''This Year of Grace'' in 1928, written by and co-starring Sir Noel. One of Miss Lillie's most famous songs was ''Mad Dogs and Englishmen,'' introduced in her ''Third Little Show'' on Broadway in 1931. It became a standard in her repertory as well as in Sir Noel's.         In her 1972 autobiography, Miss Lillie told how another of her standards, ''There Are Fairies in the Bottom of My Garden,'' was introduced, against her will, into her repertory. Her friend Ethel Barrymore thought the song was a lovely, serious one, but Miss Lillie made it a side-splitter, especially when she sang it garbed in a long formal gown, then raised her skirt and roller-skated off stage. Radio Series in the 30's         Miss Lillie's Broadway and West End shows included ''Walk a Little Faster,'' ''The Show Is On,'' ''Happy Returns,'' even George Bernard Shaw's ''Too True to Be Good,'' one of her few straight plays, in which it was felt she was miscast. She made half a dozen movies and also had a radio series in the 1930's.         She toured the United States many times, in ''An Evening With Beatrice Lillie,'' ''Inside U.S.A.,'' and half a dozen other shows. Her friends were fond of telling the story about the time Miss Lillie and several chorus girls went to a beauty parlor in Chicago to have their hair done before an opening. An heiress to a meatpacking empire came in and informed the beauty salon's proprietor that she was ''mortified and infuriated to learn this establishment has been taken over by showgirls.''         As Miss Lillie left her booth, she loudly told the salon proprietor, in her most proper and meticulously enunciated English: ''You may tell the butcher's daughter that Lady Peel is finished.'' And she sailed out.         Beatrice Lillie was an original, but one who never took herself seriously. Once a reporter asked, ''Miss Lillie, what lies at the bottom of your art?''         ''There are fairies at the bottom of my art,'' she answered.         Miss Lillie left no immediate survivors.       
        Lina Prokofiev, a singer and the wife of the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, died Tuesday in London. She was 91 years old and lived in London.         Lina Prokofiev, a singer and the wife of the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, died Tuesday in London. She was 91 years old and lived in London.         Born in Madrid, Mrs. Prokofiev, whose original name was Carlina Codina, spent her childhood and went to high school in New York. A soprano, she made her debut in Milan as Gilda in Rigoletto, and took the stage name of Lina Llubera.         It was in New York where she first met Mr. Prokofiev, after one of his performances in Carnegie Hall in 1918.         They were married in 1923 and lived in Paris through the 1920's and 1930's.         In 1936, they moved to Moscow with their two sons, Oleg and Svyatoslav.         Their marriage began to deteriorate within a few years after their move, and in 1941, Mr. Prokofiev left his wife for Myra Mendelson, a young Soviet writer.         In ''Prokofiev,'' a biography published by Funk & Wagnalls, the author Victor Seroff said the separation and divorce was forced upon the composer by the Stalinist government.         She was placed under surveillance by the Stalinist authorities and sent to a Siberian labor camp in 1948 where she remained eight years. Mr. Prokofiev died in 1953.         Mrs. Prokofiev left the Soviet Union for Paris in 1974 and never returned.         She returned to New York in 1985 to narrate a performance of Mr. Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf'' at Alice Tully Hall.         She is survived by her two sons and eight grandchildren, all of London.       
        Bessie Griffin, a gospel singer, died of cancer yesterday at Brockton Memorial Center in Culver City, Calif. She was 67 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         Bessie Griffin, a gospel singer, died of cancer yesterday at Brockton Memorial Center in Culver City, Calif. She was 67 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         Miss Griffin was born in New Orleans, and grew up singing in church. She developed a powerful contralto style that was compared to that of Mahalia Jackson and Bessie Smith.         In New Orleans, Miss Griffin worked with the Southern Harps, a group that also included Linda Hopkins. She joined the Caravans, a leading Chicago gospel group, in 1953, and she founded the Gospel Pearls in Los Angeles in the late 1950's. That group was one of the first to perform in the secular world of nightclubs and television, appearing frequently in the early 1960's on programs like ''Hootenanny'' and the ''Ed Sullivan Show.'' Miss Griffin recorded by Columbia, Decca, Epic, Savoy and Specialty Records.         In recent years, Miss Griffin toured as a soloist, singing at jazz festivals as well as churches. Her last recording session took place in 1987. It is to be released along with vintage material on the album ''Even Me,'' on the Spirit Feel Records label.         Miss Griffin is survived by her husband, Spencer Jackson.       
        Tally Brown, an actress and a cabaret performer, died after a stroke on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Tally Brown, an actress and a cabaret performer, died after a stroke on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Ms. Brown was prominent in the underground performance world of the 1960's and 70's, appearing frequently at such New York nightclubs as Reno Sweeney's, S.N.A.F.U. and the Continental Baths, and acting in such experimental films as ''Brand X,'' ''The Illiac Passion'' and several early works by Andy Warhol.         A short, stout singer with wild black hair, Ms. Brown was known for her intense, dramatic renditions of songs by Kurt Weill, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. She also appeared in Broadway and Off Broadway productions of ''Mame,'' ''The Pajama Game,'' ''Medea'' and other works. In 1951, Ms. Brown was a founder of the Fine Arts Conservatory, in Miami, which was one of the first racially integrated theaters and art schools in the South. She was the subject of ''Tally Brown, New York,'' an award-winning 1980 documentary by Rosa von Praunheim.       
        Maggi Newhouse, a former radio and television talk show hostess who appeared under the name Maggi McNellis, died of heart failure yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         Maggi Newhouse, a former radio and television talk show hostess who appeared under the name Maggi McNellis, died of heart failure yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         She began her career as a supper club singer, appearing at the Pump Room in Chicago and the Rainbow Room in New York, among other spots.         She switched to radio in 1943 as the hostess of gossipy programs, ''The Maggi McNellis Show'' and ''Maggi's Private Wire.'' She also participated in the radio program ''Leave It to the Girls,'' which offered women advice on romance and marriage. Later she became the moderator of a television version of the show, remaining with it until it went off the air in 1954.         She also was hostess of the ''Maggi McNellis Show'' and ''Maggi's Magazine'' on television, again using her name from her first marriage to Richard V. McNellis. ''Leave It to the Girls'' was revived briefly in 1962, with Mrs. Newhouse as its hostess. Energetic Social Life         The wife of the late Clyde M. Newhouse, a member of the communications industry family and an art gallery owner, Mrs. Newhouse maintained an energetic social life as a moderator of charity fashion shows and chairwoman of balls. She was active in such causes as the Southampton Hospital, the Parrish Art Museum, Guideposts for Children, the Police Athletic League and United Cerebral Palsy of New York.         She was born in Chicago and attended Rosemont (Pa.) College.         Mr. Newhouse died in 1986. Surviving Mrs. Newhouse are her daughter, Meg Kirkpatrick, and a brother, George Roche, both of Manhattan, and a grandson. A memorial is to be held on June 1 at 4 P.M. in St. James' Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Avenue.         Correction:  May 26, 1989, Friday, Late City Final Edition         An obituary yesterday about Maggi McNellis Newhouse, former host of radio and television talk shows, misidentified her late husband, Clyde Newhouse. He was the president of a Manhattan art gallery; he was not a member of the Newhouse publishing family.       
        Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         It was generally acknowledged that Miss Milanov was the greatest dramatic soprano after Rosa Ponselle, who retired early in 1937. On Dec. 17, 1937, the young Yugoslav soprano made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Leonora in Verdi's ''Trovatore.'' It was not one of the more fabulous debuts in the Met's history, and critics hedged about the new singer.         But when Miss Milanov settled down after a few performances and demonstrated what she could do, it became clear that the great Ponselle had a worthy successor. In her first season at the Metropolitan Opera, Olin Downes, then the chief music critic of The New York Times, constantly referred to her ''magnificent'' voice and her ''grand manner.'' Virgil Thomson in The New York Herald Tribune wrote that she had a voice ''with a beauty unmatched among the sopranos of this country.''         Everything about Miss Milanov commanded respect, and that included her physical and vocal size.         When Edward Johnson, then general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard her in 1937 at the Salzburg Festival, where she was singing under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, he immediately recognized her potential and offered her a contract that had two stipulations: She had to learn her roles in Italian (up to then she had been singing Italian operas in her native Croatian or in German), and she had to take off 25 pounds. English, After a Fashion         She not only learned to sing in impeccable Italian, but she also learned English, after a fashion. For many years she would order a ''martinelli'' instead of a martini, an allusion to the musical associations with the tenor Giovanni Martinelli.         She was always struggling with her weight and often tried to diet. But she liked to eat, and was herself a good cook, specializing in Yugoslav dishes. Once she took off considerable weight and a critic wrote that the dieting had also brought with it ''a disturbing lessening of her powers.''         Miss Milanov shrugged off the comment. ''You try to do your best to please the public, please critics, please everybody,'' she said. ''Then you lose weight and they don't like you. What you do? You get bugs in the head.'' A Formidable Ego         Miss Milanov was a legend around the Metropolitan Opera in more ways than one. Her ego was commensurate with her stature as a vocalist.         ''I love applause,'' she once said to an interviewer. ''Money is not everything. Money is last.'' Rash was the singer who would try to upstage Miss Milanov at curtain calls.         Stories about her circulated in the house almost from the moment she first set foot on stage. Once, during a stage rehearsal, she looked into the auditorium and saw the team of backup singers for ''Il Trovatore.'' She advanced to the footlights. ''Listen, listen, listen - learn, learn, learn,'' she told the young singers. In a Mischievous Mood         It is said that she could drive her colleagues crazy during performances when she was in a mischievous mood. George London, as Amonasro in ''Aida,'' would be preparing for his big baritone solo. Miss Milanov at that moment would whisper in his ear, ''How's the baby, George?'' Or, in the ''Aida'' Nile scene with a tenor she did not particularly like: ''You're not in good voice tonight, are you? Do you think you can make that high B?''         She could be inconsistent in her singing. It was noticed time and again that Miss Milanov could sing like an angel in one act and have pitch troubles in another.         But there was never a time in any opera when she did not thrill her audiences, and she did so entirely through her voice, because she never was much of an actress. Definitely of the old operatic school of acting, she used the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions that went out in the early days of silent films. But she was a fine musician and never used her voice in an exaggerated manner.         Her singing was refined, subtle, powerful, sensitive or dramatic, as the music demanded. She produced a big, warm sound and had an equalized scale up to a secure high C. In the ''Aida'' Nile scene she was able to take a haunting pianissimo on the C that will forever float in memory. She was equally impressive in ''Il Trovatore,'' an opera that she ''owned.'' Fortunately, she recorded that opera with Jussi Bjoerling and Leonard Warren, and connoisseurs believe it is the greatest performance of that work ever put on disks. Born to a Musical Family         She was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 17, 1906, the daughter of a bandmaster named Rudolf Kunc. The family was musical, and her brother, Bozidar, became a pianist and composer who often was her accompanist for her recitals. She also had an uncle who composed songs for her early recitals. She started singing as a child and made her recital debut in Zagreb when she was 15 years old.         Milka Ternina, a great Wagnerian soprano at the turn of the century, heard the young soprano and took her as a pupil for three years. After graduating from the Royal Music Academy in Zagreb, where she won first prize in singing, Miss Kunc became a member of the State Opera, making her debut as Leonora in ''Il Trovatore.''         Soon she was singing in opera houses in Germany and Central Europe, and appearing with orchestras under conductors like Bruno Walter. Toscanini invited her to Salzburg in 1937 to sing the soprano solo in the Verdi Requiem. She was to sing it with him many times in the future.         She married a Yugoslav actor and director, Predrag Milanov, in 1937. He served as her dramatic coach for many years. Gave 445 Met Performances         At the Metropolitan Opera she specialized in Verdi roles, above all ''Aida,'' which she sang at the house and on tour with the Met 75 times. She also appeared in ''Il Trovatore'' 49 times, ''La Forza del Destino'' 37 times, ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' 30 times, ''Otello'' 17 times, ''Simon Boccanegra'' 10 times and ''Ernani'' 8 times. Her other roles were Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' which she sang 57 times, Ponchielli's Gioconda, Puccini's Tosca, Bellini's Norma (a role ventured by only three sopranos at the Met in the 60 years before Miss Milanov sang it), Mozart's Donna Anna and Maddalena in Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' the role she sang at her farewell. All told, she gave 445 performances with the company.         Miss Milanov became an American citizen in 1946. ''When you come to America,'' she said, ''you get independent like American women.'' At that time, she was getting a divorce from Mr. Milanov. In 1947, she married Gen. Ljubo Ilic of Yugoslavia. Though trained as an architect, he had served as a general with the Resistance in southern France.         At the time of his marriage, General Ilic, a close friend of Marshal Tito, was a diplomat. Miss Milanov left the Met from 1947 to 1951, returning to Yugoslavia with her husband. Accused of Being a Spy         In 1949 she was accused by the Soviet Union of being a United States spy. She said the charge was ''silly.'' Her manager, Jack Adams, laughed at the allegation. He said that Miss Milanov could never have been a spy because she could never keep a secret, and that she was interested only in music, clothes, good food and wine.         She was honored on her 25th anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera with an on-stage ceremony, with Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, as master of ceremonies. She decided to retire at the end of the 1965-66 season, just before the opening of the new opera house in Lincoln Center. ''It is better,'' she said, ''to go away on two legs rather than on one.''         In her last operatic performance, on April 14, 1966, she sang the role of Maddalena in ''Andrea Chenier.'' In a ceremony on stage after the third act, Mr. Bing presented her with a Steuben glass cup and Lowell Wadmond, the chairman of the Met's board, gave her a silver tray. Two days later, Miss Milanov made her final appearance in the house. During the festivities on April 16, the final day at the old Met, she sang a ''Chenier'' duet with Richard Tucker.         In her years of retirement, Miss Milanov kept up a lively interest in the affairs of the Metropolitan and devoted much of her time to coaching younger singers (among them Christa Ludwig, Regine Crespin and Anna Moffo). She divided each year between Manhattan and Yugoslavia. Her recent birthday was celebrated with a party for 20 close friends and relatives in her home, for which the soprano, as was her custom, did all the cooking.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         To a generation of children in the late 1940's and the 50's, Miss Allison was the girlfriend, mother and gentle conscience of the Kuklapolitan Players, the puppet troupe created by Burr Tillstrom. Thanks to Tillstrom and Miss Allison, who treated the puppets like people, their exploits and personalities made them family favorites on prime-time television for 10 years.         ''I adored Kukla and Ollie - they were never anything but real to me,'' Miss Allison said in an interview.  Joining the Kuklapolitans She was born in La Porte City, Iowa, and after graduating from Coe College became a teacher. Later, she auditioned as a singer on a local radio station. By 1937, she was a popular radio personality in Chicago.         In 1947, she joined the Kuklapolitan Players, and they made their television debut the following year. ''I needed a girl who could talk to a dragon,'' Tillstrom explained.         By 1950, the show had six million viewers. As Fran, Miss Allison seemed particularly fond of Ollie, an outrageous, single-toothed dragon who adored buttered popcorn and putting his hair in curlers. Kukla loved to lean on Ollie's head, messing his hair. Fran was the soothing character.         In those years, television was performed live and Miss Allison once admitted she never knew in advance exactly what the puppets would say. ''On the air, you say exactly the same thing you would say if it happened for the first time, off the air,'' she said in an interview. A Baritone Dragon         In the early 1950's, Miss Allison made her Town Hall debut, assisting Ollie, whose full name was Oliver J. Dragon, in his first Manhattan performance as a baritone.         ''It may be ironic,'' The New York Times observed in 1952, ''but Kukla and Ollie still seem so real that it's always a little disturbing when Burr Tillstrom steps into view.''         When the program went off the air, it left a group of sad adults and children. ''One of the most imaginative shows ever developed in the electronic medium,'' wrote the Times critic. The program reappeared briefly in the 1970's. Burr Tillstrom died in 1985 at the age of 68.         In the 1960's, Miss Allison was host of a show of films for children and appeared in musicals on television. In Los Angeles, she was host of a program for the elderly, ''Prime Time,'' on KHJ-TV.         Miss Allison is survived by her brother, Lynn, of Chicago.       
        Florence McDonald, an outspoken radical who was elected to two public offices in Berkeley, Calif., in the 1970's, died of cancer Thursday at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. She was 73 years old and lived in Berkeley.         Florence McDonald, an outspoken radical who was elected to two public offices in Berkeley, Calif., in the 1970's, died of cancer Thursday at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. She was 73 years old and lived in Berkeley.         Mrs. McDonald, an avowed Marxist, entered Berkeley politics when she moved there in 1967. She began with four-hour vigils each Sunday in front of City Hall in protest against the Vietnam War. In 1975 she was elected City Auditor and served four years; in 1979 she was elected to the City Council. In 1982 she ran unsucessfully for state controller as the Peace and Freedom Party candidate.         Mrs. McDonald was born in Washington, the child of Russian immigrants. Her mother was a Communist, her father a Zionist and anarchist. She joined the Young Communist League at the age of 12 and had been arrested more than two dozen times by the time she was 18.         She is survived by two sons,the rock singer Country Joe McDonald, of Berkeley, and Billy of Oakland; a daughter, Susan Amoroso of Bolinas, Calif.; a brother, Sidney Plotnick of Los Angeles, and 10 grandchildren.       
        Nancy Andrews, a stage actress and singer hailed for starring performances in ''Little Me'' opposite Sid Caesar and in ''Tobacco Road'' with John Carradine, died on Saturday of a heart attack at St. John's Hospital in Queens. Miss Andrews, who was 68 years old, had lived in Manhattan for decades, but was confined to a nursing home in         Nancy Andrews, a stage actress and singer hailed for starring performances in ''Little Me'' opposite Sid Caesar and in ''Tobacco Road'' with John Carradine, died on Saturday of a heart attack at St. John's Hospital in Queens. Miss Andrews, who was 68 years old, had lived in Manhattan for decades, but was confined to a nursing home in Queens for the last year.         She won a Theater World Award for her 1949 Broadway debut in a hit revue, ''Touch and Go,'' and had later popular successes in ''Hazel Flagg,'' ''Plain and Fancy,'' ''Pipe Dream'' and ''Juno.''         Appraising ''Touch and Go,'' by Jean and Walter Kerr, Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that ''Nancy Andrews is a versatile comedian who can contribute something out of her own bag of tricks to round out the humor of a song.         ''As an incidental ballad, 'Miss Platt Selects Mate,' may not be exactly uproarious, but it is by the time Miss Andrews gets through larding it up with some very funny mugging.'' Other Stage Roles         Off Broadway, her favorite roles included Mrs. Peachum in the long-running ''Three Penny Opera,'' Julie in Jerome Kern's ''Show Boat,'' Mother Grieg in ''Song of Norway,'' Aunt Eller in ''Oklahoma!'' Mrs. Mister in the award-winning revival of ''The Cradle Will Rock'' and the title role of a corrupt cosmetician in ''Madame Aphrodite.''         On tours, she had leading roles in such musicals as ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ''Funny Girl,'' ''Flower Drum Song,'' ''South Pacific'' and ''A Little Night Music.'' She also often starred in such straight plays as ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''A Taste of Honey.''

        Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Jan DeGaetani, an American mezzo-soprano who became a champion of avant-garde music, died of leukemia Friday night in Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 56 years old and a resident of Rochester.         Miss DeGaetani developed into one of the most respected singers and musicians on the international scene, and in the opinion of many critics, the finest song recitalist that the United States has ever produced. Her creamy voice was wide in range, perfectly placed and produced, always on pitch and handled with consummate artistry.         Miss DeGaetani, who sang everything but opera, had one of the largest repertories of any singer before the public. It ranged from Renaissance music to Cole Porter. It encompassed the world of German lieder and French chanson. She was as much at home with a Beethoven mass as with a Berlioz song cycle with orchestra. She sang Stephen Foster songs and Victorian ballads.         She was called the Queen of the Avant-Garde by some critics. She sang in many languages as though each were her native tongue. Her concert tours took her all over the world, and she sang with virtually every major orchestra and conductor in such works as Bach's B-minor Mass, Beethoven's Mass in C and Ravel's ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges.''         She was exceptionally well known as a specialist in contemporary music. Many composers, and many specialists, considered that to be the most important part of her work. Jobs as Secretary and Waitress         At the Juilliard School she developed an interest in contemporary music. Immediately after graduation, she joined the Gramercy Chamber Ensemble and the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. She took many jobs to keep going, including secretarial work, waiting on tables, baby-sitting and occasional television commercials.         The turning point in her musical life came after her graduation in 1955, when in addition to her other work she devoted an entire year to learning Arnold Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' a seminal work composed in 1912.         Studying ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' she once said, ''opened my mind to endless kinds of beauty, and music hasn't been the same to me since.'' She eagerly sought out other music of the avant-garde, and established a special relationship with many composers.         George Crumb wrote his ''Ancient Voices of Children'' for her. Jacob Druckman, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gyorgy Ligeti and Pierre Boulez all wrote music with her voice in mind, often dedicating the scores to her. She sang the world premieres of many of their compositions. Other composers with whom she was closely associated were Elliott Carter, William Schuman, Richard Wernick and Mario Davidovsky. Her interest in new music made her a hero to the avant-garde, and she soon became a cult figure.         From the beginning, Miss DeGaetani used the same accompanist, Gilbert Kalish, and an unusual rapport developed between them. Critics noted that they thought alike and breathed alike. Miss DeGaetani said their concerts were ''joint recitals, mutual in every respect.'' The Ultimate Gift         She had, in addition to her other natural attributes, the ultimate gift of the song recitalist - the ability to make every member of the audience feel as though she was singing for that person and that person alone.         Donal Henahan of The New York Times wrote after a 1981 concert that Miss DeGaetani had the ability ''to do with apparent ease what most singers find impossible to do at all, which is to sing straight into the listening heart and mind.''         Despite the wide-ranging variety in her programs and the musical difficulties that many posed, she was anything but a dry or intellectual singer. She believed, as she told an interviewer a few years ago, that intuition was at the very least as important as intellect. ''You must use your most opulent, raw, gut intuition,'' she said. ''You don't take that out of yourself when you use your intellect.''         Miss DeGaetani was born in Massillon, Ohio, on July 10, 1933, sang in the church choir there and later said she knew then that she was going to be a singer. Her father, Earl D. Reutz, a lawyer, encouraged his talented daughter, whose given name was Janice. After her marriage to the conductor Thomas DeGaetani, she sang under the name Jan DeGaetani. Taught at Eastman and Aspen         For many years Miss DeGaetani taught at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and at the summer festival in Aspen, Colo. Among her pupils were Lucy Shelton, William Sharp, Amy Kaiser and Milagro Vargas.         Miss DeGaetani made more than 35 recordings. They were typical of her repertory, ranging from Renaissance music to music of the current decade. Among her most famous disks are Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' music by Ravel, George Crumb's ''Ancient Voices of Children,'' a Stephen Foster disk and a recent one named ''Songs of America,'' which received rave reviews.         She made her last record last March while fatally ill. The recording contains 10 Mahler songs and the Berlioz ''Nuits d'Ete.'' It will be released in the fall by Bridge Records.         Her marriage to Mr. DeGaetani ended in divorce in 1966. In 1969 she married the oboist Philip West, also a teacher at Eastman. Mr. West has participated in many of his wife's recitals.         Surviving are her husband; the two children of her first marriage, Mark West of Rochester and Francesca Watson of the Philippines ; her mother, Eleanor Ruetz of Portland, Ore., and a sister, Vera McKenna of Portland.         There will be a private service and a memorial this week at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester.

        Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Norma Terris, who was catapulted to stardom as a lead in the original production of ''Show Boat,'' died Wednesday after a brief illness at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She was 87 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Miss Terris played Magnolia in the Florenz Ziegfeld production of the hit musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Opening in 1927, the show ran on Broadway for two and a half years with Miss Terris, who was critically acclaimed for her lovely voice and charming acting.         While she was rehearsing for ''Show Boat,'' Kern and Hammerstein wrote a song for her, ''Why Do I Love You?'' one of the musical's enduring songs. She repeated her success in a 1932 revival on Broadway.         While she went on to other roles in the musical theater, Miss Terris remained linked to her most glittering triumph and never surpassed it. For 10 years in the 1930's and 1940's, she was a star of the Municipal Opera Company of St. Louis, appearing in plays by Noel Coward and Moss Hart. She also acted in Hollywood films in the 1930's. Role as a Patron         By the end of the 1940's, she moved gracefully into the role of patron of the musical theater. A 30-year member of the board of the Goodspeed Opera House Foundation, in Chester, Conn., Miss Terris sang there occasionally and supported the theater.         In 1984, the Goodspeed opened the Norma Terris Theater in her honor, dedicated to developing new musicals. Miss Terris performed a one-woman show of impersonations of great musical-comedy stars, donating the proceeds to the center. Later, she established a fund to encourage performing artists and composers and endowed an intern program at the Goodspeed Opera House, which aids young people starting theatrical careers.         Miss Terris, a devoted animal lover, donated 30 acres of land in East Haddam, Conn., as a nature center and regional office for the Humane Society.         She was born in Columbus, Kan., to a singer, who named her after the Bellini opera ''Norma.'' She got her first show business break in the title role of George M. Cohan's ''Little Nellie Kelly.''         She is survived by her husband, Albert D. Firestone.       
        Rose (Chee Chee) Murphy, a jazz pianist and singer whose birdlike high-pitched voice brought her fame, died on Thursday in St. John's Hospital in Queens. She was 76 years old and lived in St. Albans, Queens.         Rose (Chee Chee) Murphy, a jazz pianist and singer whose birdlike high-pitched voice brought her fame, died on Thursday in St. John's Hospital in Queens. She was 76 years old and lived in St. Albans, Queens.         When Miss Murphy sang her pop tunes and jazz classics in the 1940's and 50's she spiced them with twitterings, chirrups and occasionally the sound ''chee chee,'' with which she became identified and which provided her nickname. She was known for her highly personalized rendition of ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love.''         In the 1960's she performed regularly at the Cookery in Greenwich Village.         There are no survivors.       
        Stella Gibbons, who won fame with her first novel, ''Cold Comfort Farm,'' died Tuesday at her home in north London. She was 87 years old.  Miss Gibbons, who was a journalist before she turned to books, wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and poems, but none rivaled her most celebrated story, which parodied an earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the century.         Stella Gibbons, who won fame with her first novel, ''Cold Comfort Farm,'' died Tuesday at her home in north London. She was 87 years old.  Miss Gibbons, who was a journalist before she turned to books, wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and poems, but none rivaled her most celebrated story, which parodied an earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the century.         ''Cold Comfort Farm,'' published in 1932, tells how the sophisticated Flora Poste visits her rural relatives, the weird Starkadder family, and reclaims them from gloom, doom and feuding.         In guidebook manner, the novelist inserted asterisks to mark passages characteristic of the authors she parodied, including Sheila Kaye-Smith, Mary Webb and D. H. Lawrence.         Miss Gibbons's 1933 poem ''The Marriage of Machines'' prophesied world pollution and destruction of wildlife. Her fiction included ''Miss Linsey and Pa,'' ''Roaring Tower and Other Short Stories,'' ''My American'' and ''The Bachelor.''         Miss Gibbons's second husband, the actor and singer Allan Webb, died in 1959.
