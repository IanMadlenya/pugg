         Peggy Durdin, a foreign correspondent and writer who in the course of four decades covered almost every country in Asia, died on Feb. 12 in Encinitas, Calif. She was 92.         Ms. Durdin, who began writing in 1938 after marrying Tillman Durdin, a longtime foreign correspondent for The New York Times, almost immediately delved into areas that at the time were rarely covered by women.         Her articles in the early 1950's included profiles of Ramon Magsaysay, the president of the Philippines who was emerging as a new Asian leader, and Ho Chi Minh, who even then was a household word to millions of Vietnamese. She also wrote a detailed survey of Singapore, described as a ''bizarre, booming anachronism.''         In the 60's and early 70's, her dispatches had datelines that included Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, Thailand and Tonga.         Early in her career, she was based in New Delhi as the India-Burma correspondent for Time magazine. She later contributed freelance articles to The New York Times Magazine, Life, Look, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and The Saturday Review. She also wrote many book reviews, primarily on books about Asia, for The Times.         Margaret Armstrong, known all her life as Peggy, was born in China, where her parents, Oscar V. and Lena Stutzman Armstrong, were Presbyterian missionaries. Her parents and their missionary friends took over her early education, and she went on to the Shanghai American School. She went to Agnes Scott College in Atlanta, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After graduation, she returned to the American School in Shanghai as head of the English department and remained there until her wedding, which was in Shanghai, then occupied by the Japanese. The couple moved to the Chinese wartime capital, Chungking, where their first house was bombed. When Mr. Durdin was covering Guadalcanal and New Guinea, Ms. Durdin was removed to Australia and worked in American Red Cross hostels there and in New Zealand. From 1943 to 1945, she was a political adviser to Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell.         She returned to China for three years, from 1945 to 1948. Moving to Hong Kong, she became active in China watching, as reporting on the closed Communist country from afar was known. In 1958, she was co-editor of The Atlantic magazine's special edition on Communist China and wrote a booklet on China for the Foreign Policy Association.         The Durdins spent time in Honolulu before returning to the mainland United States in the 70's. They were longtime residents of San Diego. Mr. Durdin died in 1998.         Ms. Durdin is survived by her brother, Oscar V. Armstrong of Mitchellville, Md., and Edward Chen of Hong Kong, whom the Durdins informally adopted.         Seymour Topping, a former Southeast Asia correspondent of The Times, said Ms. Durdin, with her language skills and experience, was a mentor to younger journalists like him and Theodore White.         Mr. Topping, later the foreign editor and the managing editor of The Times and now the administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and a professor of international journalism at Columbia University, noted in his 1972 book ''Journey Between Two Chinas'' that Ms. Durdin spoke colloquial Chinese and that she was especially unhappy when she later returned to China that the ordinary Chinese had grown afraid to talk to her.       
         María Félix, the Mexican film star whose extraordinary beauty and force of personality made her a living myth to Mexicans and a symbol of glamour and sophistication to fans throughout the world, died yesterday at her home in Mexico City. She was 87.         Ms. Félix made 47 films during a tumultuous film career that began with overnight stardom in the early 1940's and raged on for three decades. During the entire period, she reigned as the supreme goddess of Spanish-language cinema.         Ms. Félix made films in Mexico, Spain, Italy, France and Argentina, portraying figures like a belly dancer, a brothel keeper, a teacher, a soldier, a cabaret singer and a man-eating Roman empress. She was cast so often as a notorious or strong-minded woman that those characteristics became indistinguishable from her own tempestuous personality in the minds of many fans, especially after the success of early films with titles like ''Woman Without a Soul.''         She did not speak English and never accepted work in Hollywood, where directors offered her only stereotyped parts as a Latin spitfire.         She married four times, divorcing her first husband, a cosmetics salesman, and her second, Agustín Lara, who was Mexico's greatest songwriter. She was widowed by her third husband, Jorge Negrete, the country's leading male star, and by her last, Alex Berger, a French financier.         ''Many feminine images have ignited the fantasy of the Mexicans,'' wrote Octavio Paz, Mexico's Nobel Prize-winning poet, in a 1992 essay on cinema and myth-making. Some, he said, like the Virgen de Guadalupe, are sweet, maternal figures, and others, like the Malinche, Cortés's indigenous concubine, are inscrutable.         ''But the myth of María Félix is different,'' Mr. Paz declared. ''María Félix is a woman -- such a woman -- with the audacity to defy the ideas machos have constructed of what a woman should be. She's free like the wind, she disperses the clouds, or illuminates them with the lightning flash of her gaze.''         Ms. Félix's best movies were filmed in the 1940's, when she was a dominant figure in the golden age of Mexican cinema. She became so powerful that she exerted great influence over lighting, camera angles, scenario, wardrobe and other aspects of films usually reserved for producers and directors. In Europe and in Mexico during the 1950's, she worked with eminent European directors like Jean Renoir and Luis Buñuel and leading men like Gérard Philipe and Yves Montand.         Ms. Félix was born María de los Ángeles Félix Guereña, on May 4, 1914, in Álamos, Sonora, according to the birth certificate discovered by Paco Ignacio Taibo, the author of ''La Doña,'' a 1985 biography of Ms. Félix (Mexico City: Planeta).         Her father, Bernardo Félix, was a merchant turned civil servant and an imperious dictator over his middle-class household. Ms. Félix described him in 1993 interviews with Enrique Krauze, the Mexican historian, as a classic macho who hid his emotions, beat his sons and ignored his daughters. Her mother, Josefina Guereña, bore 16 children, of which 12 survived. María was the ninth.         When Ms. Félix was about 10, her family moved to Guadalajara, where she was expelled from several schools. But she made it to the university, where she was elected Queen of the Carnival. Enrique Álvarez, a traveling salesman proposed to her after demonstrating his Max Factor cosmetics to her, and she agreed to marry him. Her only son, Enrique Álvarez Félix, was born in 1934 when she was not quite 20. He died in 1996.         Her husband was jealous and rough. Ms. Félix became unhappy, and after a brief affair with a college student, obtained a divorce.         After she moved to Mexico City, a minor film director, Fernando Palacios, saw her on the street, persuaded her to consider acting, and helped her obtain her first part, in the 1942 film ''El Peñón de las Ánimas,'' or ''The Rock of the Spirits,'' a rural melodrama modeled loosely on ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Critics have lampooned the movie over the years for its histrionics; in its climactic scene, Ms. Félix is shot and hurled from the top of a tall pine. But the part immediately thrust Ms. Félix to the summit of Mexican cinema.         ''This was the appearance of a personality who had nothing to do with the rest of Mexican cinema,'' Mr. Taibo wrote in his biography. ''María was not only a singular beauty. She had a lofty bearing that stood in complete contrast to the traditionally submissive Mexican actress.''         In the years that remained in the decade, Ms. Félix filmed 19 movies that include her classic portrayals.         ''Enamorada,'' filmed in 1946, was the first of several in which she was teamed with the director Emilio Fernández and the cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, and which critics have judged her best work. In the film, a romantic comedy, Ms. Félix played the daughter of a wealthy patriarch in a Mexican town seized by revolutionary troops. The occupying general, who falls in love with her, was played by Pedro Armendáriz, a dashing Mexican star.         Ms. Félix never studied acting in any formal sense, but improvised her own approach to movie parts and to the cameraman's lens. ''She was never interested in a realistic style of acting,'' said Manuel Puig, the Argentine author, in 1990. ''Instead, she worked out a highly personal way of moving and talking.''         Adding to Ms. Félix's mythic stature was a romantic life that brought marriage or liaison with many leading men of her era and courtship by numerous powerful but eventually disappointed pretenders.         In 1943 she married Mr. Lara, Mexico's national musician-poet, a sensational union that drove newspapers wild, especially after Mr. Lara wrote Ms. Félix a song, ''María Bonita,'' or ''Pretty Maria,'' which became fabulously popular. The marriage was to Mexicans what Marilyn Monroe's marriage to Joe DiMaggio was to Americans.         But the marriage began to chafe under Mr. Lara's jealous eye. They divorced in 1947, and she traveled to Spain to film her first European movie, ''Mare Nostrum,'' in which she played a Latin Mata Hari.         Mr. Lara was only one of dozens of eminent men who fell in love with Ms. Félix, some ridiculously.         The artist Diego Rivera became so obsessed that he dedicated an entire period to painting her portraits. One, in which he dressed her in a sheer white gown revealing her silky figure, he titled ''Very Bad.'' A photo of the two at the time shows him, fat and froglike, embracing her as she, looking cool and gorgeous, stares away in bemused boredom.         ''He threw himself on me like misery throws itself on the poor,'' Ms. Félix recalled later.         Ms. Félix first met Mr. Negrete, who would be her third husband, filming ''The Rock of the Spirits.'' Their 1952 wedding was a national event, but the marriage was shortlived. Mr. Negrete's health was failing, and Ms. Félix, called again to film in Europe, left him behind. When word came that Mr. Negrete was stricken in Hollywood, she flew 36 hours west to his bedside, and accompanied his coffin back to Mexico City, where a line of mourners 10 miles long were waiting.         Starting in 1948 Ms. Félix began a love affair with Europe, filming six straight films in Spain, France and Italy, and a seventh in Argentina.         Blocked from a Hollywood career by her inability to speak English, Ms. Félix was determined to make movies in France. She devoted eight hours a day to studying French, putting a pencil under her tongue to practice her pronunciation.         Her French movies included ''La Belle Otero,'' directed by Richard Pottier in 1954, in which she played a turn-of-the-century courtesan, and ''French Cancan,'' directed by Jean Renoir later that same year.         Her last movie, ''La Generala,'' in which she played the sister of a rebel general who takes up arms when she sees the revolution betrayed, was released in 1970.         One of Ms. Félix's longest and most disagreeable conflicts involved Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican writer, who modeled the main character of a 1967 novel, ''Zona Sagrada'', on Ms. Félix, portraying her as a pathetic egomaniac. Fifteen years later, Mr. Fuentes again publicly dissected Ms. Félix's personality, along with that of another major Mexican actress, Dolores del Rio, in a play, ''Orchids in the Moonlight.''         Ms. Félix was bitter. ''Not only did he steal my soul in his novel, but he also attacked me and Dolores del Rio in his play,'' she told an interviewer from Vanity Fair magazine in 1990.         ''María has a mythic quality, and she's a great national symbol,'' Mr. Fuentes responded. ''That's why I could dare to have a character impersonate her: only a myth can inspire imitation.''         Yesterday, in learning of her death, Mr. Fuentes said: ''She was a goddess. There were no eyes in the world more beautiful than María Félix's. She was a magnificent character, and, along with Dolores del Rio, the greatest beauty of the golden age of the Mexican cinema.''       
         Barbara Anne Castle, a onetime Labor cabinet minister and determined socialist whose radical, ill-timed attempt to tame Britain's mighty trade unions doomed her political career, died yesterday. She was 91.         She died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Buckinghamshire, her family said in a statement. In a tribute, Prime Minister Tony Blair described her as a ''radical independent spirit.''         Baroness Castle of Blackburn, as she became in 1990, served in Harold Wilson's first two Labor cabinets, from 1964 to 1970, and in his third, from 1974 to 1976. After Mr. Wilson's surprise resignation in 1976, she might well have become party leader and the first woman to serve as prime minister. But the unions, aroused by her efforts to curb their power, cut short her rise.         In 1969, as secretary of state for employment and productivity and with the prime minister's enthusiastic support, Ms. Castle had published a plan called ''In Place of Strife,'' which sought to inject some discipline into Britain's chaotic industrial relations by making trade unions subject to legal sanctions.         The proposal proved popular with the public at large but split the Labor cabinet and provoked so furious a backlash from the unions, on whom the party relied for votes and money, that it had to be withdrawn.         The home secretary, James Callaghan, had led the opposition to her plan within the cabinet, and when he succeeded Mr. Wilson as prime minister in 1976 his first act was to dismiss her. He told her she was too old for ministerial office.         Three years later, despite a lifetime's opposition to British membership of the European Common Market, as it was then called, Ms. Castle left the House of Commons and embarked on a second political career as a member of the European Parliament, where she spent the next 10 years fighting European federalism but supporting efforts to establish Europe-wide social standards.         Considered one of the most left-wing members of Mr. Wilson's three cabinets, Ms. Castle was an intensely ideological politician, a stranger to compromise and pragmatism whose misfortune was to serve at a time when Britain's perilous economic condition required both skills.         As Britain's first minister of overseas development, she pulled together a disparate array of aid programs run by different departments and subjected them all to a single test: the promotion of development in backward countries.         In 1965 she took over the transport ministry, where she confronted the railway unions with a recommendation to close 2,000 stations and 3,000 miles of track -- a task proposed by the preceding Conservative government.         She also introduced breathalyzer testing in a crackdown on drunken driving that cut road deaths by 1,200 in the first year and ordered safety belts fitted to new cars.         As secretary for employment and productivity, she legislated equal pay for men and women. And after a spell in opposition, she overhauled Britain's social security system as secretary for social services, linking state pensions to average earnings and introducing new child allowances paid directly to the mother rather than through a husband's pay check.         But she always served in governments buffeted by industrial unrest and unending currency crises, which forced them into deflationary policies she could never accept. She also served under party leaders anxious to maintain good relations with Washington during the Vietnam War, which she strongly opposed. She differed with the leaders also over their resolve to retain Britain's nuclear deterrent, which she wanted to abandon, and their determination to keep Britain in the European Common Market, which she had never wished to join.         Barbara Anne Betts was born on Oct. 10, 1910, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the daughter of a socialist tax inspector who taught himself ancient Greek and a strongly socialist mother, both of Quaker background.         From Bradford Girls Grammar School she won a scholarship to St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where, excluded from the student debating society, known as the Union, because it did not admit women, she threw herself into Labor Party politics to the neglect of everything else, graduating with a disappointing third-class degree.         After Oxford she entered local politics in London and helped found a left-wing weekly, Tribune, which was edited by her lover, William Mellor, who died before they could marry. Soon afterward she met Ted Castle, a political journalist, and married him in 1944. He died in 1979. They had no children.         She was sent to Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire in 1945 as part of the postwar Labor landslide. The election brought Clement Attlee to power and led to the creation of the National Health Service and the nationalization of large swaths of British industry.         Ms. Castle's personal popularity with the party's rank and file was confirmed in 1950 when she was elected to its national executive committee, a post she held until 1979. But in her autobiography she acknowledged that the split between the party's extreme left wing (led by the Welsh firebrand Aneurin Bevan) and Labor's leadership ''helped keep the party out of office for 13 years.''         In 1952, Mr. Bevan published a personal political testament called ''In Place of Fear'' that greatly influenced Ms. Castle's thinking and largely explains how a self-proclaimed leftist like herself could set out to discipline Britain's powerful unions.         She borrowed shamelessly from its title when she called her reform blueprint ''In Place of Strife,'' thus seeking to place it in the middle of radical Labor Party thinking. What inspired those reforms, she wrote in her autobiography, was Bevan's plea for politicians to be more flexible and his belief that their ''Holy Grail'' should be ''the living truth, knowing that the truth being alive must change.''         This lead Ms. Castle to conclude, as she put it, that ''the trade unions, being an expression of the living truth, must learn to change their role'' and become more responsive to the needs of society as a whole.         Although ''In Place of Strife'' was stillborn, the task she had set herself would be accomplished a decade later by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, in every way her antithesis and a woman she disliked.       
         Phyllis Pray Bober, a scholar of Renaissance art and its relationship to classical antiquity, and a pioneering scholar in culinary history, died on May 30 at her home in Ardmore, Pa. She was 81.         Ms. Bober, a professor emerita of the humanities at Bryn Mawr, was known for her unusually wide range of interests, among them Roman provincial sculpture, Renaissance architectural theory, the history of collecting and antiquarianism, and the story of culture and cuisine.         Trained in archaeology at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, she was chosen as a young scholar to organize a monumental project, ''The Census of Classical Works Known to the Renaissance,'' which remained her focus for more than 40 years. The census grew into the standard resource for the subject, and Ms. Bober considered it her most significant work.         She often lectured, however, on historical cooking, which she said offered lessons for the modern world regarding ''conservation of energy, nurture of our environment and elimination of food wastage.''         Ms. Bober was known for her lavish banquets that recreated past cuisines. For a class at Bryn Mawr, she prepared a Roman feast that included an entire wild boar roasted in a college oven. At Oxford University in 1992, she lectured on the culinary uses of marijuana during the Italian Renaissance.         Her 1999 book, ''Art, Culture and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy'' (University of Chicago), explored connections between food and art from prehistory through the late Gothic period. She was working on a second volume, covering the Renaissance through the early 20th century, when she died. She also published ''Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture: A Handbook of Sources'' in 1986.         Ms. Bober founded the department of fine arts at the old Heights campus of New York University in the Bronx and served as its chairwoman from 1967 to 1973. In 1973 she became the dean of the Bryn Mawr College Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where she held appointments in two departments, art history and classical and Near Eastern archaeology.         She served as president of the College Art Association from 1988 to 1990; was elected to the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome in 1995 and to the American Philosophical Society in 1999 and, because of her work in culinary history, to the Dames d'Escoffier in 1995.         She was married to the art historian Harry Bober; they divorced in 1973, and he died in 1988.         She is survived by her companion, Ted Barnett, of Philadelphia, and by two sons, Jonathan Bober, a curator at the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas in Austin, and David Bober of New York.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Representative Patsy T. Mink, a liberal Democrat from Hawaii who was likely to be elected to a 13th term in November, died Saturday at the Straub Clinic and Hospital in Honolulu. She was 74.         The cause was viral pneumonia brought on by chickenpox, said Andy Winer, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Hawaii.         As a member of Congress from 1965 until 1977, and again from 1990 until her death, Ms. Mink was a champion of women's rights, education, civil rights and labor unions.         One of her primary legislative achievements came in 1972, when she was one of the sponsors of Title IX of the federal Education Amendments, which mandates equal financing for women's athletics and academics at institutions receiving federal money.         ''It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition,'' Ms. Mink said in 1995, in a meeting with some of the nation's top female basketball players.         Ms. Mink was known as articulate and strong-willed, and willing to fight for causes large and small.         In 1967, she and two other congresswomen tried to get into the House gym, after hearing about a form letter inviting members to use what was at the time an exclusively male preserve. They were turned away by the gym's director, who news reports said was ''horrified'' by their transgression.         Several years later, she took on Dr. Edgar F. Berman, a member of the Democratic Party's committee on national priorities, who claimed that women's ''raging hormonal imbalance'' made them unfit for executive positions in business and politics. Dr. Berman eventually resigned from the committee.         Ms. Mink, however, stopped short of associating herself with the women's liberation movement.         ''Just because I'm interested in women doesn't mean I'm for women's liberation,'' she told The New York Times in 1970. ''I support all groups when what they do coincides with what I believe in.''         Patsy Takemoto was born in Paia, a sugar plantation town on the island of Maui, on Dec. 6, 1927. As a senior at Maui High School she was elected student body president, and by the time she graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1948, her interests had shifted from medicine to the humanities.         In 1951, she graduated from the University of Chicago Law School. That same year, she married John F. Mink, a doctoral student in geology. The couple moved to Honolulu, where Ms. Mink opened a law office and became the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii, Mr. Winer said.         In 1956, Ms. Mink was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. In 1958, she was elected to the Hawaii Senate.         In her first period in Congress, Ms. Mink was an early critic of the Vietnam War, prompting some opponents to call her Patsy Pink.         In 1972 she and Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York traveled to Paris, where they met with North Vietnamese officials to discuss the prospects for peace.         In 1967, in a speech before the House of Representatives, Ms. Mink argued against harsh punishments for people who burned the American flag.         ''America is not a country which needs to punish its dissenters to preserve its honor,'' she said. ''America is not a country which needs to demand conformity of all its people, for its strength lies in all our diversities converging in one common belief, that of the importance of freedom as the essence of our country.''         In 1976, after 12 years in Congress, Ms. Mink sought a seat in the United States Senate. She lost the Democratic primary to Spark M. Matsunaga. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed her assistant secretary of state for oceans and international, environmental and scientific affairs.         Ms. Mink returned to Congress in 1990 after winning a special election for the seat vacated by Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, who was appointed to the Senate after Mr. Matsunaga's death. She discovered that many of her fellow Democrats had shifted toward more centrist positions.         ''She saw it as an opportunity to teach lessons,'' said Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii. ''She never thought for a moment of not working with people who didn't agree with her ideologically.''         In her final term, Ms. Mink raised questions about the creation of the Homeland Security Department, saying she feared that the new legislation could be used to undermine civil rights.         ''She had already been through that as a Japanese-American, seeing people put into detention camps on the basis of what they supposedly were as opposed to what they had actually done,'' Mr. Abercrombie said.         Ms. Mink is survived by her husband; their daughter, Gwendolyn; and a brother, Eugene Takemoto.       
         Alina Pienkowska, a shy and soft-spoken nurse whose impassioned words turned a shipyard strike in Gdansk, Poland, in 1980 into a nationwide and triumphant movement called Solidarity that ultimately helped to bring down Communism, died on Oct. 17 in Gdansk. She was 50. The cause was cancer, friends said.         Ms. Pienkowska spent much of her life in and around the giant shipyard on the Baltic shore. Her father worked there and had joined in protests in 1970 that led to army shootings in which dozens of workers were killed. A decade later, the young woman, widowed and with a young child, was working as a nurse at the yard.         By then she had become involved with a very small circle of activists who distributed a clandestine journal called The Coastal Worker, organized by Bogdan Borusiewicz, a passionate proponent of independent labor unions who was later to become Ms. Pienkowska's husband. Mr. Borusiewicz is currently a candidate for mayor of Gdansk.         In August 1980, Ms. Pienkowska was a withdrawn, single mother with prematurely gray hair who contributed articles to The Coastal Worker on health-related subjects like the rising rate of industrial accidents. That month, Anna Walentynowicz, a decorated crane operator at the shipyard and another member of Mr. Borusiewicz's circle, was fired. On Aug. 14, leaflets protesting her dismissal were distributed, and a dismissed welder named Lech Walesa, also in the group, climbed into the shipyard and proclaimed a strike.         From the windows of her apartment, Ms. Pienkowska saw that a strike had begun. Rightly assuming that state security agencies would have cut phone lines from the yard in the hope of keeping the strike secret from the nation and the world, she called friends in Warsaw, who alerted Western reporters, making sure the news would spread through Poland over Radio Free Europe.         But her greater contribution came two days later when she was with her fellow strikers in the shipyard. By then, many smaller factories and government establishments in the region had been struck, with their workers composing lists of demands. On Aug. 16, the shipyard management offered strikers there a considerable raise. The strike committee agreed, and Mr. Walesa announced that the strike had ended. Thousands of jubilant workers headed for the gates and home.         Ms. Pienkowska was enraged, realizing that as a result of the agreement tens of thousands of strikers at plants throughout the region were being left in the lurch. She found the voice and courage to attack Mr. Walesa.         ''You betrayed them,'' she said of the strikers beyond the shipyard walls. ''Now the authorities will crush us like bedbugs.''         She managed to shut one gate and pleaded for the strikers to stay and maintain the strike. Some lingered, but most rushed home to their families. But Ms. Pienkowska's message got through, and in many cases wives sent their husbands back; by nightfall the shipyard was filling up once more.         The strike had been salvaged in the spirit of solidarity, a word that would soon provide the free trade union movement with its name.         Among those who praised Ms. Pienkowska after her death was Andrzej Wajda, who said that she had been the model for a character in his film ''Man of Iron,'' which was based on events in the shipyard.         He said the actress who played the role spoke Ms. Pienkowska's words: ''Here in the shipyard I stopped being afraid, stopped running away, and became a real person.''         Immediately after her intervention, she was elected to a new strike committee that was able to negotiate the historic agreement guaranteeing workers the right to form unions independent of the government or the ruling Communist Party.         For the next decade she worked for Solidarity, both when it was legal and when it was outlawed in 1981. At the outset of the martial law period, she was detained and held for more than a year.         In 1983 she married Mr. Borusiewicz, who was in hiding, in a secret ceremony. A year later her husband, still a fugitive, attended the baptism of their son while disguised as an old woman. Mr. Walesa, a guest, unsuspectingly kissed his hand.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Kinga; and her son, Sebastian.       
         Percy Maxim Lee, a former president of the League of Women Voters of the United States, died on Saturday in New London, Conn. She was 96 and lived in Mystic, Conn.         Born July 4, 1906, in Hartford, Mrs. Lee was elected to the national board of the league in 1944, and served four terms as its president, from 1950 to 1958.         She was also a founder and trustee of the League of Women Voters Education Fund, the organization's educational arm, and was president of the league's Overseas Education Fund, which encourages political activity among women abroad, from 1959 to 1964.         Mrs. Lee is survived by two sons, John M., of Bloomfield, Conn., and Hamilton, of Mystic; two daughters, Percy Langstaff of Stamford, Conn., and Frances Heminway of Putney, Vt.; and 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
