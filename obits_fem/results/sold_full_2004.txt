         Janet Frame, whose vividly romantic explorations of madness and language in novels, poetry and autobiography propelled her to worldwide attention, died yesterday in Dunedin, New Zealand. She was 79.         Dunedin Hospital said the cause was acute leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         In 1973 she legally changed her surname to Clutha, after the river south of Oamaru, her childhood home, but continued to write under the name Janet Frame.         Ms. Frame's work used her own disturbing life to weave fictional nightmares that reflected, in her words, the ''homelessness of self.'' After a suicide attempt she spent eight years in mental hospitals in New Zealand, receiving 200 electroshock treatments. She was about to have a lobotomy when a hospital official read that she had won a literary prize. She was released.         Later, a panel of psychiatrists determined that she had never had schizophrenia. In the sort of bitterly perceptive, highly personalized twist that infuses much of her writing, that news did not please her.         ''Oh why had they robbed me of my schizophrenia, which had been the answer to all my misgivings about myself?'' she wrote in the third volume of her autobiography, which, with the first two, was dramatized in Jane Campion's 1990 film ''An Angel at My Table.''         ''Like King Lear I had gone in search of 'the truth' and now I had nothing,'' she continued.         Ms. Frame's 12 novels, four story collections, one poetry collection and three volumes of autobiography won dozens of awards.         ''As the body of her work has enlarged, one comes to understand it not just as a series of extraordinary insights into suffering and thought, but as a mighty exploration of human consciousness and its context in the natural world,'' the American Academy of Arts and Letters citation read when she was made an honorary foreign member in 1986.         In her novel ''The Edge of the Alphabet'' (Braziller, 1965) words literally crumble into meaninglessness and communication becomes useless. Even spelling becomes sinister. In ''Intensive Care'' (Braziller, 1970) she spells history hiss-tree to make an unsettling connection to Eden's serpent. ''All dreams,'' she wrote, ''lead back to the nightmare garden.''         Ms. Frame created romantic visionaries -- eccentrics, mad people, epileptics -- and pitted them against the repressive forces of a sterile, conformist society. Or maybe she was just reporting on her life. A continuing discussion among critics was whether her autobiographical work was mostly fiction or whether her fiction was mostly autobiographical.         Janet Paterson Frame was born on Aug. 28, 1924, in Dunedin. Her father was a railroad engineer. Her mother, who once worked as a maid in the home of the New Zealand writer Katherine Mansfield, wrote poems that she sold door to door.         Janet's youth was blighted by the drownings of two sisters. She attended the local teachers' training college, where she felt so lonely that she found peace sitting among tombstones in a cemetery. While practice teaching, she panicked when an inspector entered the classroom, and she fled, never to return. She suffered a breakdown that was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.         After her eight years in two psychiatric hospitals, she was befriended on her release by Frank Sargeson, a writer, who let her stay in an army hut in his backyard in Auckland, New Zealand. She wrote her first novel, ''Owls Do Cry'' (Pegasus, 1957), while staying there. The narrator was Daphne, a patient in a mental hospital.         She next traveled abroad on a grant from the New Zealand government, and in London a panel of psychiatrists determined she was not mentally ill, just different from other people. While living in Europe she published five novels from 1961 to 1963.         Ms. Frame is survived by her sister, June Gordon.         She returned to New Zealand in 1964 and wrote more novels, and three volumes of autobiography (Braziller, 1982, 1984, 1985). Despite the deep introspection of her writing, she developed a reputation as a private person.         In the early 1990's she had two mild strokes, which affected her mental stamina and power of concentration, but she continued to write.         ''Writing is a boon, analgesic, and so on,'' she said. ''I think it's all that matters to me. I dread emerging from it each day.''         Correction:  February 20, 2004, Friday  An obituary of the New Zealand novelist Janet Frame on Jan. 30 omitted attribution for a sentence describing the characters in her work: ''Ms. Frame created romantic visionaries -- eccentrics, mad people, epileptics -- and pitted them against the repressive forces of a sterile, conformist society.'' It was derived from the Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature (Oxford University Press), as reprinted on the New Zealand Book Council's web site, www.bookcouncil.org.nz.       
         Joan Delano Aiken, a prodigious weaver of tales for adults and children, died on Sunday at her home in Petworth, in West Sussex, England. She was 79.         Her death was announced by Brandt & Hochman, her literary agents, in New York.         Ms. Aiken's fiction could have a Dickensian atmosphere, evoke a somewhat skewed history of Olde England or be straightforward.         Much of it was in her chosen genre: nonhistorical adventure, tinged with suspense and horror, often featuring ghosts.         Her most famous book, ''The Wolves of Willoughby Chase,'' illustrated by Pat Marriott, appeared in 1962 and became an evergreen. It tells of two girls in a great English country house, and it leavens suspenseful Victorian melodrama with tongue-in-cheek humor.         Recommended for children in Grades 5 to 9, it was also turned into dramatic versions staged in many schools. Charles Schlesinger, an agent at Brandt & Hochman, said the book sold many thousands of copies every year in English and various translations; it is still in print in the 1987 Delacorte edition.         Mr. Schlesinger said that what is apparently her final book, ''The Witch of Clatteringshaws,'' is scheduled for publication by Delacorte next January. Her first, ''All You've Ever Wanted and Other Stories,'' was published 50 years ago.         In between she wrote more than 100 books, with ''Bone and Dream,'' ''The Scream,'' ''Ghostly Beasts,'' ''In Thunder's Pocket'' and ''Lady Catherine's Necklace,'' all published in Britain since 2000. As of last count, 29 of her books were in print in the United States.         Her ''Arabel's Raven'' series of humorous adventures, most of them also published in the United States, was adapted for television by the BBC. Her adult novels included mysteries and what she called her Jane Austen sequence, which included ''Mansfield Revisited'' (Doubleday, 1985), and ''Jane Fairfax: Jane Austen's Emma Through Another's Eyes'' (St. Martin's, 1991), a sequel to the Austen novel.         Joan Aiken was born in Rye, England, a daughter of the American poet Conrad Aiken and his first wife, Jessie McDonald. Having decided on a literary career early in life, she published some poetry in a prestigious little magazine but found that prose paid better.         She developed her story writing while working for the BBC and the Information Ministry during and just after World War II. She met her first husband, Ronald George Brown, a journalist, during that period.         They married in 1945 and had two children, John S. Brown and Elizabeth D. Charlaff, who survive her, along with Ms. Aiken's sister, Jane A. Hodge, and two grandchildren.         After Ron Brown's death in 1955, Ms. Aiken supported herself working as a features editor for British Argosy magazine and as a copywriter for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency. After 1961 she devoted herself exclusively to writing fiction.         She also spent some years as a trans-Atlantic commuter after her second marriage, to Julius Goldstein, in 1976. An artist and former member of the Hunter College faculty, he died in 2002.         Her work earned many honors, including an Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for ''Night Fall'' (Holt, 1970). In 1999 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to children's literature.       
         Georgette Klinger, who 60 years ago mixed a secret ingredient or two with common sense and created a recipe for clear skin -- and a chain of centers to pamper it -- died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said her daughter, Kathryn Klinger Belton. She was 88.         Miss Klinger, whose own complexion was a pampered milky white, began by treating the skin as a tender, living organ, not a surface in need of decoration, an approach that revolutionized cosmetic skin care. Her techniques for doing facials set the standard, as did her early use of herbal treatments, nutrition and exercise as part of skin care.         Before Miss Klinger, beauty treatment involved getting one's hair or makeup done, her daughter said. The new techniques Miss Klinger brought from Europe and further developed herself to revitalize skin helped lay the foundation for today's multibillion-dollar spa industry, and she widened the universe of those who enjoyed facials, devising treatments for men and teenagers.         She opened her Madison Avenue salon in 1941, and eventually had nine salons around the country. They quickly attracted socialites, movie stars and, later, movers and shakers like Helen Gurley Brown and Hillary Rodham Clinton.         In 1972, The New Yorker said that Miss Klinger was ''more than an imperious name scrawled in gilt across the white containers filled with her cosmetics and unguents.'' What separated her from the pack, the magazine suggested, was ''an affection for women and a concern for their faces that -- in a field set close with jostling prima donnas, despots, social arbiters and frauds -- are clearly genuine.''         Miss Klinger's own image was almost never without a hat, and she greatly preferred uncomfortable shoes to unfashionable ones. Her beloved poodle, Pushka, traveled in a Louis Vuitton case and lunched with her at the Carlyle Hotel.         She eschewed most advertising, in part because she disliked big words, and regarded washing one's face as perhaps the most important beauty treatment. ''I offer no miracles, no promises -- just clean skin,'' she said in an interview in 1976.         Georgette Eckstein was born in Brno, in what became Czechoslovakia. As a young woman she won a beauty contest and was given some cosmetics that irritated her skin. When dermatology treatments proved unsuccessful in curing her acne, she began experimenting with her own cures. She trained with dermatologists and cosmeticians in Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, as well as in Prague.         She opened her first salon in Czechoslovakia in 1938, but was forced to close it a year later when Hitler took over the country and she and her three brothers fled to London, her daughter said. Her parents stayed and vanished; she never learned what happened to them.         Miss Klinger got a bank loan to open her shop at 509 Madison Avenue. (She later moved to 501 Madison and outfitted the new shop with a swirling stairway of chrome and glass.) In the early years, she made all her products in her kitchen.         ''I was very lucky because I got some very famous people who had acne,'' Miss Klinger said in an interview with WWD in 1992. ''Actresses used to fly from Hollywood to see us.''         Step by patient step, she opened new salons, and in 1982 set up a separate laboratory and factory in New Jersey, which allowed her to expand the Georgette Klinger brand. Her company's revenues exceeded $20 million in 1988, when it was sold to the Pyle Group, a financial services and investment firm.         Miss Klinger's husband, Jacobo Klinger, died in 1976. In addition to her daughter, of Los Angeles, she is survived by two grandsons.         ''If I see someone leaving the salon who doesn't look their best, I say so, right in front of the employee,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Times in 1992. ''I tell them to redo her.         ''It's not very nice, I guess, but it has to be done.''       
         Irma Fleck, a physician's wife who looked at the vacant lots and abandoned buildings of her South Bronx neighborhood and retaliated by starting organizations to celebrate art and turn rubble piles into emerald oases, died on Feb. 11 in Naples, Fla.         She was 84 and lived in Naples.         The cause was complications after a broken hip, said her daughter, Bonnie Oppenberg.         Among many other initiatives, Mrs. Fleck helped develop the Claremont Neighborhood Center in the South Bronx, the Bronx Council on the Arts and the Bronx Museum. She also hatched a plan to turn compost from the Hunts Point Market into compost for developing lots that had been ravaged by arson.         ''When I work at something, it's like my child,'' she said in an interview with Newsday in 1994. ''I work intensively, and whatever the project, it becomes very important to me.''         Herman Badillo, a former Bronx borough president, said in an interview yesterday that he remembered Mrs. Fleck as being very aggressive in pursuing project after project.         ''She was one of the most active volunteers in the Bronx,'' he said.         Fernando Ferrer, another former Bronx borough president, said in an interview with The Riverdale Press last week that Mrs. Fleck ''put her own stamp on the Bronx in a very important way.''         Irma Lowenthal was born on Oct. 28, 1919, in Poland, the second of three children. Her father, a doctor, ran his practice out of the family's home near Crotona Park, in the heart of the South Bronx. In the three-story house, the family often put up Jewish refugees who like themselves had fled Hitler.         Miss Lowenthal graduated from Walton High School, earned degrees from Queens College and New York University and worked for her father as an X-ray technician. In 1940, she married Henry Fleck, a physician who had fled Europe in 1932. The newlyweds moved in with relatives on Washington Avenue in the Bronx.         The couple continued living in the Washington Avenue house, where Mrs. Fleck had two children, who survive her, Mrs. Oppenberg, of Marco Island, Fla., and Gary Fleck of Safat, Israel. She is also survived by two brothers, both of whom live in New Jersey, and two grandsons. Dr. Fleck died in 1990.         She believed a physician's wife should be active in the community in which he worked and in 1956 was a founder of the Claremont Neighborhood Center on East 169th Street. She was its president for 11 years, successfully pushing initiatives for affordable housing.         The Flecks moved to a penthouse on the Grand Concourse in the 1960's, and in the 1970's Mrs. Fleck held meetings there to try to reverse the decline of the South Bronx. Eventually, these meetings and contacts would lead to the Bronx Museum, which Mrs. Fleck helped found, forming a group in 1986 called the Committee to Make the Concourse Grand Again.         In 1967, Mrs. Fleck formed the Bronx Committee on the Arts. It soon merged with the Bronx Council on the Arts, formed by Gerald Klot in 1961. Mr. Klot's long involvement in the arts in the Bronx included organizing the Bronx Symphony Orchestra in 1945.         The new organization took the name of Mr. Klot's organization and found a home at the Bronx Community College, part of the City University of New York.         At first, ''We had a couple of drawers in a file there,'' Mrs. Fleck said in an interview with The New York Times in 1971.         The council soon found itself coordinating a host of cultural groups, including the Bronx Opera Company, the Bronx Experimental Theater, the Festival of Poetry and the Bronx Showcase of the Visual Arts.         Mrs. Fleck, as executive director of the council, was proudest of her role in creating the museum. It was housed until 1982 in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse, and from the beginning its exhibitions focused on contemporary artists, minority artists and artists from the Bronx.         In 1982, the museum took over the former Young Israel of the Concourse Synagogue, on the corner of 165th Street and the Grand Concourse, which had been sold to the city by its dwindling congregation. Mrs. Fleck raised public and private money to build an exhibition gallery, classrooms and offices, as well as a new glass-walled lobby.         Perhaps her best known accomplishment was collecting spoiling produce from the huge wholesale center at Hunts Point and selling it for compost. With Jack Flanagan, a former police officer, she formed the Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, which collected as much as 40 tons of compost daily.         The compost was used to fertilize new gardens on vacant lots. ''We're in the recycling business,'' Mrs. Fleck said. ''We're recycling land.''         When the vegetable market began to bag its waste in plastic, Mrs. Fleck persuaded the Bronx Zoo to give her the droppings of elephants and other herbivores to use for fertilizer. She called it ZooDoo, and sold some of it in two-pound bags for $2.50 in smart Manhattan stores.       
         M. M. Kaye, the British writer and illustrator, who wrote ''The Far Pavilions,'' a luxuriant evocation of her upbringing in the India of the British Raj, died last Thursday. She was 95 and lived in Suffolk, England.         Her death was announced Tuesday by her New York agents, Harold Ober Associates.         Mary Margaret Kaye -- or Mrs. Hamilton, as she was also known -- started a moderately successful writing career in the late 1930's. She had filled a medium-size bookshelf with children's books, novels and mysteries before she published her blockbuster of a historical romance in 1978.         ''The Far Pavilions,'' published in the United States by St. Martin's Press, was an immediate best seller. Set at the zenith of Britain's Indian Empire and covering a period from roughly 1885 to 1920, it led to a television mini-series in 1984, sold millions of copies around the world and remains in print, as do a dozen of her other books.         Using her nickname Mollie Kaye, she wrote stories for younger readers, like her ''Potter Pinner'' series (1937-41), and ''Black Bramble Wood'' (1938). Some of her other books were ascribed to Mollie Hamilton.         She had written two earlier historical romances of lesser renown, ''Shadow of the Moon'' (1956) and ''Trade Wind'' (1963). The first dramatized events of the Indian Mutiny of 1857 as witnessed by an orphaned Anglo-Spanish heiress sent to India to marry. ''Trade Wind,'' set in Zanzibar, similarly tells a story of conflicting cultures.         ''Far Pavilions,'' nearly 1,000 pages long, was written over about 16 years and relived a world of the viceroys and maharajahs that its author knew well. She was born in Simla, summer residence of the British viceroy. Her father, Sir Cecil Kaye, was titular head of an Indian state, Rajputana. Her husband, Maj. Gen. Goff Hamilton, served with Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides, as had his father.         She started the book in 1964, but it had barely reached three chapters, when a diagnosis of cancer stopped her. She picked it up four years later, upon her husband's retirement, and kept writing and doing the research for it in England while fighting her illness.         The result has been compared by some to the Civil War epic ''Gone With the Wind.'' She said she ''just let the book take over and write itself.'' It surprised her, she said, when Thomas McCormack, president of St. Martin's Press, acquired the manuscript without cuts.         Her other work thrived as well, thanks to the fame of ''The Far Pavilions.'' She had written many detective and mystery novels, beginning with ''Death Walked in Kashmir'' (1953) and continuing into the mid-1990's. The settings of the books shifted with her husband's postings, from Berlin to Cyprus to Kenya. They, too, remain in print.         In ''The Far Pavilions,'' passions, intrigue and narrow escapes involve concubines, dashing heroes and princesses. Its television adaptation, presented in installments, starred Ben Cross and Amy Irving and featured Omar Sharif, Christopher Lee and John Gielgud.         Miss Kaye edited several volumes of poetry by Rudyard Kipling and wrote an autobiographical trilogy, ''The Sun in the Morning: My Early Years in India and England'' (St. Martin's, 1990), ''Golden Afternoon'' (St. Martin's, 1998), and ''Enchanted Evening'' (Viking, 1999). All remain in print.         General Hamilton died in 1985. They had two daughters, Carolyn and Nicky, who survive, according to The Telegraph of London, as does a stepdaughter. Speaking of pseudonyms as a writer's alter egos, Miss Kaye told Herbert Mitgang of The New York Times in 1978, ''If you're writing about rabbits, readers might not take you seriously with a large historical romance under the same name.''       
         Jill Kornblee, an art dealer whose Manhattan gallery handled the work of many well-known contemporary artists early in their careers, died on Jan. 29 in Branford, Conn. She was 84 and lived in Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Elisabeth Kornblee.         Born in New York City in 1920, Ms. Kornblee studied at Bryn Mawr College and later took art history courses at New York University's Institute of Fine Art. In 1961, with two partners, she bought the Barone Gallery on Madison Avenue near 79th Street. She soon took over her partners' interests and began operating the gallery under her own name.         An energetic dealer, receptive to new talent, Ms. Kornblee gave shows in the 1960's and 70's to a number of artists whose work is now well known. Among them were the British painter Howard Hodgkin, whose first solo exhibition in this country sold out at the gallery in 1973. Others included Dan Flavin, Malcolm Morley, Rackstraw Downes, Al Hansen, Janet Fish, Richard Smith, Peter Phillips, Mon Levinson and Michael Mazur.         She also had close friendships with other dealers, among them Leo Castelli, Ivan Karp, Allan Stone, John Bernard Myers and Betty Parsons. The Kornblee Gallery mounted several shows of work by Ms. Parsons, who was also an artist.         In the mid-1960's Ms. Kornblee moved the gallery to 58 East 79th Street, and in the late 70's to 20 West 57th Street, where it remained until she retired in 1986.         In addition to her daughter Elisabeth, who lives in Boston, Ms. Kornblee is survived by her husband, Dr. Leonard V. Kornblee of Weston; another daughter, Mary K. Gabriel, also of Boston; a son, John C. Kornblee of Rocky Hill, Conn.; and three grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Denny Scardino, a jazz pianist who rubbed elbows with the form's superstars but found her biggest following through a 25-year gig in a Manhattan bank lobby, died on March 9 at a hospice. She was 82 and had recently been told that she had cancer, her son Donald said.         Drawn to the city from a dairy farm in tiny Jefferson, N.Y., Mrs. Scardino played with the Joe Venuti Band and at the Stork Club during World War II.         ''Her goal was to come to New York and be surrounded by people, and play the piano,'' her son said. She appeared with Lester Lanin's Society Orchestra, and recorded two collections for the A440 label, ''Dottie Denny Digs the Duke'' and ''Dottie Denny Plays Edgar Sampson.''         After marrying Charles Scardino, a bass player, she put aside her career to raise their four children in Queens. With the children grown, she took a job playing classics on a grand piano inside the Manhattan Savings Bank branch at Third Avenue and 86th Street.         She started in 1970, at the invitation of the branch manager, and regaled the customers with her interpretations of hits by Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, Stephen Sondheim and others. People came in just to listen, tapping their toes in time to her music, and some may have opened accounts because of her. She played there until 1995, when the bank was sold and its new owner decided to do away with the music.         Always elegantly dressed, Mrs. Scardino played what appealed to her, but she also took requests from her audience, which often included people from the neighborhood who did not have accounts at the bank.         When she was cast in an episode of the television series ''The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' the title character, after a loan application was rejected, asked her to play ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?''         In addition to her son Donald, of Scarsdale, N.Y., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Coe of Montevallo, Ala.; two other sons, Charles Jr., of Manhattan, and David, of Los Angeles; and eight grandchildren.       
         Estée Lauder, the last great independent titan of the cosmetics industry, who convinced generations of women that her beauty creams were ''jars of hope'' in their quest for the eternal look of youth, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her family, in announcing her death, said she was 97.         ''The pursuit of beauty is honorable,'' Mrs. Lauder used to say. And she clearly believed that the business of beauty was just as honorable. No one but a believer could have given so much of herself in becoming an internationally respected strategist in the age-old struggle against wrinkles, sags, bags and blemishes. Her weapons in that effort were creams, powders, ointments, potions and muds, many containing top-secret emollients. And if they didn't do the trick, she had an array of scents, equally secret in their constitution, that might befog man's vision of woman aging.         Her efforts resulted in the establishment of a company estimated to be worth about $5 billion when it went public in 1995 and she was given the title of founding chairwoman. In 2003, it had 21,500 employees and an estimated worth of about $10 billion. Its products are sold in more than 130 countries across five continents.         Estée Lauder Companies was not formally established until 1946 but its roots go back to the 1920's with facial creams concocted over a gas stove in a modest kitchen by Mrs. Lauder's uncle, John Schotz. It was nurtured financially and technically years later by Arnold L. van Ameringen, a Dutch-born industrialist. The company grew exponentially in the 1950's with the introduction of a bath oil called Youth-Dew, the creation of which is variously attributed to Mrs. Lauder and Mr. van Ameringen.         In the years after the start of her almost messianic crusade to give women the perennial bloom of youth, Mrs. Lauder marketed a variety of other beauty aids, among them Super-Rich All Purpose Creme, Cleaning Oil, Creme Pack and a skin lotion (all of them the creations of Dr. Schotz). In all, she marketed some 2,000 individual shades and items produced by five Lauder companies: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Prescriptives and (for men) Aramis. Among the fragrances she introduced were Estée (1968), Azuree (1969), Aliage (1972), Private Collection (1973), Beautiful (1985) and Pleasures (1995).         In 1995 the company also entered into a licensing agreement with the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to market Tommy, a line of fragrances, and with Make-Up Artists Cosmetics of Toronto to distribute its MAC products outside North America.         ''I love my product,'' Mrs. Lauder once said. ''I love to touch the creams, smell them, look at them, carry them with me. A person has to love her harvest if she's to expect others to love it.''         Mrs. Lauder also loved to touch her customers. During the period when she was building her business, she invariably showed up at stores where her products were being introduced and, with no provocation at all, whip out a jar and rub its contents on the wrist or face of a prospective customer so that her skin would acquire ''a gentle glow.''         She also understood the rewards that come from generosity and she was known in the industry for her free samples and particularly for the concept of ''gift with purchase.'' She introduced these creative marketing measures when her company was in its infancy and she was advised by an agency that the $50,000 she had available for advertising was not enough to have any effect.         Although she was protective toward those who trusted her to create effective products, she used stark candor to describe her competitors, all of them ferocious and all of whom she outlived by many years. She referred to Charles Revson as ''my arch and implacable enemy'' and she said that Elizabeth Arden was ''not a nice woman, not a generous woman.'' She said that Sam Rubin of Fabergé was ''patronizing even for those prefeminist days'' and that although Helena Rubenstein may have looked like a czarina, ''the skin on her neck was less than perfect.''         Perfection in the face of woman consumed Mrs. Lauder, and so did her desire to make a lot of money and leave the conditions of her childhood behind her. ''Someday, I will have whatever I want,'' she is said to have predicted many years ago. By the late 1980's, with personal assets of $233 million and a listing in Forbes's gallery of the 400 richest Americans, it was clear that she had made her prediction come true.         Although the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry led many women to believe that Estée Lauder was born in Europe to an aristocratic family, she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all. Josephine Esther Mentzer was born at home in Corona, Queens, on July 1, 1908, according to several biographies, although her family believes it may have been two years earlier. She was the daughter of Max Mentzer, a hardware man who was the proprietor of a hay and seed store, and Rose Schotz Rosenthal Mentzer, a woman who was much interested in beauty regimens.         The Mentzers were hard-working immigrants and Esther, destined to become known to the world by the diminutive of Estée, recalled well the Christmastime wrapping of gifts of hammers and nails, her father's gifts to his customers.         In her 1985 autobiography, ''Estée, A Success Story,'' Mrs. Lauder recalled her mother as ''a Hungarian beauty whose mother was a French Catholic and whose father was a Hungarian Jew.'' She described her father as ''an elegant, dapper monarchist in Europe, who, when transported to a new country, still carried a cane and gloves on Sundays.''         In interviews conducted over the years with various journalists, Mrs. Lauder said much that indicated her beginnings were quite genteel and comfortable. But Lee Israel, whose unauthorized biography, ''Estée Lauder, Beyond the Magic,'' was also published in 1985, maintained that the Lauder family's life in a working-class Italian neighborhood was much more modest than Mrs. Lauder would acknowledge.         Whatever her circumstances, there was no quarrel about the suggestion that as a young girl, Estée, a petite blonde, was known for her lovely skin and her determination to always look good. This determination was heightened when, as a student at Newtown High School in Queens, she became interested in the work of her uncle, John Schotz.         He had come to the United States from Hungary in 1900 with considerable training in chemistry. People referred to him as Dr. Schotz, although it is not clear that he had a doctorate. Whatever his background, he created a number of beauty products, including Six-in-One Cold Cream, Dr. Schotz Viennese Cream and a number of fragrances.         But the New Way Laboratory, which he created in 1924, was hardly limited to the needs of the beautiful people. It also produced a poultry-lice killer, a cure for mange, suppositories, a cream that was touted as promoting the building of muscles, a freckle remover and even embalming fluid. Years later, a chemist for Revlon said that although Dr. Schotz's beauty-care products were heavy and ''very old fashioned,'' they were good for their time and effective, especially for dry skin. One of the Schotz products even contained a primitive form of sunscreen.         Estée studied his homemade products closely and, since Dr. Schotz was no businessman, helped him to sell them. Estée said little about her past and it is not clear that she even graduated from Newtown High. But in school or out, she remained fascinated with his beauty aids and was still promoting them in 1930 when she married Joseph Lauter, whom she had been dating for about three years. He was the son of William and Lillian Lauter, who had come to the United States from the part of Austria known as Galicia. Mr. Lauter had tried his hand without much success in both the silk and button businesses. The name was changed to ''Lauder'' later in the decade.         Their marriage foundered and they were divorced in 1939. Their separation lasted until 1942, when Estée told her friends that Mr. Lauder was a very nice man and that ''I don't know why I broke off with him.'' They remarried that December and remained together until his death in 1982.         She is survived by her sons, Leonard A., the chairman of the company, and Ronald S., chairman of Clinique Laboratories; four grandchildren, including William, who will become chief executive of the Estée Lauder Companies on July 1; and six great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Lauder and her husband were apart she met and became close to Mr. van Ameringen, who became president and chairman of International Flavors and Fragrances, a company that formulates fragrances for many well-known beauty houses and has no connection with the Lauder empire. They became lifelong friends and Mr. van Ameringen provided both credit and, some said, product formula for the firm that would bear Mrs. Lauder's name. From the beginning, she was its chief executive and made its most important marketing and product development decisions.         In 1944, the Lauders opened concessions in beauty salons in New York and sold products to out-of-town salons through jobbers. Leonard Lauder, who became president of the company in the 1970's, recalled that ''we had a Boston wholesaler, the Samuel Bernstein Hair Company, and Mr. Bernstein used to talk to me about his son Lenny.''         Mrs. Lauder would go on the road, trying to induce finer stores to feature her merchandise. ''I have the secrets,'' she would tell prospective clients. ''Start the New Year with a new face.''         The concessions were closed in 1946 and gradually the company sold to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. That helped to give her products the prestigious aura they needed for more aggressive marketing.         The introduction of Youth-Dew and Mrs. Lauder's sales expertise combined to take the company from a sales volume of no more than $400 a week to around $5,000 in the early 1950's. It still had no sales staff as such, but it was gaining an image of quality from the department stores in which it was displayed. By 1958, when Leonard joined the company, sales had soared to about $800,000 a year.         The company began to grow more rapidly. In 1965, Mrs. Lauder opened her first beauty ''spa'' in Bloomingdale's New York store. She planned her counters personally and determined that each ''would be a tiny, shining spa -- complete.''         ''I'd make sure the color I chose was the same wonderful 'in between a blue and a green' that whispered elegance, aristocracy, and also complemented bathroom wallpapers,'' she said.         By this time, Estée Lauder was well on her way to becoming the doyenne of beauty and her list of friends began to reflect her regal image. The Duchess of Windsor had long been a friend and now there were others. Princess Grace of Monaco sent her Christmas cards and visited her in New York. Many socially prominent people invited her to their parties, among them the Begum Aga Khan, C. Z. Guest, Nancy Reagan and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. In January 1978, when she received the Legion of Honor, it did not seem to bother the French that Estée Lauder's fragrances were outselling Chanel's by 3 to 1. Gerard Gaussen, the consul general of France, said that she ''represents what we French admire most about Americans -- brains and heart.''         Mrs. Lauder was a generous contributor to civic causes and charities. The Lauder Foundation was set up in the 1960's and it has, among other things, set up three playgrounds in Central Park. The Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies was founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.         It was probably inevitable that such a woman would have her detractors, too. Some said Mrs. Lauder had never adequately compensated John Schotz, who died in the 1960's in modest circumstances at a time when Estée Lauder Inc. was grossing around $14 million a year. Others, according to her biographer, Lee Israel, complained that she denied or played down her Jewishness (Ms. Israel said that Mrs. Lauder told one interviewer that she was half Italian and convent-bred), that she was a name-dropper, a social climber, and not entirely loyal. Ms. Israel quotes an ex-secretary to the duchess of Windsor as complaining that after the duke died and the duchess became infirm, Mrs. Lauder ''deserted'' her.         Unperturbed by the naysayers, Mrs. Lauder lived life vigorously, taking from it what she wanted and rejecting things that would take her away from the people and places she knew. Thus, she rejected President Nixon's offer to make her ambassador to Luxembourg (she blamed her husband, who reportedly said, ''I'm not going to carry her bags'').         In 1982, she demonstrated her approach to life. When she felt that her ruby and diamond tiara clashed horribly with her turquoise dress, she immediately switched to a more suitable gold and diamond crown. ''You know how it is,'' she told Charlotte Curtis of The New York Times. ''You have to wear something.''       
         Eileen Darby Lester, a photographer who helped immortalize theatrical productions, taking pictures of more than 500 Broadway shows and photographing stars like Olivier, Dietrich and Brando, died on March 30 at a nursing home in Long Beach, N.Y. She was 87.         Her death followed a fall in front of her house in Point Lookout, N.Y., in November from which she never recovered, said Mary Henderson, who is writing a book about her.         Mrs. Lester, whose photographic credits used her maiden name, Darby, recorded images that have helped define the memory of some great productions. These include the picture of a terrified Blanche DuBois, played by Jessica Tandy, at the feet of a menacing Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) in Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire.''         Her photograph of the original production of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' showing Jo Mielziner's entire set, was widely published.         Among the stars she photographed were Tallulah Bankhead, the Lunts, Helen Hayes, Gregory Peck, Katharine Hepburn and Paul Robeson. Other assignments included shooting Mayor Fiorello La Guardia at Yankee Stadium, Leonard Bernstein and President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline.         Eileen Darby was born in Portland, Ore., on May 12, 1916. Her father was an engineer who worked for the federal government and liked to photograph the dams and other large projects on which he worked. He taught his daughter photography and helped her set up her own darkroom, Dr. Henderson said.         Mrs. Lester studied biology at Marylhurst University near Portland, but left college at 20 to pursue photography in Manhattan.         She got a job with Pix, a Manhattan photo agency founded by Alfred Eisenstaedt. There she developed particular expertise at processing photographs and a reputation for going beyond what was necessary to make her subjects feel comfortable, Dr. Henderson said. She once turned down a chance to shoot Ingrid Bergman, whom she greatly admired, for fear of giving her a cold that she had.         In 1941 she left Pix and joined a few friends to form Graphic House, a photo agency. Many professional photographers dropped off their film there for processing, and she got to know them. Through a Life magazine photographer, she met Roy Lester, who eventually took over management of the agency and whom she married in 1944.         It was for Graphic House that many of her most notable pictures were taken. They were sold to many prominent publications.         Mr. Lester died in 1976. Mrs. Lester is survived by a daughter, Virginia Teslik of West Hills, Calif.; her sons Roy Jr., of Long Beach; John, of Mountain Lakes, N.J.; and Patric of St. Louis and San Diego; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Lester stopped taking theatrical pictures after her husband died, Dr. Henderson said, because she felt dispirited about Broadway's new directions after the musical ''Hair'' opened in 1968.         Correction:  May 18, 2004, Tuesday  An obituary on April 13 about Eileen Darby, a photographer of Broadway productions, misstated Alfred Eisenstaedt's role at Pix, a photo agency where she worked. He was an early photographer there, not the founder. The agency was founded by Leon Daniels. A reader pointed out the error by email on the day of publication. This correction was delayed for research into conflicting accounts of the agency's early days; some described Eisenstaedt as a co-founder.       
         Lillian Seril, who as landlord of a grand Upper West Side apartment building, the Belnord, became the central figure in one of New York City's longest rent strikes, died on Monday at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and had been living as a tenant at the building she once owned, at 225 West 86th Street.         Her death was announced by her family in a paid notice in The New York Times.         The 16-year battle between Mrs. Seril and her tenants played out on a suitably historic stage. The Belnord, an ornate Italian Renaissance building 12 stories tall, occupies the entire block between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. It was advertised as the largest apartment house in the world when it was completed in 1908 and was designated as a New York City landmark in 1966.         Designed to be one of the city's most luxurious residences, it has huge, high-ceilinged apartments and surrounds a half-acre courtyard. It became a center of the Upper West Side's intellectual life, home over the years to figures like the Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Actors Studio founder Lee Strasberg and the actor Zero Mostel.         But the Belnord was more than a glamorous address; it also was one of Manhattan's biggest real estate bargains. When Mrs. Seril and her husband, Nathan, became sole owners of the building in 1974, two-thirds of its 225 apartments were covered under the city's rent control law, which originated as a federal plan in World War II to prevent war profiteering. With prices averaging $60 per room, tenants of rent-controlled 10-room apartments could pay less than $500 per month, well below the market rate even then.         Upon taking over the building, the Serils said some tenants owed back rent and accused others of infractions from illegal subletting to ripping out fixtures to installing appliances that put a dangerous strain on the building's wires and pipes.         Tenants had their own complaints: elevators frequently went out of service; pipes burst; the roof leaked; plaster fell from ceilings: the building often had no hot water, or no water at all. The tenants also said the Serils would not allow them to make repairs themselves.         To the Serils, these problems were a simple matter of economics. As their son-in-law, Owen C. Pell, later told said, ''If you keep the rents in the building lower than they are in the South Bronx, how do you stop the property from running down?''         The rent strike began in 1978, joined by nearly half of the Belnord's residents. It was soon followed by litigation that became so bitter that the Manhattan Housing Court judge originally assigned to the case withdrew in 1980 after the collapse of a settlement he had arranged, saying that the two sides ''deserved each other.''         When the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development was asked to intervene in the dispute four years later, he said, ''I'm not going to get myself into a West Beirut situation, where one or both parties are shooting at us.''         The battle continued through the 1980's, outliving Mr. Seril, who died in 1981. At one point, a court-appointed administrator was put in charge of the building, a step usually taken against slumlords. Later, a justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that many strikers were withholding rent to force Mrs. Seril to sell the building or to convert it to condominiums or cooperatives; he also found that some of the strikers were failing to place their withheld rent in escrow, in effect living rent free.         The strike finally came to an end in October 1994, when Mrs. Seril agreed to sell the building to investors for $15 million, or about $66,000 an apartment. Experts estimated that she could have asked two or three times as much if the rents had been at market level and the building had been in better shape.         Her opponents were surprised when she finally sold the Belnord.         ''Mrs. Seril has turned down many offers from buyers,'' a tenant leader said. ''The tenants have even offered to buy the building. This is not about money.''         Born Lillian Trachtenberg, Mrs. Seril is survived by her daughters Barbara and Pearl, her stepdaughter Zena Carp, her sisters Ada Hinden and Gladys Feigenbaum, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Seril remained a part of the Belnord saga even after selling the building. In a long speech before the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1996, she criticized the new owners' renovation plans and their intention of putting a large supermarket in the building's basement. This time Mrs. Seril, who lived in a 3,000-square-foot, $450-a-month, rent-controlled apartment in the Belnord, was speaking as a tenant.       
         Lilian Moore, a writer of books for children, a poet and an editor who helped make children's books more affordable and worked to combat racial stereotypes in children's literature, died July 20 at her home in Seattle, said her son, Jonathan. She was 95.         A longtime resident of New York City, Ms. Moore was an editor at Scholastic when she suggested in 1957 that the company make its books more accessible by offering low-cost paperbacks through the mail; there were few paperback books for children at the time. She became the first editor of Scholastic's Arrow Book Club, a series of inexpensive editions for pupils in the fourth through sixth grades, and the Lucky Book Club, a similar program for younger readers.         Seven years later, after her stepson, Richard Moore, returned from a summer of civil-rights work in Mississippi and told her that black children there had no books about their own experience, she helped establish the Council on Interracial Books for Children. The council works to discover and encourage minority writers and to confront stereotypes in books for children.         Ms. Moore was also a prolific writer of children's books, including ''Old Rosie, the Horse Nobody Understood'' (1960).         Her ''Little Raccoon'' series, which is still in print in the United States, was translated into Russian and has sold more than 375,000 copies in Russia.         Ms. Moore began writing poetry for children in the late 1960's. In books including ''I Thought I Heard the City'' and ''Sam's Place: Poems From the Country,'' she explored her own childhood memories and wrote about the joy of finding beauty in familiar and unexpected places.         Born Lilian Levenson in the Bronx in 1909 to Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Russia, she graduated from Hunter College in 1930. Unable to find a permanent teaching job during the Depression, she joined the Unemployed Teachers Council and edited its newspaper, The Unemployed Teacher.         As a part-time teacher working with truants, she discovered her ability to help children learn to read. She eventually became a reading specialist in the New York City school system and began writing for children soon after, publishing her first stories in Humpty Dumpty's Magazine.         She is survived by a son from her second marriage, Jonathan Moore of Seattle, and a brother, Milton Levenson of Manhattan. Her third husband, Sam Reavin, died in the early 1990's. Ms. Moore's final books, ''Mural on Second Avenue, and Other City Poems'' and ''Scary Poems,'' will be published posthumously.         Correction:  August 5, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Lilian Moore, a children's author, misstated her role with Scholastic's Lucky Book Club for younger pupils. She was not its first editor; that was the writer and poet Beatrice Schenck de Regniers. (Ms. Moore was, however, the first editor of the company's Arrow Book Club, for pupils in Grades 4 to 6.)       
         Fay Wray, an actress who appeared in about 100 movies but whose fame is inextricably linked with the hours she spent struggling, helplessly screaming, in the eight-foot hand of King Kong, died on Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 96.         Rick McKay, a director and her friend, said she died peacefully in her sleep. He recalled that Miss Wray's family moved to the United States from Canada in a stagecoach and said that she was possibly the longest-living true star of silent films.         As sound and color came to the movies, Miss Wray remained at the top, but it was the celebrated role that took her to the top of a very tall building that elevated her to cinematic immortality.         The huge success of ''King Kong,'' a beauty-and-the-beast film that opened in New York at both Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy in 1933, led to roles for Miss Wray in other 1930's films in which her life or her virtue, or both, were imperiled. But she was always aware that she would be remembered for the pivotal scene of ''King Kong,'' in which the giant ape carries her to the top of the Empire State Building, gently places her on a ledge, lunges furiously at fighter planes peppering him with bullets and falls to his death.         ''When I'm in New York,'' Miss Wray wrote in The New York Times in 1969, ''I look at the Empire State Building and feel as though it belongs to me, or is it vice versa?''         The most hazardous part of filming ''King Kong,'' Miss Wray recalled, was the tendency of the giant gorilla hand to loosen its grasp while she was suspended high above the set. When she felt she was about to fall, she implored the director, Merian C. Cooper, to have her lowered to the stage floor to rest a few minutes before being secured once again in the hand and sent aloft.         She spent an entire day recording additional screams, variously shrill and plaintive, that an editor later inserted in the soundtrack -- too often, she later emphasized. Asked how she was able to muster such animated cries, she replied, ''I made myself believe that the nearest possible hope of rescue was at least a mile away.''         Over the years, Miss Wray said, she came to feel that Kong had ''become a spiritual thing to many people, including me.''         In a 1987 interview, Miss Wray said she had been sent a script for the 1976 remake of ''King Kong,'' in which Jessica Lange played Kong's co-star, because its producers wanted her to play a small role. She said she disliked the script and declined the offer because ''the film I made was so extraordinary, so full of imagination and special effects, that it will never be equaled.''         Fay Wray was born on Sept. 15, 1907, on a farm in Alberta, a daughter of Jerry Wray, an inventor, and his wife, Vina. Vina Wray and her three daughters moved to Arizona by stagecoach when Fay was 3, and to Lark, Utah, when she was 5. Her father and two brothers had gone ahead.         By the time Fay was 12 or 13, her parents had separated, a sister had died of the flu, and the family was struggling financially. Fay's mother sent her to Los Angeles to live with a friend and pursue a movie career. She appeared in her first film, ''Gasoline Love,'' in 1923. She was an ingénue in a half-dozen silent westerns.         Her breakthrough came when Erich von Stroheim chose her to play the bride in his 1928 silent classic ''The Wedding March.'' Miss Wray was always drawn to writers, as she recounted in her 1989 autobiography, ''On the Other Hand.'' She was just 19 when she married John Monk Saunders, a Rhodes scholar and screenwriter known for films like ''Wings.'' She divorced him, she said, after he injected her with drugs while she slept, sold their house and their furniture and kept the money, and disappeared for a time with their baby daughter, Susan. Saunders hanged himself in 1940.         She was pursued by Sinclair Lewis and had a long romance with Clifford Odets. In 1942 she married Robert Riskin, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of ''It Happened One Night.'' They had two children, Vicki and Robert Jr. Riskin had a stroke in 1950 and died five years later. In 1971, she married Dr. Sanford Rothenberg, a neurosurgeon who had been one of Riskin's doctors. Dr. Rothenberg died in 1991.         Miss Wray retired in 1942 but made occasional movies in the 1950's and had a leading role in ''Gideon's Trumpet,'' a 1979 film with Henry Fonda. On television, she starred in a situation comedy, ''The Pride of the Family,'' from 1953 to 1955. In later years she also wrote plays that were produced in regional theaters.         Miss Wray is survived by her daughters Susan Riskin of Manhattan and Victoria Riskin of Los Angeles; her son, Robert Riskin Jr., of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.         In 1997, Miss Wray joined Julius Epstein, a writer of the film ''Casablanca,'' to testify to Congress in favor of greater copyright protection for pre-1960's film writers.         Last March Peter Jackson, the director, asked her over dinner if she would appear in his remake of ''King Kong.'' He wanted her to read the summary line, '''Twas beauty killed the beast.''         She thought that might be too confusing, said Mr. McKay, who was host at the dinner.         ''How can someone play me when I'm here?'' she asked.       
         Françoise Sagan, the rebellious French writer who achieved fame as a teenager with her first novel, ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' a precocious tale of sexual disillusionment, but whose international reputation dimmed as literary tastes changed, died yesterday in Honfleur, in northern France. She was 69.         The cause was a blood clot in a lung, friends of her family told Agence France-Presse. She had been in poor health for several years.         Ms. Sagan had an enormous international success with ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' about an amoral teenager who sets out to keep her philandering widowed father from marrying again. The novel was originally published in France in 1954. The following year an English translation reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Sagan was only 19, making her the youngest author to achieve that feat at the time.         By early 1958, the book had sold 810,000 copies in France and more than a million in the United States and had been translated into 20 languages.         Serge Gavronsky, a professor of French literature at Barnard College, said in a 1995 interview that Ms. Sagan's early novels expressed the rebelliousness and cynicism of many of her peers in the French bourgeoisie. Those books, he said, ''were perfectly in accord with a moment of time'' -- the mid-1950's -- and ''well connected'' with France's literary past.         John Updike, writing in The New Yorker 20 years after ''Bonjour Tristesse'' appeared, praised ''its sparkling sea and secluding woods, its animal quickness, its academically efficient plot, its heroes and heroines given the perfection of Racine personae by the young author's innocent belief in glamour.''         Later works by Ms. Sagan appeared repeatedly on best-seller lists in France, and she went on to write more than a score of books, as well as plays, film scripts, short stories and song lyrics. Some of her novels were turned into movies -- ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and ''A Certain Smile'' in 1958 -- and she directed the 1977 French film ''Les Fougères Bleues.''         ''Les Auteurs de la Littérature Française,'' a standard French work for students, described Ms. Sagan's terrain as somewhat limited: ''a worldly, rich, idle, luxurious universe; some characters who live without material cares, who drink, who love themselves without conviction. A taste for the unfinished, for biting analysis, for narcissism. Sagan has forever been recounting the rotting of a generation.''         Roger Shattuck, a cultural historian and professor of French at Boston University, said in 1995 that Ms. Sagan's reputation ''had declined considerably after her first half-dozen novels'' because she wrote too much and repeated herself and because of changing literary fashions.         Ms. Sagan's view of herself and her life was sometimes harsh. In ''Et Toute Ma Sympathie,'' a 1993 book made up largely of reflections, she included a poem in which she called herself ''this bizarre woman, childish and messed up.''         In the first flush of Ms. Sagan's fame, she became known for drinking until dawn and gambling lavishly. It has been reported that she once made a killing at the gaming tables of Deauville and then turned around and used the money to buy herself a turn-of-the-century chateau.         She also praised the joys of driving sports cars. ''Whoever has not thrilled to speed has not thrilled to life,'' she wrote in ''With Fondest Regards'' (1985). ''However madly and hopelessly in love you may be, at 120 miles an hour you are less so. Your blood no longer congeals around your heart; your blood throbs to the extremities of your body, to your fingertips, your toes and your eyelids, now the fateful and tireless guardians of your own life.''         She suffered a skull fracture and other injuries in 1957 when her Aston-Martin overturned while she was living in Milly, a resort town in northern France.         Ms. Sagan was convicted twice of narcotics offenses, in 1990 and 1995, receiving fines and prison sentences, which were suspended.         She once told an investigating magistrate: ''I believe I have a right to destroy myself as long as it does not harm anyone. If I feel like swallowing a glass of caustic soda, that's my own problem.''In 2002 she was also convicted of tax fraud in a case involving payments she received in the early 1990's to intercede with François Mitterrand, a friend and then the president of France, in an oil deal. Her health prevented her from appearing in court.         Ms. Sagan was born on June 21, 1935, in Cajarc, a village in southwest France. She was the third and youngest child of Paul Quoirez, a well-to-do businessman, and his wife, Marie.         Françoise Quoirez, nicknamed Kiki, grew up largely in Lyons and on an estate in the Vercors region in the southeast. When she was 15, her family moved to Paris. She attended convent schools before an unsuccessful academic experience at the Sorbonne.         She took the pen name Sagan because she liked the way it sounded. The name also harked back to the Prince and Princesse de Sagan, 19th-century Parisians on whom Marcel Proust is said to have based some of his characters.         After two years at the Sorbonne, with much time spent in cafes and little studying, she failed crucial year-end examinations in June 1953, angering her family. She felt she ''had to do something'' to placate them, she would recall, so she sat down and wrote ''Bonjour Tristesse'' in August. She had already been thinking about the novel and making notes for it for some months.         The book begins with what has come to be seen as a vintage Sagan sentence: ''A strange melancholy pervades me, to which I hesitate to give the grave and beautiful name of sorrow.''         In ''With Fondest Regards,'' Ms. Sagan, noting that ''Bonjour Tristesse'' enjoyed a ''succès de scandale'' when it first came out in France, said that in those days she could not understand what all the fuss was about.         Looking back three decades later, she said the furor resulted partly from the relationship between the heroine, Cécile, and her boyfriend.         ''It was inconceivable,'' she wrote, ''that a young girl of 17 or 18 should make love without being in love with a boy of her own age, and not be punished for it.''         Furthermore, she added, people couldn't accept that this girl ''should know about her father's love affairs, discuss them with him, and thereby reach a kind of complicity with him on subjects that had until then been taboo between parents and children.''         Ms. Sagan continued to weave fiction from sentences that were a bit abstract in the French way but that at their best dealt trenchantly and economically with the emotions.         Her other novels published in translation in the United States include ''A Certain Smile'' (1956), ''Those Without Shadows'' (1957), ''Aimez-Vous Brahms?'' (1960), ''Wonderful Clouds'' (1962), ''La Chamade'' (1966), ''The Heart-Keeper'' (1968), ''A Few Hours of Sunlight'' (1971), ''The Painted Lady'' (1983), ''Incidental Music'' and ''Salad Days'' (1984).         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1983, Nora Johnson praised ''the grace and freshness of her early novels, those slender tales of love between aged children and middle-aged burnouts that seemed so remarkable when they began appearing in the 50's,'' observing that Ms. Sagan ''seemed to know everything then.''         Ms. Sagan won the Prix des Critiques in 1954 for ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and the Prix de Monaco 30 years later for her work as a whole.         Her 1958 marriage to Guy Schoeller, a publisher, ended in divorce in 1960. Her 1962 marriage to Robert James Westhoff, an American ceramicist and sculptor, ended in divorce in 1963.         Her survivors include a son, Denis, from her marriage to Mr. Westhoff.         Ms. Sagan's views on romance could be somber. In a 1980 interview, she said: ''I think love is like an illness, an intoxication. Sometimes I've been intoxicated for three or four years, but never more. I think that people can be happy together for longer than I used to believe, but I still don't think it can be forever.''         In a 1993 interview before her second drug trial, Ms. Sagan recalled: ''I had incredible luck because just when I grew up, the pill came along. When I was 18, I used to die with fear of being pregnant, but then it arrived, and love was free and without consequence for nearly 30 years. Then AIDS came. Those 30 years coincided with my adulthood, the age for having fun.''       
         Virginia Hamilton Adair, a California poet who published her first collection, ''Ants on the Melon,'' when she was 83, died on Thursday in Claremont, Calif., her daughter, Katharine Adair Waugh, said. She was 91 and lived in Claremont.         Published by Random House in 1996, ''Ants on the Melon'' received wide attention, partly because of Ms. Adair's personal story (a retired English professor, by then blind from glaucoma, she had written poetry all her life but had published little since the 1940's) and partly for the unaffected style and universal themes of her work.         The collection sold more than 28,000 copies, which her editor, Daniel Menaker, yesterday called an ''alpine'' figure for a volume of poetry.         Reviewing ''Ants on the Melon'' in The New York Times Book Review, Brad Leithauser wrote, ''Given how much darkness the book contains -- meditations on the atom bomb, her husband's death, a drowned girl, the literal dark of blindness -- it casts a surprisingly bright afterglow.''         In the poem ''Break-In,'' Ms. Adair wrote:         Hearing the footsteps of thieves         in the dark downstairs:         what are you looking for?         it has already been stolen         over and over. . . .         Mary Virginia Hamilton was born in the Bronx on Feb. 28, 1913, and was raised in Montclair, N.J. She disliked the name Mary and dropped it as soon as she left home. She grew up surrounded by poetry. Her father, Robert Browning Hamilton, was a serious amateur poet, and one of her earliest memories was of him reading Alexander Pope's ''Iliad'' to her in her crib. She began writing her own poems when she was 6.         Ms. Adair held a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke College and a master's from Radcliffe and was a professor at California Polytechnic University in Pomona for many years. In 1936, she married Douglass Adair, who became a prominent historian. Mr. Adair committed suicide in 1968.         In the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Adair published poems in The Saturday Review, The Atlantic and The New Republic. Though she continued to write almost daily, the demands of motherhood, and later of an academic career, plus her distaste for the gamesmanship of the publishing world, caused her to send out little work for the next half-century.         In the late 1980's, a friend, the poet Robert Mezey, encouraged Ms. Adair to put together a manuscript of her best work. Some years later, without her knowledge, he sent a copy to Alice Quinn, the New Yorker's poetry editor. Ms. Quinn published several of the poems, along with a rapturous essay on Ms. Adair, in the magazine's 1995 year-end double issue. After that, Ms. Adair's work appeared regularly in The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books. Though some critics were cautious (Jonathan Galassi called her ''a serious poet without being an earth-shatteringly original one''), others praised it lavishly. The poet Galway Kinnell told The New Yorker, ''She has arrived in our world like a comet.''         In addition to her daughter, of New Paltz, N.Y., Ms. Adair is survived by two sons, Robert, of Pomona, and Douglass, of Thermal, Calif.; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Terry Dintenfass, a longtime New York art dealer whose gallery brought together several currents from outside the mainstream of 20th-century art, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         Her death was reported by her son Andrew Dintenfass.         For nearly 40 years the Terry Dintenfass gallery swam mostly against the tide of the rest of the art world. In the era of Pop and Minimal Art, Ms. Dintenfass was drawn to politically aware figurative painting rooted in the Social Realism of the 1930's.         She also represented the estates of first-generation American modernists like Arthur Dove and Charles Sheeler, as well as that of Ben Shahn.         At a time when nearly all artists showing in New York galleries were white, she represented several black artists, most notably Jacob Lawrence, but also Raymond Saunders, Richard Hunt and Walter Williams, a little-known painter whose work she showed in her first gallery, which was in Atlantic City.         She also represented the estate of Horace Pippin, a black folk artist, and worked on an important traveling exhibition of his work in 1977 that was organized by the Phillips Collection in Washington.         And, even though the line separating high and low culture was fairly firm, she also exhibited artists with a strong illustrational bent, like Ronald Markman, Richard Merkin and Robert Andrew Parker, as well as Edward Koren, a cartoonist for The New Yorker.         Ms. Dintenfass's life was an unusual mixture of propriety, activism and bohemianism. Born Theresa Kline on Easter in 1920, she grew up in Atlantic City, where her family owned a small department store.         She and her brother, Nathan S. Kline (author of ''From Sad to Glad,'' about depression), lived in a house full of art, books and music, with parents who wanted their children to be aware of people different from themselves.         Ms. Dintenfass attended finishing school in Virginia and studied art on and off for years, mostly at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art in Philadelphia. In 1938 she married a surgeon, Arthur Dintenfass, and had three children; after World War II they settled in Atlantic City, where she ran her husband's medical office for several years.         Using a small trust fund, Ms. Dintenfass began buying one painting every year, often from the Whitney Museum of American Art's annual exhibitions of painting and sculpture.         Her first galleries, called D Contemporary Gallery, were in Atlantic City hotels. She showed work on consignment from prominent New York dealers, and became especially close to Edith Gregor Halpert, whose Downtown Gallery represented several artists from the Alfred Stieglitz circle. She also sold the work of Milton Avery.         In 1959 she opened a gallery in a garden apartment at 18 East 67th Street in Manhattan, where she also lived for several years. In 1975 she moved her gallery to a large space in Manhattan, at 50 West 57th Street, and retired in 1999. Her business is now run by her son Andrew.         Ms. Dintenfass's first marriage and a brief second one ended in divorce. In 1976 she married James M. Reed, a career diplomat who also worked for the American Friends Service Committee. Mr. Reed died in 1985. In addition to Andrew, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., Ms. Dintenfass is survived by two other children from her first marriage, Dr. John Dintenfass of Manhattan and Susan Subtle Dintenfass of Berkeley, Calif.; and three grandchildren.       
         Lynn Manulis, a retailer of luxury fashion who dressed a generation of the world's most socially prominent women in classic style while attiring their daughters in the work of bold young designers whose reputations she helped make, died on Sunday in Lantana, Fla.         She was 85. A resident of Lantana, she had lived in Palm Beach for many years. Ms. Manulis died after having been ill with lung cancer, her daughter, Nancy Glick, said.         Until her retirement last year, Ms. Manulis was president and chief executive of Martha Inc., the chain of boutiques founded by her mother, Martha Phillips. The flagship store, Martha, was on Park Avenue near 58th Street in Manhattan; there were also stores in Trump Tower and in Palm Beach and Bal Harbour, Fla.         Ms. Manulis (MAN-you-liss), whom almost everyone called Miss Lynn, and her mother, known as Miss Martha, were for decades ''the doyennes of haute couture in America,'' The New York Times wrote in 1992. Mrs. Phillips died in 1996 at 98.         While her mother dressed a constellation of boldface names in evening gowns by Halston, Geoffrey Beene, Pauline Trigère and Oscar de la Renta, Ms. Manulis sought to attract younger clients. In 1989, she opened a shop, Martha International, where she showcased the work of emerging talents like Zang Toi, Charlotte Neuville, Gemma Kahng and Christian Francis Roth.         Among the garments there, The Times reported, were ''a strapless cotton dress with an appliquéd shark curving around the body, a sequined race driver's jacket studded with sports-car emblems'' and ''an orange blanket coat dripping giant fringes.''         Lynn Phillips was born on Dec. 28, 1918, in Brooklyn. She studied acting with Stella Adler, and in 1942 appeared in the play ''Angel Street.'' In 1944, she married Robert Burnstine; the couple were divorced in 1954.         After her divorce, Ms. Manulis joined her mother's business; she married Fred Manulis, a physician, in 1960. Dr. Manulis died in 1989. She is survived by two children from her first marriage, her daughter, of Washington, and a son, Andrew Burnstine, of Plantation, Fla.         Martha Inc. thrived in the 1980's, with sales of more than $40 million in 1987, The Times reported. But the stock market crash of 1987 and the recession that followed put an end to the demand for the kind of goods that made the names of Ms. Manulis and her mother. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1992, closing its five stores.         ''I was selling original couture dresses -- $20,000, $30,000 -- and nobody asked me the price,'' Ms. Manulis recalled in 1996. ''In the blink of an eye everyone pulled back.''         In 1995, mother and daughter opened Martha Phillips, which sold less-expensive clothing, in Palm Beach. That store closed last year.       
         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Henny Backus, the widow of the comic actor Jim Backus and an actress and author of wit and verve, died on Dec. 9 in Los Angeles, her longtime home. She was 93.         She died after a series of strokes, said a friend, Doris Bacon.         Mrs. Backus, a leggy redhead with a droll sense of humor, started her career as a showgirl in the Broadway revues of the 1920's.         Later she took on character parts in television sitcoms like ''Blondie,'' in which she played the matronly Cora Dithers opposite her husband, who played Dagwood's irascible boss, Mr. Dithers.         Together Henny and Jim Backus wrote several blithe books about their marriage, including ''What Are You Doing After the Orgy?'' (1962), ''Backus Strikes Back'' (1984) and ''Forgive Us Our Digressions'' (1988).         According to one of their books, ''Only When I Laugh'' (1965), it was Mrs. Backus who persuaded Jim to use the upper-crust drawl that eventually landed him the part of the millionaire Thurston Howell III on ''Gilligan's Island.''         ''Any Harvard man I ever went out with sounded like that,'' she explained, ''like he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and they forgot to take it out.''         Henrietta Kaye, who later went by Henriette, was born in Brooklyn on March 21, 1911, and studied art at Cooper Union.         Though her sculptures sold well, she preferred acting and would linger outside stage doors hoping to be hired. She appeared in several musicals and during the Depression she joined an acting troupe sponsored by the federal Works Progress Administration.         She married Mr. Backus in 1943 and became his caretaker 35 years later, after he developed Parkinson's disease. She described what she learned in ''Care for the Caretaker,'' an advice book published in 1999.         She is survived by a sister, Florence Gittleman of Manhattan, and a brother, Irving A. Kaye of Boca Raton, Fla. Her previous marriage, to Nat Karson, ended in divorce.
