         Zilla Lippmann, a philanthropist and past president of New Dramatists, a Manhattan-based theatrical organization that helps playwrights develop new works, died on Dec. 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         Mrs. Lippmann, a niece of the Broadway producer John Golden, first worked in his office as a script evaluator and, eventually, producing associate. She was a founder and president of the John Golden Fund, a foundation devoted to the support of American plays and playwriting. She also played a major role in founding New Dramatists in 1949, served for many years on its board and was its president in the early 1980's.         The John Golden Fund later helped New Dramatists buy its headquarters at 242 West 44th Street, and Mrs. Lippmann instigated the creation of dormitory space in the building for visiting playwrights.         In the 1980's Mrs. Lippmann developed the New Dramatists' international playwright exchange program, which was renamed the Brooks Atkinson Memorial Playwright Exchange in honor of the former theater critic of The New York Times. The program is currently underwritten by the New York Times Company Foundation.         Mrs. Lippmann was also on the board of the Museum of the City of New York and helped found and develop its theater collection.         Born Zilla Hymes in New York, Mrs. Lippmann studied biology at Vassar College and graduated from Cooper Union with a degree in chemical engineering. She married Alfred Lippmann, an advertising executive, in 1929.         She is survived by a daughter, Jill Allgauer of Munich, and three grandchildren.       
         Hedy Lamarr, the raven-haired Viennese beauty who became one of the reigning temptresses in Hollywood films in the 1930's and 40's, especially as Delilah vamping Victor Mature's Samson, was found dead in her home in Orlando, Fla., yesterday. She was 86.         Miss Lamarr was forever identified with ''Ecstasy,'' a 1933 Czech film in which she appeared nude in a swimming scene and in a lovemaking sequence that was torrid for its time. The film was banned in many places in the United States for a number of years. But even though most Americans never saw it, ''Ecstasy'' excited their interest in the actress and shaped her career.         But as David Thomson, the film historian, said of her work in the United States: ''It became her lot to be cast as exotic, sultry women -- and she did her best; but conscientiousness is not quite what we expect in our femme fatales. Too often, she had a worried look.''         Miss Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler in Vienna, the daughter of a well-to-do banker and a concert pianist. She studied acting with Max Reinhardt in Vienna in 1931. He watched her read her lines one day and declared that she was either ''the most beautiful girl in the world'' or ''the most beautiful girl in Europe.'' (Press reports at the time carried both versions.)         She appeared in a few films before ''Ecstasy,'' a mostly silent film that was well received in Europe, where it was released as ''Symphonie der Liebe.'' Pope Pius XI  denounced it, but Mussolini issued a permit so that it could be shown at the Venice Film Festival. It won no awards there but attracted attentive audiences, most of them men.         By the time ''Ecstasy'' had begun to make the rounds in Europe, Miss Kiesler  was married to the first of her six husbands, Fritz Mandl, a Viennese munitions maker who was then in the process of making a tidy fortune by selling his wares to the Nazis. Mr. Mandl was upset by the film and spent a great sum of money tracking down and purchasing prints of ''Ecstasy'' so that nobody would see it. He explained that it was not so much because his wife could be seen nude, but because of the look on her face during the sex scenes.         Mr. Mandl came to regret all the money he spent buying the film. He didn't get all the prints. Then the Nazis seized his factory (he didn't pay his taxes, they claimed), and  Miss Kiesler left him (she thought he was dull) and made her way to London. There she got an acting job and was seen by Louis B. Mayer, who immediately offered her a contract to work for MGM, his Hollywood studio. Mr. Mayer changed her name to Lamarr after a silent film star named Barbara La Marr, whom he admired.         ''Ecstasy'' arrived in the United States in 1934 and was promptly banned in New York.  It was the subject of numerous court tests in the 1930's.         When the star of ''Ecstasy'' arrived in New York on the liner Normandie in 1937, she was mindful that ''Ecstasy'' had arrived before her and was determined to have audiences believe she was more than just a pretty face. She refused to display her knees for the photographers from the New York dailies who met the ship (her skirt reached her ankles), and she asked them not to refer to her as Hedy Kiesler anymore. ''Please call me Hedy Lamarr,'' she said.         In 1938 she made her first American film, ''Algiers,'' with Charles Boyer, with the result that undergraduates at Columbia voted her the girl with whom they would most like to be marooned on a desert island. She became popular; men fantasized about her, and women began to wear their hair as she did, parted down the middle.         But Miss Lamarr never achieved the stardom of some of her fellow emigrees -- Greta Garbo, Greer Garson or Marlene Dietrich -- all of whom won plaudits not just for their  sex appeal but also for their acting. The reviews of Miss Lamarr's films all emphasized her beauty, but when the scripts actually gave her something to say, the critics were not as passionate.         ''Now that she has inadvisedly been given an opportunity to act,'' wrote Bosley Crowther, reviewing ''Lady of the Tropics'' for The New York Times in 1939, ''it is necessary to report that she is essentially one of those museum pieces, like the Mona Lisa, who were more beautiful in repose.''         When she played a seductress enchanting  British plantation owners in Africa in ''White Cargo'' in 1942, Miss Lamarr purred, ''I am Tondelayo.'' This became grist for comedians; Jack Benny made  many jokes on the radio about an imaginary salesgirl named Tondelayo Schwartzkopf.         In another of her best-known roles, she gave Victor Mature the ultimate haircut in  ''Samson and Delilah,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 epic. DeMille, who never overlooked the box-office potential of sexy women in the Bible and the actresses who played them, had a clinging gown made for her out of feathers from prize peacocks he kept.         Among Miss Lamarr's other films were  ''Comrade X'' (1940) with Clark Gable, for King Vidor; ''Boom Town'' (also 1940), in which she seduced Gable. She also appeared as a showgirl with Judy Garland and Lana Turner in ''Ziegfeld Girl'' (1941), and with Spencer Tracy and John Garfield in ''Tortilla Flat'' (1942). She was considered difficult to please and was said to have turned down memorable parts that went to Gene Tierney (''Laura'') and Ingrid Bergman (''Casablanca'' and ''Gaslight.'') After her appearance in ''Samson and Delilah'' she went on to display her perfect profile in such films as ''Copper Canyon'' (1950), ''A Lady Without Passport'' (1950), the comedy ''My Favorite Spy'' (1951) and ''The Story of Mankind'' (1957) as her career faded .         Her private life was messy and sad.         In early 1939, she met Gene Markey, a writer and producer in Hollywood, and they  eloped to Mexico. She divorced Mr. Markey the following year, complaining to a judge that they had been married for 14 months and that in all that time, he had spent only four evenings alone with her. The judge granted the divorce, but suggested that if she ever contemplated a future marriage, she should spend more than a month getting to know her man.         After her divorce from Mr. Markey, Miss Lamarr went to a Hollywood dinner party at the home of Janet Gaynor and there met George Antheil, the composer. Miss Lamarr and Antheil got to talking about the war and how tough it was going to be to stop the Nazis.         As the story goes, Miss Lamarr recalled hearing some conversations that had occurred between her first husband, Mr. Mandl, and the Nazis, who seemed to place great value on creating some sort of device that would permit the radio control of airborne torpedoes and reduce the danger of jamming. She and Antheil got to discussing all this. The idea, they decided, was to defeat jamming efforts by sending synchronized radio signals on various wavelengths to missiles, which could then be directed to hit their mark.         Antheil supplied the technical expertise for the concept and on Aug. 11, 1942, the two received a United States patent for the use of radio-controlled missiles that could be used against the Germans. There were some doubts that Miss Lamarr had the technical background to give much to the project, but Antheil always credited her. The government was not initially interested in their device, but a refined version of it was used by the American military in the 1960's -- after the patent had expired. They never made a dime. In 1996 they were honored for their work by a professional engineering society. ''It's about time,'' was Miss Lamarr's only comment.         In 1941 Miss Lamarr was briefly engaged to the actor George Montgomery. She continued to make movies and worked hard to sell millions of dollars in war bonds. She told an audience in Philadelphia that she was just ''a gold digger for Uncle Sam.'' In the spring of 1943 she married the British actor John Loder. She knew him six months before she married him. They were divorced three years later.         Miss Lamarr's other marriages -- to Teddy Stauffer, a former band leader who ran a nightclub in Acapulco, Mexico; Howard Lee, a Texas oilman; and Lewis W. Boles, a West Coast lawyer -- all ended in divorce.         She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Denise; they all survive her.         Early in her career, a certain litigiousness manifested itself and continued to dog her existence. In 1943 she sued Loew's and MGM because they failed to pay her a contractual $2,000 a week. They said they were unable to pay her what they owed because President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had issued a wartime executive order limiting all salaries to $25,000 a year. The case was settled out of court.         Over the years, she was involved in several other lawsuits that did not work out so well. Among them was one against a Los Angeles department store that had accused her of shoplifting. (She was acquitted of the charge, and her own lawsuit against the store was dismissed.)         Best known of her lawsuits was one directed in the 1960's and 70's against the publisher and ghostwriter of ''Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman,'' an autobiography that was intended to revive her notoriety as a sex goddess. She said the book was ''deliberately written as an obscene, shocking, scandalous, naughty, wanton, fleshy, sensual, lecherous, lustful and scarlet version'' of her life. Her suit failed.         In 1991, living sparingly in South Florida, she was again accused of shoplifting ($21 worth of personal-care items from a drug store) but not prosecuted. In recent years, Miss Lamarr lived quietly in a suburb of Orlando. Friends said she was legally blind and did not venture out on her own.         ''What happened to me?,'' Miss Lamarr  asked the syndicated columnist Sheilah  Graham in 1966. ''I made $7 million and yet I was on relief and they gave me all of $48 a week.''         ''I'm not so crazy about acting,'' she told Miss Graham. ''All that makeup and getting up so early. Maybe I'll go to Europe. Oh, they want me. I have many offers.''       
         Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the 20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil, died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Wednesday. She was 101 and lived in Seattle.         Since the early 1960's Ms. Wolf was a leader in the Audubon Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its newsletter until her death.         Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who profiled her in his 1995 book ''Coming of Age,'' that she intended to live until the year 2000. ''Then I'm going,'' she said.         Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes, recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.         But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues, peace, feminism and immigration.         Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter, finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.         She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies, unemployment aid and social security.         Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later, was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to evict a family. ''I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ''As the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in despair and frustration.''         Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not clear who was working for whom.         The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ''The foreign born were the earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years ago in a talk to a high school class. ''They still have a hard and uncertain life.''         In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ''What a wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.         ''I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.         But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at members.tripod.com/HazelWolf). Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the Western Outdoor Clubs.         ''One of her major causes was always for labor to join with environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups in their movement.         ''People gang up to protect all kinds of things -- civil liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ''It's in our genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''         Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration Lawyers Association last year, ''We lost most of the battles but we won the war in all of them.''         She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate with friends. ''I proposed the following toast: 'To hell with Queen Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.' ''         She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles, five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in divorce.         Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early 1960's. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the earth with a silent spring with no song birds, but more than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching (specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods) that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon. For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.         But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest, she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to do so: the fish are ''good to eat.''         And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ''spare that tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes, furniture, paper and ''probably even skateboards.''       
         Jeanne Simon, the wife of former Senator Paul Simon who forged her own public career as a prosecutor, lawmaker and lobbyist for literacy and libraries, died on Sunday at their home in Makanda, Ill. She was 77.         Mrs. Simon had undergone surgery for the removal of a malignant brain tumor in September. At the time, her surgeons said the operation had succeeded, but they left open the long-term prognosis.         When her husband, an Illinois Democrat, left the Senate in 1997, Mrs. Simon joined him on the faculty of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale as an adjunct professor of library affairs. She helped him found and shape the agenda of the Public Policy Institute at the university.         In 1993 Mrs. Simon was named chairwoman of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, a post to which President Clinton reappointed her in 1997. In that position she promoted literacy programs and financing for libraries.         Born in Chicago, Jeanne Hurley graduated from Barat College in Lake Forest, Ill., and from Northwestern University Law School. She served as an assistant state's attorney for Cook County and was one of a few women in the Illinois Legislature when she met her husband, then a fellow lawmaker.         They were married in 1960 and teamed for several of his political campaigns, including the senator's 1988 stab at the Democratic presidential nomination.         She chronicled her experiences on the stump in a well-received memoir, ''Codename Scarlett -- Life on the Campaign Trail by the Wife of a Presidential Candidate.''         Besides her husband, Mrs. Simon is survived by a daughter, Sheila Simon of Carbondale; a son, Martin, of Crofton, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Filomen D'Agostino Greenberg, a self-taught stock trader who used her good fortune to help her alma mater, New York University Law School, grow into an academic leader, died Friday. She was 101 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Arriving from Coney Island one morning in 1917 to start classes, Fil D'Agostino -- as she was called by friends -- found five small rooms crammed into a single building east of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. Fresh out of high school, she got a $3-a-week clerk's job and received her law degree in 1920.         While she was practicing negligence and criminal law, she married Max Greenberg, a 1919 New York University law graduate who became a highly successful expert in contract law; he died in 1980.         In World War II, Mrs. Greenberg worked as a government censor. One day she came across a letter filled with arcane abbreviations and fractions that read like code. She realized that she was looking at stock-market quotations. Her interest piqued, she reached for the daily paper, and a new carer opened up.         Since her husband showed no interest in the market, she pursued it on her own, but they both began many years of strong financial support for the law school. She continued her investments, and her donations, after her husband's death.         By 1990, her gifts totaled more than $6 million, which made her the school's biggest benefactor at the time. Her help made possible the Filomen D'Agostino Residence Hall for about 370 students; its inspiration was her difficult trip back and forth from Brooklyn every day when she was a student. Her help also financed the Greenberg Lounge on the campus, the Greenberg Faculty Research Fund and the Greenberg Professorship in Contract Law.         She is survived by a sister, Deborah Johnston.         Law, Mrs. Greenberg once said, was not her first career choice. ''I wanted to study medicine,'' she said, ''but no school in New York would admit a woman, and my family was too poor to send me away to study.''       
         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral, chamber and vocal music, died on Monday at the Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was 86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years. Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980's her shorter works were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.         Ms. Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.         In the mid-1930's Ms. Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ''The Race of Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ''Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles Weidman and ''Tragic Exodus'' and ''They Too Are Exiles'' (both 1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ''Alcestis'' (1960) for Graham and ''My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.         Ms. Fine's symphonic works include ''Elegiac Song'' for muted strings (1937) and ''Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano, baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).         As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from 1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of her operas, ''The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings. Her last major work, ''The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and Ruth Crawford Seeger.         Still, Ms. Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by their sex. ''I hope the term 'woman composer' will be dropped soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989. ''I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk of 'poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists -- singers, pianists, violinists -- have been accepted for a long time.''         Ms. Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and Bennington College in Vermont.         She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of North Bennington, Vt.         Correction:  March 28, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the composer Vivian Fine on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her husband, Benjamin Karp of Hoosick Falls, N.Y.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Janet Reed, whose comic gifts and sparkling technique made her one of American dance's most beloved ballerinas in the early years of American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, died in Seattle last Monday. She was 83 and lived in Seattle.         She suffered a stroke one week earlier, said Maren Erskine, her daughter-in-law.         A petite redhead whose vivacious energy delighted audiences in both story ballets and pure-dance works, Ms. Reed was San Francisco Ballet's leading ballerina from 1937 to 1941 before joining Ballet Theater in 1942 and City Ballet in 1949.         She was a member of Eugene Loring's experimental chamber company, Dance Players, in 1942. In 1974 she helped found the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, remaining for two years as its first artistic director.         A member of the original cast of Jerome Robbins's first ballet, ''Fancy Free,'' Ms. Reed became associated with a memorable role and the kind of all-American image that audiences identified with her dancing. When Robbins created ''Fancy Free'' for Ballet Theater in 1944 he cast her as the young woman who dances a romantic duet with a sailor in a bar during World War II and then wipes her lipstick off his face.         By then Ms. Reed had also performed the ballerina roles in the 19th-century classics in San Francisco. These included Willam Christensen's 1940 staging of ''Swan Lake,'' the ballet's first full-length American production. As Lincoln Kirstein noted in his book ''Movement and Metaphor,'' Ms. Reed was an excellent comedian but also a classical dancer.         Kirstein and George Balanchine founded City Ballet in 1948 and Balanchine invited Ms. Reed into the company a few months later. He quickly cast her in his signature Neo-Classical ballets, including ''Symphony in C'' and ''Serenade.''         In 1949 he choreographed ''Bourree Fantasque,'' whose final exuberant section exploited the vitality and virtuosity that made up Ms. Reed's trademark style.         In the 1940's and 50's City Ballet was a very different company than it is today. Balanchine continued to develop a plotless Neo-Classical genre, but the repertory was eclectic, drawing upon a variety of choreographers. Robbins, like Ms. Reed, had transferred from Ballet Theater and become associate artistic director in 1949. Ms. Reed had danced in the 1945 premiere of ''Interplay,'' Robbins's enduring mix of bravura and blues, and he continued to use her.         Comic ballets, even by Balanchine, were not a rarity at City Ballet and in this realm Ms. Reed was queen. In Balanchine's ''A la Francaix,'' Ms. Reed was a belle who lost her swain, Andre Eglevsky, to a sylph, Maria Tallchief. In ''The Pied Piper,'' by Robbins, Ms. Reed led a jiving pack after a clarinetist onstage. She was the droopy Hortense, queen of the Waterlilies in Ruthanna Boris's ''Cakewalk,'' a comic gloss on minstrel shows.         In City Ballet's 1953 revival of Lew Christensen's ''Filling Station,'' a bit of 1938 Americana, Ms. Reed danced opposite the young Jacques d'Amboise as a gas station attendant. She was in her element as a tipsy debutante. When Balanchine created ''Western Symphony'' Ms. Reed made his satire of a classical adagio a lesson in strong technique and projection.         John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, devoted an article to Ms. Reed in 1954: ''Janet Reed is adorable, all right, and that unquestionably brings a great many customers to the box office; but she is also an artist of very high attainments, and a performer among performers.''         Ms. Reed was born in Tolo, Ore., and studied ballet with Willam Christensen in Portland, Ore., and San Francisco.         Although repeatedly praised for her comic timing and engaging characterization, Ms. Reed had an extensive dramatic range that she displayed in Antony Tudor's psychological ballets and Michael Kidd's ''On Stage!'' at Ballet Theater.         After marrying Branson Erskine, an interior designer, she appeared in the Robbins musical ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing'' in 1947. She is survived by a son, Reed Erskine of New York, and a daughter, Jane Erskine of Seattle.         Ms. Reed returned to Ballet Theater briefly before joining City Ballet, where she danced until 1958 and then was its ballet mistress until 1961. She taught in several colleges before moving to Seattle, where she also staged dances for the Seattle Opera. In 1983 she and Gene Kelly were the hosts of a gala celebrating the San Francisco Ballet's 50th anniversary.       
         Gertrude Sanford Legendre, an unlikely debutante of the 1920's who forsook society to become a big-game hunter and then to work during World War II for the Office of Strategic Services, predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, died on Wednesday at Medway, her historic lantation near Charleston, S.C. She was 97 and also had a home on Fishers Island, off Long Island.         Gertrude Sanford was in her teens when she took a hunting trip to the Grand Tetons of Wyoming and shot her first elk. For years, she pursued big game in Africa, India, Iran and Indochina, and contributed rare specimens to museums.         In her later years, she established the Medway Environmental Trust for educational purposes and to ensure that Medway would forever be managed as a nature preserve.         Mrs. Legendre began her wartime career as a secretary with the O.S.S. in Washington. In 1944, the agency transferred her to Paris and gave her a WAC uniform and paperwork identifying her as a second lieutenant.         She became the first American woman captured in France when, on a visit to the front northeast of Paris, she found herself pinned down by German sniper fire. Held as a prisoner of war for six months, she escaped and went by train to Switzerland. The train stopped short of the border; as she dashed to the frontier, a German guard ordered her to halt or be shot. She continued, and reached the border.         After the war, Mrs. Legendre helped a German prison guard who had been kind to her emigrate to the United States. She established the Medway Plan to provide medical help to countries devastated by the war.         Mrs. Legendre was born in 1902 in Aiken, S.C., the youngest of three children of John and Ethel Sanford. She, her brother, Stephen Sanford, an internationally recognized polo player known as Laddie, and her sister, Sara Jane Sanford, were said to have been the inspiration for Philip Barry's 1929 play ''Holiday,'' made into a classic movie starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. She wrote two autobiographies, ''The Sands Ceased to Run'' (1947) and ''The Time of My Life'' (1987).         Mrs. Legendre was reared in Amsterdam, N.Y., and in a Manhattan town house on East 72nd Street now occupied by the Lycee Francais. She was educated at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., and made her debut after her graduation in 1920.  She and Sidney J. Legendre married in 1929. He died in 1948.         Mrs. Legendre is survived by two daughters, Bokara Legendre of Manhattan and Mill Valley, Calif., and Landine Manigault of Stonington, Conn.; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         Known as one of the grand dames of Charleston, Mrs. Legendre gave a New Year's Eve costume party that was a tradition for half a century. At one of the last of those parties, she offered a toast: ''I look ahead. I always have. I don't contemplate life, I live it. And I'm having the time of my life.''       
         Lucia Dlugoszewski, a composer and the artistic director of the Erick Hawkins Dance Company, was found dead on Tuesday in her Greenwich Village apartment. According to music reference sources she was 68.         She died of natural causes, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner.         Ms. Dlugoszewski was a prominent contemporary composer in her own right but also created scores for many signature works by Hawkins, to whom she was married. She assumed direction of his modern-dance company in 1996, two years after his death.         She made her formal debut as a choreographer last year in a program presented by the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Project, which is sponsoring a program of her choreography performed by the Hawkins company at the 91st Street Playhouse in Manhattan through Sunday afternoon. ''The company will live on, and Erick and Lucy will live on with us,'' Louis Kavouras, a dancer, rehearsal director and company archivist, said yesterday.         Ms. Dlugoszewski was celebrated in New York dance for her unparalleled gift for inspiring intense affection, admiration and exasperation all at once as she exuberantly buttonholed countless company directors, choreographers, dancers and writers to involve them in her own and Hawkins's projects. Beneath that hectic, usually disheveled exterior, however, was a poetic, gutsy composer known for her experimentation with timbre or tonal quality and color, her invention of percussion instruments and the freshness of her musical structures, in works made for the timbre piano and traditional orchestra instruments. She created, Virgil Thomson once said, ''far-out music of great delicacy, originality and beauty of sound.''         Born in Detroit, Ms. Dlugoszewski studied physics at Wayne State University before moving in the late 1940's to New York City, where she studied piano with Grete Sultan, music analysis with Felix Salzer and composition with Varese. Around 1951 she developed the timbre piano, a conventional piano whose strings are struck with beaters and played with a variety of bows and plectra, or pieces of wood, metal and ivory. She later created percussion and friction instruments, constructed by the sculptor Ralph Dorazio, for musicians performing for Hawkins.         Soon after her arrival in New York, she was taken up by painters and poets in the New York School, among them Robert Motherwell, John Ashbery and Ad Reinhardt. Her first concert in New York, in 1957, was sponsored by the artists David Smith and Herman Cherry. Her first reviewer was Frank O'Hara. Recognition from musicians came with the orchestral works she composed in the 1970's.         Her music has been performed by the New York Philharmonic, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Louisville Orchestra, the Seattle Symphony and the American Composers Orchestra.         Ms. Dlugoszewski was the first woman to win the Koussevitzky International Recording Award, in 1977, and has also been honored by the National Institute of Arts and Letters.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an aging French prostitute in screen and stage versions of ''Zorba the Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.         Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not reported by news agencies.         Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England, Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a French Cesar for the film ''Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for ''Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in Sicily for the film ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Ms. Kedrova was best known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ''Zorba.''         In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony Quinn, Miss Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying mistress.         ''The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.         When she recreated her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of The Times described Ms. Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ''a small, round, smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat ''her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing flirtatiousness.''         He said: ''Miss Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see the young 'cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we do. No wonder Miss Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''         The role that won Miss Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone Signoret.         But, Miss Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Miss Signoret withdrew, and Mr. Cacoyannis telephoned Ms. Kedrova in Paris to invite her to join his cast.         ''I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she told The Times of London some years ago. ''It was a fascinating role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win the Academy Award.''         There was one other problem, Miss Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Mr. Cacoyannis called, he asked if Miss Kedrova spoke English.         ''He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ''And I replied, 'Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''         But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung and expressions like ''How do you do?'' and ''Thank you,'' she got the part.         Miss Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.         A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ''Once I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ''When I was 12, I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do. And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris, who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them for three years.         ''In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''         So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who became her first husband.         In the early 1950's she began to achieve critical and popular success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like ''The Rose Tattoo,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''A Taste of Honey'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov.''         Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married in 1969, said that Miss Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors, made her last stage appearance in the early 1990's at the Chichester Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.         Some reference books listed Miss Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and Mr. Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left their papers behind. And the false papers they were given in France were confiscated by the Nazis.         ''She liked it that way,'' Mr. Howard said of her agelessness. ''I remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be 16.''       
         Micheline Glover, who as an 18-year-old girl worked for the French Resistance during World War II, delivering secret messages under the eyes of unwitting German soldiers, died April 15 in White Plains Hospital in White Plains, N.Y. She was 76.         Mrs. Glover, who was born in Paris, received a citation after the war from Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for one of her activities in the Resistance: rescuing Allied airmen shot down by the Nazis.         She recalled in a privately published memoir that she was first drawn to the Resistance -- the clandestine underground that sought to disrupt the German occupation of France -- when at age 16 she joined a student protest march in Paris. German troops fired on the students with machine guns, killing several.         Two years later, after Mrs. Glover had moved with her family to Montlucon, she discovered that her English tutor was in the Resistance, and she asked him whether she could do something ''to help our cause.''         Soon Mrs. Glover became a courier for Pierre Kaan, a philosophy professor who was a major figure in the Resistance. Professor Kaan, who was Jewish, was eventually captured and killed in a Nazi death camp.         Mrs. Glover's first assignments were riding trains throughout the country, carrying secret messages taped to her back. In this work, she seems to have had nerves of steel.         Once, the train in which she was riding came to a sudden halt. She and the other passengers were told to leave the train to have their identification papers checked. Mrs. Glover's papers were found to be unacceptable, and she was instructed to stand aside while other passengers were checked and questioned. She followed orders, but when the passengers with acceptable identification papers were told to return to the train, Mrs. Glover slipped away from her forgetful guard and quietly boarded the train as it pulled out of the station.         On one occasion, she recalled in her memoir, she sat in a cafe filled with German soldiers and passed messages to her contact, sipping a glass of wine.         Another time, in still another cafe filled with enemy soldiers, her contact whispered a desperate request to her to help him repair the package he was carrying. She did his bidding, but not without first discovering that the package contained a deflated rubber raft destined for some secret mission.         A more elaborate and perhaps even more dangerous mission involved photographing the damage sustained by a large tire factory that had been bombed by American aircraft.         She could not afford to be caught prowling a factory that produced strategic war materials, but in the rubble she came upon two American airmen who had been shot down in the attack. Somehow, she would have to spirit them out of the country. She procured a couple of bicycles for the airmen to ride by night, only to discover that neither knew how to ride a bicycle.         ''I was very glad we did not meet any German patrols on our way,'' she wrote.         One of the airmen was later killed; the other escaped.         Mrs. Glover finished the war as an interpreter and was awarded a medal of honor from the French government.         She met her husband, Garlan Glover, at a Red Cross dance in Paris. The couple married and moved to White Plains in 1955. Mrs. Glover then devoted herself to raising a family.         Micheline Blum-Picard was born in Paris, the daughter of a French government official. She attended school in Montlucon.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Glover is survived by a daughter, Christiane, of Ossining, N.Y.; four sons, Derek of Ridgefield, Conn., Brian of White Plains, Renny of Boulder, Colo., and Wayne of North White Plains; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Glover recalled that in her Resistance work, after she received word that Allied forces were about to land on the Normandy coast, she asked to take part in the fighting. Her superiors decided that she could not be allowed to serve as a combat soldier, but rather as a nurse.         Nevertheless, she got her way. Even as a nurse, she was permitted to carry a rifle, a pistol and a hand grenade. She recalled that she fired repeatedly once the landings began, but could not be certain whether she hit anyone.       
         Dina Abramowicz, the longtime librarian at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research whose firsthand and encyclopedic knowledge of the lost Yiddish world of Eastern Europe made her a treasured resource for hundreds of scholars and writers for more than half a century, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Abramowicz had a formidable memory, and not only for those who peopled her cherished birthplace, Vilna, Lithuania, the great center of Yiddish culture now known as Vilnius, where the YIVO collection originated.         Her mind was a mental card catalog for hundreds of rare and obscure books and historical materials in the dusty YIVO stacks. And she hunted them down for scholars like Irving Howe and novelists like Leon Uris as well as for thousands of ordinary people trying to research their family histories.         When George F. Kennan, the diplomat and historian, was looking for material one day on a 19th century convert to Christianity, she led him not only to the entry in the library's precious Russian-Jewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in Yiddish about Jewish apostates.         ''This is the sort of book that Dina knew off the top of her head,'' said Zachary Baker, who succeeded Ms. Abramowicz as YIVO's head librarian and now is curator of Judaica at Stanford University's library.         Her friend Esther Hautzig, a Manhattan book editor and writer who grew up in Vilna, said of her, ''No computer on earth can store the information she had in her brain because she lived through it.'' She remembers Ms. Abramowicz as the librarian who provided her with her first library card.         Almost daily, Ms. Abramowicz received inquiries from journalists and writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of Yiddish. They relied on Ms. Abramowicz as their authority for the transliterated spelling of words like bobe (grandmother) and yichus (pedigree).         Though less than five feet tall and dainty in an Old World way, Ms. Abramowicz could be flintlike in her insistence upon historical and linguistic accuracy. When a letter to The New York Times stated that the word ''Holocaust'' was first used in the Dec. 24, 1942, daily bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, she made sure to write a corrective letter. The agency's bulletin, she pointed out, used a term translatable as atrocities, not Holocaust, and the probable first use of Holocaust to refer to the mass slaughter of Jews was from the May 14, 1943, Polish daily Nowy Dzien, which used the Polish word for holocaust, calopalenie, to describe the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto.         Her life, sorrowful as parts of it were, had a striking symmetry, from Vilna to the New York home of the archives rescued from Vilna.         Vilna was fiercely loved by its Jewish inhabitants as the ''Jerusalem of Lithuania,'' a city of writers like Chaim Grade and Abraham Sutzkever. Ms. Abramowicz was the librarian first of Vilna's Jewish children's library and then, after the Nazis herded Jews into ghettos, of the ghetto library. When she came to New York in 1946, she soon went to work for the transplanted version of one of Vilna's most important institutions, the YIVO library, many of whose thousands of books and artifacts had been smuggled out by a ragtag band of slave laborers and partisans known as the paper brigade.         She was YIVO's head librarian for 25 years, until 1987; then in her late 70's, she was eased off to work as research librarian, a position she held until her death.         The daughter of teachers, Ms. Abramowicz was born in 1909, when Vilna was part of the czar's empire; it was to live under Polish, Lithuanian, German and Soviet Russian governments before she left. She grew up speaking Russian, but when the Germans occupied Vilna during World War I, they allowed Jews to start their own schools, as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy, and Dina's parents sent her to Yiddish-language elementary and high schools.         After studying Polish literature in university, she went to work for her first library, the Kinderbibliotek. She also became a member of YIVO, the  acronym for the Yiddish name of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, an organization founded in 1925. It soon became a repository of manuscripts of Sholem Aleichem and Biaklik, records of Jewish communal governments and other historical documents as well as thousands of books.         When the Germans invaded in World War II and crammed Vilna's 56,000 Jews into neighborhood ghettos, Herman Kruk, a librarian, tried to maintain an oasis of normality in the madness by setting up a library, and he asked Ms. Abramowicz to staff it.         ''How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?'' she remembered asking a fellow librarian.         ''Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?'' was the answer she remembered getting.         In its first year, the library circulated 100,000 books to its starving, brutalized readers, mostly, it turned out, escapist fiction.         In September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated. Ms. Abramowicz's mother was dispatched to Treblinka, where she was killed; Ms. Abramowicz to a labor camp. By a stroke of fortune, the door on the cattle train opened on the Vilna platform and she simply walked off. She wound up in a less rigorous camp, one for workers who processed fur for the German army's winter coats. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper.         After the war, she found her father in New York, where he had traveled just before the war broke out in September 1939. She soon met Max Weinreich, a surviving YIVO founder, and joined him in reconstituting the YIVO collection in New York.         Beyond helping scholars who visited the Vanderbilt mansion that for years housed YIVO and its new home on West 16th Street, Ms. Abramowicz seemed to take on the search for roots as a personal compulsion.         ''At certain periods of your life, you start to want to find out what happened to your parents,'' she said once. ''I think it is the survival instinct of a people trying to find out who they are.''         Other than two nephews and a niece, Ms. Abramowicz left no survivors. But her name endures in dozens of acknowledgments by the authors whose research she shepherded. In his tribute in ''The World of Our Fathers,'' the classic work about the immigrant Jews of New York,  Mr. Howe thanked YIVO for making the book possible, ''especially its indefatigable and splendid librarian, Dina Abramowicz.''       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Judge Kathryn A. McDonald, who as administrator of the family court system of New York City was a champion of children's rights, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her  daughter, K. Ann McDonald.         Judge McDonald, a graduate of Columbia's law school, was named the administrative judge for the five New York City Family Court complexes in 1986. She had the title of administrative judge of the Family Court of New York City and retired from the post in 1995.         During her tenure, she tried to improve the courts despite an explosion in the number of cases, budget cuts and crumbling facilities. The courts faced other new problems in the 90's, as well. In 1995, with difficult custody decisions being complicated by AIDS, and by relatives who had taken in the children, grown to love them and become unwilling to give them up without a fight, Judge McDonald said: ''A lot of the custody cases in the last few years have been families fighting each other. It's an in-house thing. It's an awkward thing.''         In 1987, she said that largely because of drug addiction, more and more of the Family Court cases involved abused or neglected children, who had flooded the court system and in turn had overburdened the foster care system.         After receiving her law degree in 1963, she became a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society's juvenile rights division and then attorney-in-charge of Legal Aid's Manhattan office. In 1976, she became a Family Court judge. She was briefly supervising judge of the Family Court in New York County before becoming the administrative judge.         Before entering law school in 1960, she worked in personnel and labor relations for 20 years. But one afternoon, she and a friend watched proceedings in Family Court at time when poor children were not given assigned counsel. Recalling that experience in an interview in 1986, she said: ''The rich kids all had lawyers, and the poor kids had nobody. I decided that I wanted to become a lawyer and represent children.''         While she was the administrative judge, she also headed the New York Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts, which was established after a two-year study had found that ''gender bias against women litigants, attorneys and court employees is a pervasive problem.''         In that post she carried out recommendations intended to rid the state courts of sex bias.         With her in charge, the committee reported in 1987 that sensitivity training for judges and other programs had helped reduce such bias.         Kathryn Austin was born in Albany, grew up in Long Lake, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Cornell. She was married for six decades to Robert J. McDonald, who was a tax lawyer with the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. He died last year.         Besides her daughter, K. Ann McDonald of Manhattan, a litigation lawyer with the Manhattan law firm of Robinson Murphy & McDonald, Judge McDonald is survived by a brother, Malcolm Patrick Austin of Chicago.       
         Barbara Cartland, whose outpouring of more than 700 romance novels during seven decades made her the undisputed queen of a genre for hundreds of millions of readers the world over, died yesterday at her home near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, England. She was 98.         Throughout her professional life, Dame Barbara possessed a most uncommon ability: she was able to turn out 50,000-word novels at the rate of two a month. During the 1980's, when she was hardly young, she routinely produced 23 titles a year. With all of it she still managed to live the good life in Camfield Place, her gracious 400-acre estate in Hertfordshire,  with Twi-Twi, her Pekingese, and with her white Rolls-Royce ever at the ready, a pink mohair rug neatly folded in the back seat, there to keep guests comfortable when they were driven to her home from the station.         And although her name may not have been taken seriously by the more serious students of comparative literature or by the subscribers to literary supplements, about one billion copies of her 723 books were printed and sold in 36 languages.  Bantam and Jove Publications were among her several American publishers.         She has appeared in The Guinness Book of Records as the world's best-selling author, breaking records for 18 years.         In a century in which so many writers struggled against censorship laws for the right to describe a variety of sexual activities in explicit terms, Dame Barbara's prose remained dedicated to an unlikely celebration of the adventures of passionate virgins.         ''People don't roll around naked in my books,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I do allow them to go to bed if they're married, but it's all very wonderful and the moon beams.''         It was the way to sustain an approach to fiction writing that remained essentially unchanged from the early 1920's to the end of her days. She was totally convinced of its appropriateness. When it was suggested that she could be a tad more risque, she replied, ''You can't get more naked than naked, can you, and then where do you go from there?''         Her virgin heroines were typically fresh as April's peach blossoms. They were always wide-eyed, idealistic and impecunious, as demure as they were determined to struggle against all manner of vicissitudes in their quest to find Mr. Right.         He, in turn, was invariably a dark, square-jawed chap, perhaps with bulging biceps, incessantly given to splendid thoughts despite his worldliness. He was furthermore possessed of that indefinable magnetism that seems to surround men who have an enormous bankroll, a title and all the connections needed to keep good women out of harm's way forever.         Dame Barbara never asked anything of her heroines that she didn't ask of herself. Although twice married and the mother of three, she did not really like being kissed or touched, wrote a biographer with whom she cooperated, Gwen Robyns. ''It was part of the strange complex which meant she was a virgin not only physically but also mentally and spiritually,'' Ms. Robyns wrote in 1985.         The process by which a man and a woman found each other usually occurred in Regency, Victorian or Georgian times, and before they got to live happily ever after, her characters said things like, ''Oh, Miss, there is evil in this house,'' or, ''My son will never marry; I am his life.''         Her narrative style provided ample cement for such dialogue.         ''All she knew was that she was close against him and he was kissing her wildly, passionately, demandingly and the world stood still,'' she wrote in ''Fire in the Blood,'' published in 1983. ''He kissed her until he carried her as he had before up the peak of Olympus, and they were no longer human but one with the gods.'' Even with stuff as racy as this, readers came away thinking that her heroines remained as untouched as they had been in Chapter 1.         ''My heroines are always virgins,'' the writer said in 1973. ''They never go to bed without a ring on their fingers; not until page 118 at least.'' She also asserted that her notion of a truly sexy man was one who was ''fully clothed and preferably in uniform.''         People who watched Dame Barbara in action were not sure how she produced so much work. She wrote so quickly that even her fans were not always in agreement as to how many titles she had produced at any given time. Since mere typewriters could never keep up with her, she neatly avoided them and dictated her fiction to awestruck assistants who wrote furiously, backed up by tape recorders.         She was frequently able to dictate 7,000 words in an afternoon session, which usually lasted a few hours. She held forth from a sofa, a hot water bottle at her feet, her dog cuddled next to her, asleep. Her secretaries were not permitted to sneeze or cough while she dictated.         Perhaps in part because of her approach to dictating, her prose offers a prodigious number of one-sentence paragraphs, closer in its look to wire-service journalism than to the pages of Faulkner or Fitzgerald. In addition to her books she wrote some 30 plays. Asked why she wrote so much, she replied, ''I wanted the money.'' On other occasions, however, she denounced society's materialism, if not her own.         Barbara Hamilton Cartland was born in Warwickshire County, England, on July 9, 1901, the daughter of Bertram Cartland and Nancy H. Scobell Cartland, who was better known as Polly. Mr. Cartland was handsome and charming and came from a prominent family. But he could never have been the prototype for the novels his daughter would write. He was not a very good provider, and when his father's fortune was lost, forcing the family members to sell their house, it was Polly Cartland who led them into a home far less commodious than the one they had lost. The new one she rented offered only six bedrooms, a tennis court, stables and a garden that nobody had tended lately.         ''Poor I may be, but common I am not,'' Polly said, sounding not unlike the heroines her daughter would later create. The Cartlands made do, and young Barbara and her two brothers spent their formative years this way, learning to play tiddlywinks and other games. By the time she was 19, Dame Barbara said, she had rejected four proposals of marriage.         After she completed finishing school, she turned to writing and produced her first novel, ''Jigsaw,'' in 1922 when she was 21. It did not get good reviews -- one critic called it a ''modern feverish novel of the amateur'' -- but it went into six editions and was translated into five languages.         She married Alexander McCorquodale in 1927. He was a rich Scotsman widely known as an accomplished salmon fisherman. They were divorced five years later, and although she said she did not like the McCorquodale family much, she married Hugh McCorquodale, Alexander's cousin, in 1936. This marriage lasted until Hugh's death in 1963.         In addition to her writing, Dame Barbara found time to support many charities, promote aviation and work to improve the plight of pensioners and the acceptance of Gypsies in England. She was also credited with popularizing a swimming pool on the roof of the Hotel Piccadilly in London. She tried her hand at designing wallpaper and lent her name to a perfume. The perfume venture was unsuccessful, she said, because the perfume was not expensive enough.         In 1950 she moved into Camfield Place, a palace built in 1867, in which Beatrix Potter wrote ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' at the turn of the century. In 1991 she was made a Dame of the British Empire. She said she was sure the honor was not for her contributions to literature but for her efforts of behalf of charities and the Gypsies.         Dame Barbara is survived by a daughter, Raine, Countess Spencer, who was the stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales; and two sons, Ian and Hugh McCorquodale.         Dame Barbara was steadfast in her belief in vitamins -- at one point she took 78 a day -- and in yoga, clairvoyance, fruit sugar, ginseng, garlic and honey. She wrote so convincingly that honey was an aphrodisiac in ''The Magic of Honey,'' published in 1970, that a temporary shortage was created in Britain.         She had no use for smoking, white bread, white sugar and most forms of alcohol, but she drank brandy when she visited New York in 1981 because, she said, she could taste chlorine in the water.       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Teri Thornton, a jazz singer who had started to resurrect her career after winning the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 1998 and being signed to a major record label for the first time in three decades, died on Tuesday at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey. She was 65 and lived at the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood.         The cause was cancer of the bladder, said her manager, Suzi Reynolds.         Ms. Thornton had a husky, keening voice with a muscly vibrato; she was a vibrant performer with a caustic sense of humor, and she was particularly gifted at coaxing harmonic complexity and emotion out of the blues.         She was born in Detroit, where her parents, Robert Avery, a Pullman porter, and Burniece Crews Avery, a choir director and singer who was the host of a local radio show, encouraged her to study classical music.         Ms. Thornton, whose original name was Shirley Enid Avery, took up jazz instead, learning to sing and play the piano. By the age of 19, she was a divorced mother of two and had not yet begun to sing professionally.         But she found a spot at the Ebony Club in Cleveland and within a few years was living in Chicago and appearing with the saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Cannonball Adderley and finding work as the intermission pianist for strippers at the Red Garter nightclub.         Her career took off in 1961, with the release of her album ''Devil May Care,'' in which she sang in the company of the pianist Wynton Kelly and the Count Basie sidemen Clark Terry and Freddie Green. Her biggest hit, ''Somewhere in the Night,'' came a year later; it had been the theme of the television series ''Naked City,'' and she found herself singing it on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and other variety programs.         Ms. Thornton was signed by Columbia Records, and her exposure increased. She took part in a television program celebrating Duke Ellington's 40th anniversary in music, and Ella Fitzgerald told Down Beat magazine that Ms. Thornton was her favorite singer.         But at that point, her career started to slide. She attributed her downfall not only to the rise of rock 'n' roll but also to bad management and her addiction to drugs and alcohol. She moved to Los Angeles in the late 1960's and throughout the next decade took what jobs were available, including driving a taxi.         In 1979 she began her career again, playing and singing in piano bars. After moving to New York in the early 1980's she became a regular at small restaurant clubs like Zinno's and Cleopatra's Needle.         She was performing at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland in 1998 when she collapsed and underwent emergency surgery. Cancer was diagnosed and she underwent radiation and chemotherapy treatments, but she decided to compete in the Thelonious Monk competition in Washington.         The strength of her performance was undeniable, Peter Watrous wrote in The New York Times. She won the $20,000 prize ''by singing well and digging into some of the best aspects of black entertainment culture, the parts that make audience members and performers join in the same experience.''         Verve Records signed her, and she made an album called ''I'll Be Easy to Find.'' In January she filled a weeklong engagement at the Village Vanguard in Manhattan.         Ms. Thornton is survived by two sons, Kenneth Thornton of Detroit and Kelly Glusovich of New York; a daughter, Rose McKinney-James of Las Vegas; and six grandchildren.       
         Sybil Trent, a veteran of the golden age of radio and a star of the Saturday-morning children's radio show ''Let's Pretend,'' died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was lymphoma, said her son Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur.         Ms. Trent's voice was first heard on ''Let's Pretend'' in 1935, not long after she made her Broadway debut alongside Jimmy Durante, Gloria Grafton and Donald Novis, and atop an elephant, in Billy Rose's ''Jumbo,'' with songs by Rodgers and Hart,  at the Hippodrome Theater.         Over two decades, until the final broadcast of ''Let's Pretend'' in 1954, she entertained young listeners with renditions of princesses and fairy godmothers and found fame in her startlingly realistic ''baby cry.''         A precocious child, Ms. Trent began her career at the age of 3 1/2, when she performed in a short film with Fatty Arbuckle. Soon, she was singing and dancing her way through more than 25 shorts with stars like Ruth Etting and Jack Haley as a member of the Warner Brothers stock company.         Feature films at RKO followed, including ''The People's Enemy'' (1935) with Melvyn Douglas and Lila Lee, and ''Keep 'Em Rolling'' (1934) with Walter Huston.         By the age of 6, Ms. Trent was the host of her own radio show on WHN, ''Baby Sybil Elaine and Her Kiddie Revue,'' on which she would conjure  imitations of Joe Penner and the Block and Sully comedy team before closing with a sweetly sung ''Thank You for a Lovely Evening.''         One of the 150 charter members of the American Federation of Radio Artists, Ms. Trent also took the lead on ''We Love and Learn,'' ''Stella Dallas,'' ''Aunt Jenny'' and ''David Harum,'' and performed on shows like ''The Martha Raye Show,'' ''The Ed Sullivan Show''and Joe Franklin's ''Memory Lane.''         From 1973 to 1994, she was the casting director at the Young & Rubicam advertising agency in Manhattan.         Ms. Trent continued to do vocal work on commercials and in her spare time took reservations at her son's Manhattan restaurants.         ''The woman on the phone has the most delicious voice: low, slightly husky, completely inviting,'' Ruth Reichl wrote in 1994 in The New York Times of Ms. Trent's mellifluous tones. ''Just calling for a reservation makes you eager to eat at Montrachet.''         In addition to her son Drew, she is survived by another son, Tracy, and four grandchildren, all of New Jersey.       
         Elsie Widdowson, a nutritionist who used the discipline of wartime rationing to prescribe the healthiest diet in British history, died in Cambridge on June 14. She was 93.         The diet was an experimental plan for the goverment to promote for the citizens of Britain once its imports were impeded. Dr. Widdowson wrote it with her research partner of 60 years, Dr. R. A. McCance. It was based on bread, cabbage and potatoes, all of which were in relatively plentiful supply. Though aging British people, traditionally habitues of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, are most apt to remember the numbing taste of questionable delicacies like dried eggs, nutritionists say the lean, mean diet was the most nutritious the English ever forced down.         But that was only a small part of the legacy of the team known as ''Mac and Elsie.'' They profoundly affected how the world assessed nutritional values, how it investigated dietary deficiencies and how mammalian development was perceived. The two researchers would from time to time starve or overfeed volunteers of different age groups to study their metabolism. Their findings in the late 1930's on the body's need for salt became a key part of care for patients in diabetic comas and those with other ailments.         Along the way, they found time to do varied projects like studying the nutritional needs of concentration camp survivors and writing a medical journal article titled ''Food Lore From Nursery Rhymes.''         Working on her own at age 80, Dr. Widdowson chased seals on the Labrador ice floes to study their eating habits. A decade later, she published a paper on the physiology of the newborn bear.         Known for the twinkle in her eye, she kept generations of cats on her little farm, raised tomatoes, apples and bees, and ate lots of butter and eggs, which she considered good for people. Her sense of humor is suggested by her final advice after many an academic lecture: ''Take it with a grain of salt.''         She even gave the lie to the British maxim ''as different as chalk and cheese.'' To deal with the lack of calcium in people's diets because of a cheese shortage during World War II, she and Dr. McCance successfully pressed the government to add chalk to bread.         ''There is no branch of nutrition science, past or present, that has not been influenced in some way by the results of her pioneering work,'' a statement by the British Nutrition Foundation said, ''and because of the inspiration and encouragement she gave to nutrition scientists of all ages in the United Kingdom and overseas.''         Elsie May Widdowson was born and raised in Dulwich in Southeast London. She is survived by a younger sister, Eva Crane, who also became a noted scientist and for more than 30 years was director of the International Bee Research Association.         Their parents nourished the innate talent of the girls, who attended Sydenham County Secondary School. Elsie was one of the first women to graduate from Imperial College in London, where she studied chemistry. She also obtained her doctorate from Imperial, studying the chemistry of the compounds produced in ripening and stored fruit. She went to King's College in London to do postgraduate work on the subject.         She found herself spending time in hospital kitchens. She met a young doctor, Dr. McCance, who was studying the chemical consequences of cooking food. She realized his analyses of the carbohydrates in fruit were incorrect and told him so. He was delighted, and arranged a grant so she could work with him. Their collaboration continued until his death in 1993.         The initial step was combining her research on fruits and vegetables and his on meat, then collecting information on foods generally. The result was their 1940 book ''The Chemical Composition of Foods,'' which is known as the dietitian's bible and is now about to be published in its sixth edition.         With the onset of rationing, the two made guinea pigs of themselves and other scientists, living on questionable treats like Woolton Pie; it consisted of vegetables and bread crumbs and was named for Lord Woolton, the wartime Minister of Food, who fiercely promoted their very lean cuisine.         To prove the diet's effectiveness, the scientists decamped to the Lake District for vigorous exercise. In one day, they walked 36 miles and climbed 7,000 feet, burning 4,700 calories. They were none the worse for it. The only serious worry was a lack of calcium, a problem handled by adding ground chalk to bread flour.         After the war, Dr. Widdowson was asked to study how to treat the gross starvation suffered by survivors of Nazi concentration camps. She was then asked to study children in two German orphanages. She was amazed to find that children who had been given extra bread, jam and orange juice did worse in terms of development and growth than those who had not.         The difference, Dr. Widdowson surmised, could be explained only by the personality of the director at the orphanage where extra nutrition was provided. She was ''stern and forbidding, ruling the home with a rod of iron,'' Dr. Widdowson wrote. ''Children and staff lived in constant fear of her reprimands and criticisms, which were often quite unreasonable.''         It turned out that love was the healthiest food of all.       
         Nancy Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled at playing wise and imperious authority figures -- newspaper publishers, queens, grande dames and a madam -- and who achieved perhaps her greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss in the television series ''The Sopranos,''  died on Sunday at her home in Stratford, Conn., one day short of her 72nd birthday. She also had a home in Manhattan.         Her daughter Katie Sparer Bowe said that no specific cause of death was given, but for several years the actress had been suffering from cancer and chronic pulmonary disease.         A wide diversity of playwrights -- among them Chekhov, Shaw and  Shakespeare as well as Jean Genet, Paul Osborn and A. R. Gurney -- was within Ms. Marchand's range. She once described her physical presence as ''a strange combination of being very imposing and down-to-earth,'' an accurate assessment of the seemingly contradictory image she projected.         That description could be applied to the overburdened wife she played in the 1980 Broadway revival of Osborn's ''Morning's at Seven,'' the patrician publisher on the long-running ''Lou Grant'' television series and her portrayal of Livia Soprano, the monster mother of them all, a woman bred into the Mafia who without a blink of hesitation sets up her son Tony to be assassinated because he has moved her to a nursing home.         Except for her indomitability, Livia was in direct contrast to all the ''tasteful ladies'' Ms. Marchand  played in her busy career. At 70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of Caligula's great-grandmother in ''I, Claudius,'' a woman who also happened to be named Livia.         Throughout her career, Ms. Marchand gave her roles an unexpected edge. Even when her characters were at their most officious, they retained a measure of charm, and her more affectionate characters could also be sardonic. She was an expert at both light and more serious comedy, moving effortlessly from the outrageous antics in the movie spoof ''The Naked Gun,'' to Lady Bracknell in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''         In plays like ''Morning's at Seven,'' she warmed an audience's collective heart, but she never wore her own heart on her sleeve, avoiding the cul de sac of sentimentality. Instead she was wily in performance, turning in an instant from comedy to poignance.         Often she acted onstage with her husband, Paul Sparer -- in everything from ''A Phoenix Too Frequent'' by Christopher Fry to Edward Albee's ''Delicate Balance'' to Mr. Gurney's ''Love Letters.'' Mr. Sparer also had his own rewarding career in plays that included Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God'' and ''The Burnt Flowerbed'' by Ugo Betti. Individually and together they were ultimate theatrical professionals.         Mr. Sparer died in November. In addition to her daughter Katie, an actress who lives in Stratford, Ms. Marchand is survived by a son, David of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Rachel Sparer Bersier, an opera singer of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.         Offstage, Ms. Marchand was the reverse of so many of her strong-willed characters, a woman with a natural sense of insecurity, someone who felt uneasy in social situations. ''I'm always very uncomfortable with people.'' she once explained in an interview in The New York Times. ''It's something that I get upset with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And  when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe. There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can experience and share when I'm on a stage.''         Her roles, she said, were more a question of chance than choice. But whatever she was called on to do, even if it meant being as malevolent as Livia Soprano, she did it with enthusiasm. As always, she was captivated by her profession. Looking back on her career, she said, ''Acting was something I had to do.''         Nancy Marchand was born in Buffalo on June 19, 1928. After studying theater at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, she made her first professional appearance onstage in 1946 in ''The Late George Apley'' in Ogunquit, Me. It was while acting in Shakespeare and Shaw at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., that she met -- and then married -- Mr. Sparer. When they moved to New York, she appeared on live television, playing Jo in a dramatization of ''Little Women,'' and then playing the female lead opposite Rod Steiger in the original television version of Paddy Chayefsky's ''Marty.''         In 1957 she made her Broadway debut in ''Miss Isobel,'' and two years later won an Obie award for her role as Madame Irma in the Off Broadway premiere of ''The Balcony'' by Genet. For several years she played leading Shakespearean roles with the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. As an original member of the A.P.A. theater company (formally the Association of Producing Artists), she was Lady Sneerwell in ''The School for Scandal,'' Arkadina in ''The Seagull,'' Dona Ana in ''Man and Superman'' and other classic characters.         Continuing her devotion to repertory theater, she joined the theater at Lincoln Center to act in plays by Schiller (Queen Elizabeth in ''Mary Stuart''), Gorky and Sean O'Casey (''The Plough and the Stars'' with Jack MacGowran).         Ms. Marchand worked with equal ease on Broadway, off Broadway and in regional theater, as well as in movies and on television. In the 1980's she played the title role in Christopher Durang's ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' Bessie Berger in Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing'' at Circle in the Square, Klytemnestra in Ezra Pound's ''Elektra'' and the august mother in ''The Cocktail Hour'' by Mr. Gurney.         In the following decade, she moved on to Jon Robin Baitz's ''End of the Day'' at Playwrights Horizons, and, in 1993, acted in a double header of Peter Shaffer plays, ''Black Comedy'' and ''White Liars,'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. That same year she also played the wicked stepmother in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' at the New York City Opera.         Her movie appearances included ''The Hospital''; two films with the team of Merchant Ivory, ''The Bostonians'' and ''Jefferson in Paris'';  and the remake of ''Sabrina,'' in which she played Harrison Ford's mother. When she played Mrs. Pynchon, the publisher of The Los Angeles Tribune on ''Lou Grant,'' the role became a keystone of her career; for it she won four Emmy awards. Some years later on television's ''Spearfield's Daughter,'' she switched cities and became the publisher of The New York Courier.         When Ms. Marchand played Livia Soprano on ''The Sopranos,'' television viewers wondered how her son Tony, played by James Gandolfini, and his wife (Edie Falco) could put up with her malice and her prejudices. The answer, of course, was that there was nothing much they could do against this self-dramatizing force of nature.         At the end of the show's first season, Tony was about to smother his mother with a pillow, but a stroke got there first and she was left gasping for breath in a hospital bed. David Chase, the creator of the Home Box Office series, said yesterday that he always planned to bring Livia back for a second year. He added that he was impressed by Ms. Marchand's  courage as she continued to perform despite her illness.         When that season ended, Ms. Marchand said she was looking forward to the second round: ''Who knows what lurks in the mind of Livia?'' Viewers soon found out: more of the same.         During the last show of the second season, there was a sudden twist in the narrative. Tony gave his mother airline tickets so that she and his aunt could fly to Arizona. Before she could get on the plane, Livia was stopped by men from airport security. The tickets were stolen property. Frantically, she telephoned her son.         Because filming on the third season of ''Sopranos'' was not scheduled to begin until Aug. 1, that scene represents Ms. Marchand's final performance: about to be arrested and furious at Tony for putting her in that predicament. Mr. Chase would not discuss forthcoming events in the series, but if the actress had lived, undoubtedly the mother and son battle would have continued and Livia Soprano would have had the last word.         Correction:  June 21, 2000, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand yesterday misidentified Livia, a Roman historical figure, in some copies. Livia, to whom Ms. Marchand compared her television role as Livia in ''The Sopranos,'' was the great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula, not his mother.         A page one reference to the obituary misstated the character's name as Lydia in some copies.         Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand on Tuesday misstated the title of a Peter Shaffer play in which she appeared with the Roundabout Theater Company in 1993. It is ''White Lies,'' not ''White Liars.''       
         Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial equality in her native South Africa,  died at home in London on Monday, her literary agent, Felicity Bryan, said. She was 80.         Miss Benson's books included a novel, ''At the Still Point,'' and biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the time, written while Mr. Mandela was still serving his long prison term and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In her memoir, ''A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Miss Benson told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.         Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the cause in London.         It was Miss Benson whom Mr. Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when, after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support in West and East Africa, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the door, Mr. Mandela was standing beside him.         ''I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,'' Miss Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mr. Mandela paced up and down her apartment, brimming with ideas. ''He talked so excitedly and with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''         Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo ship as a teenager, using a mix of charm and determination to win interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she then wrote.         Restless and daring, Miss Benson served as an aide to various British generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming secretary to the director David Lean.         It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' that Miss Benson saw her country with new eyes and discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a correspondence with Mr. Paton (she was also to develop intense correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans. She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom she fell in love.         Miss Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of the defense fund for the 156 people, Mr. Mandela among them, who had been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her life, Miss Benson turned her attention to writing. When the African National Congress was banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mr. Mandela when he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a car in which he posed as her chauffeur.         Among Miss Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed African National Congress, published in the United States as ''South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials that resulted in long prison terms for the A.N.C.'s members, Miss Benson was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years -- for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed -- but continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990's. She never married.         Among other projects, Miss Benson also edited Athol Fugard's ''Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She was also the author of ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater.''         On the occasion of Miss Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mr. Mandela sent a message from South Africa. ''It reminds me of all the great help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he wrote. ''I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous friendship over half a lifetime.''         Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about the South African writer Mary Benson misstated the title of one of her books. It is ''Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater,'' not ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith.''       
         Alice Lord Landon, a pioneer in women's swimming and diving who was a presence on the American Olympic scene for eight decades, died last Thursday at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 98.         At age 13, Alice Lord swam nine miles across Long Island Sound. At 18, she was a platform diver on the first United States women's swimming team in the Olympics.         At 82, she led the procession of American athletes at the Los Angeles Olympics, wearing a replica of her uniform from the 1920 Games at Antwerp, Belgium.         And at 94, she carried the torch for the Atlanta Games when it moved through Daytona Beach, Fla.         ''Alice was the grand dame of the Olympians,'' said Dorothy Franey Langkop, honorary executive director of United States Olympians, an association of former competitors that the diver and her husband, the Olympic high-jump champion Dick Landon, helped found in the mid-1940's.         Lord Landon was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1993.         She was evidently the oldest female American Olympian, according to the United States Olympic Committee. Hal Prieste, 103, who won a diving bronze medal for the United States in 1920, is listed as the oldest living American Olympian.         Growing up in Brooklyn and then Westchester County, Alice Lord was encouraged by her father to pursue physical fitness.         ''My brother and I walked 20 miles a day,'' she would recall. ''I swam distance, going a little further and faster every day, but not for competition. I wasn't working to make the Olympics, because I didn't know what the Olympics were.''         She began competing with the newly formed Women's Swimming Association of New York, which dominated the emerging sport. But diving conditions were primitive. The practice pools were often only 6 feet deep, forcing Lord Landon to snap forward quickly and cup her hands after entering the water to keep her head from hitting the bottom.         Competing at the 1920 Games, she was handicapped by the lack of a coach and failed to make the finals in platform diving. But her teammates from the swimming association were among the stars of the Games. Aileen Riggin Soule, now 94, won the gold medal in springboard diving, and Ethelda Bleibtrey captured three golds in swimming to lead an American women's sweep.         On the ship going to Antwerp, Alice Lord met Dick Landon, and the high-jumper and the diver were married two years later in a burst of publicity over their Olympic romance.         ''He got so tired of answering how we met,'' she remembered long afterward. ''Finally he answered that we met in midair: he was going up and I was going down.''         Lord Landon remained active in the Olympic movement. She was an official of United States Olympians, held the starter's gun for women's swimming in the Olympic trials during the 1920's and 1930's, helped choose team uniforms and raised money for the United States squads.         She is survived by a daughter, Bunny McMunn, of Ormond Beach; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild. Her husband died in 1971.         Although she promoted the Olympic movement, Lord Landon spoke out on its blemishes. She felt that the Olympic ideal of placing participation above winning was violated when winners were honored but losers were forgotten.         ''The creed is fine,'' she said. ''It hasn't always been lived up to.''       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Laurel Fox Vlock, who was instrumental in the videotaping and archiving of many survivors' accounts of the sufferings caused by the Holocaust, died on Saturday in New Haven, Conn. She was 74 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.         She died of injuries suffered in a car accident on Friday, said Kathy Landau, a friend.         She also worked in television as a producer and in other capacities.         A native of New Haven, Ms. Vlock first learned about the Holocaust in her youth, when her parents, John J. and Rose Greenberg Fox, were aiding its victims during World War II.         Later she was profoundly moved when she heard an Auschwitz survivor tell of his experiences. She was a local filmmaker in 1979 when she and  Dr. Dori Laub, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, founded the New Haven-based Holocaust Survivors Film Project to compile videotaped interviews with survivors.         Soon after the project began, Ms. Vlock said in an interview in The New York Times, ''Everybody talks about the unspeakable, but it is speakable, and when it is spoken, it has a force that isn't found anywhere else.''         Ms. Vlock was a co-founder of what came to be called the Fortunoff Archive of Holocaust Testimonies, at Yale University. At the archive's formal opening in 1982, when it already contained 250 taped interviews, she observed that, with 40 years having passed since the Holocaust, the time left for collecting first-hand accounts was ''indeed running out.''         By 1985 the archive had more than 700 videotaped testimonies. Roughly half were recorded in the New Haven area. Others were donated by similar projects in California, Illinois, Long Island and Israel. By 1995 there were 3,200 taped testimonies.         Ms. Vlock was an adviser to the archive for almost two decades. People who viewed the tapes ''have an epiphany,'' she said in a 1985 interview. ''They understand for the first time why people don't forget 40 years later.''         In 1981 she won an Emmy Award for a television documentary about survivors, ''Forever Yesterday,'' filmed for WNEW-TV in New York. Some of the survivors who were interviewed wept as they described the murder of loved ones long ago.         Ms. Vlock received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a master's degree from Queens College.         Her survivors include her mother,  who is 102, of New Haven; her husband, Jay; two sons, Daniel, of Ridgefield, Conn., and Michael, of Stony Creek, Conn.; a daughter, Sandra Vlock, also of Stony Creek; a sister, Marian Wexler of New Haven; and nine grandchildren.       
         Thea Dispeker, a molder of operatic talent from Lauritz Melchior to Richard Leech and boss of her own classical music artists agency for more than 50 years, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 97.         Laurence Wasserman, her successor at the New York-based management agency that still bears her name, said that she had relinquished control (she called retirement a dirty word) only reluctantly in late 1998, shortly after her 96th birthday. Until then, Ms. Dispeker, erudite, opinionated, acerbic, often presided at auditions in her penthouse apartment on East 79th Street after full days at the offices of Thea Dispeker Inc., (pronounced TAY-uh DIS-peck-uh) at 59 East 54th Street.         ''She was much more interested in developing talent than taking over the great names,'' said Mr. Wasserman, who had contracted with Ms. Dispeker in 1977, when she was almost 75, to succeed her as the company's president.         Yet her career was bound up with some of the 20th century's greatest musical names: Richard Tucker, Martina Arroyo, Judith Blegen, Roberta Peters, Jan Peerce, Hermann Prey, Pablo Casals and Wieland Wagner among many others. Indeed, as some associates saw it, Ms. Dispeker was the century.         Born Dorothea Schlesinger in Munich in 1902, she studied piano and was tutored by her father, a lawyer, author and violinist who had married the daughter of a wealthy banker. At 12, she briefly ran off with a passing circus before going on to study musicology at the University of Munich. After a visit to Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt in 1924 she contracted polio. But she recovered and worked in Munich with the renowned musicologist Alfred Einstein, marrying and soon divorcing a man named Dispeker and finally fleeing Nazi Germany for the United States in 1938. Still she remained an ardent Germanophile all her life.         In New York, she gave piano lessons. She started a classical music section of the W. Colston Leigh speakers bureau, where she represented Melchior and other opera stars. When she went into business for herself in 1947, she won Tucker as a client, and later James King, Arlene Saunders, Maria Stader, Benita Valente, and other singers and instrumentalists.         In 1947 she helped found the Little Orchestra Society for children's concerts. In 1950, she organized the first Pablo Casals festival in the tiny village of Prades, France, where Casals was living in exile from Spain.         In 1950, she married a fellow refugee from Germany, Lawrence Grieg, known as Lolo. He died in 1986. They had no children.         Oblivious to advancing age, Ms. Dispeker sought out young singers and musicians to promote; she emerged with a portfolio of rising stars, including Mr. Leech, the tenor, and the Swedish baritone, Hakan Hagegard. ''She had a nose for talent,'' said Mr. Wasserman.         ''Thea has always been open to hearing anybody who calls the office for an audition,'' said Mr. Leech, who signed with the agency during his first season with the New York City Opera in 1984. ''She's been a beacon for opportunity for young singers.''         In 1997 the International Society for the Performing Arts Foundation gave her an award of merit timed to the 50th anniversary of her agency.         But she was almost as famous for her prickly interpersonal relations with staff and other associates, and her sparring with Mr. Wasserman was an open secret in the music management business. Although she continued until several years ago to drive, employees came to dread her friendly invitations for a lift home, finding the rides often terrifying.         ''I was always a very secure person,'' Ms. Dispeker told an interviewer three years ago, when she was 94. ''I always instinctively knew what was right and wrong and what was good and what was bad. That's mainly what people miss today.''       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Ginetta Sagan, a leader of the American branch of Amnesty International who as a girl fought World War II's injustices in Europe and suffered for it, died last Friday at her home in Atherton, Calif., between San Francisco and San Jose. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, said the American organization, which named her honorary chairwoman in 1994, the year she also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.         Mrs. Sagan, a native of Milan, was active in Italy's anti-Fascist Resistance in World War II and survived torture and imprisonment. Denied dignity and freedom then, she championed prisoners of conscience for the rest of her life.         She came to Washington in the 1960's and helped establish the American division of Amnesty International. The worldwide group had been  founded in London in 1961 to speak for the victims of oppressive regimes. Today Amnesty International has 1.1 million members, 290,000 in the United States.         When she moved to California, Mrs. Sagan formed the group's first outposts in the western United States.  She served two terms on the national board, and Amnesty International U.S.A. now gives an annual Ginetta Sagan Award for outstanding work on behalf of oppressed women and children.         Mrs. Sagan was born Ginetta Moroni, the daughter of doctors who would both work for the Italian Resistance. By the time she was 17, she was taking clothing and food coupons to beleaguered Jews.         Her parents were arrested in 1943, and she never saw them again. That year she became a courier for a clandestine party in northern Italy and helped print and distribute pamphlets. She was betrayed, and arrested by the Fascist authorities, who subjected her to 45 days of interrogation and torture.         But there were instances of unexpected kindness, too. A jailer once threw a loaf of bread into her cell, and inside she found a matchbox and a slip of paper with a single word: ''coraggio'' -- courage.         And when members of the Resistance engineered her escape from prison in the Alpine town of Sondrio, near Lake Como, on April 23, 1945, they were helped by two German officers.         She then lived in Paris with her godfather, an American banker, and attended the Sorbonne. By 1951, she was studying child development at the University of Illinois's Chicago campus, where she met and married Leonard Sagan, a medical student. Their work and travels took them to Washington, Boston, Japan and finally the San Francisco Bay Area.         In addition to forming new Amnesty chapters, Mrs. Sagan established the Aurora Foundation, which documents civil rights abuses in countries with authoritarian governments.         Dr. Leonard Sagan, a physician, died in 1997. Mrs. Sagan is survived by three sons: Loring, of San Francisco; Duncan, of Newark, Calif.; and Pico, of London, as well as six grandchildren.       
         Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.         Mrs. Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960's. She helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated 10,000 black adults were registered.         At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of black adults were not registered. Thanks largely to Mrs. Devine, blacks began to show up at the county courthouse almost daily, demanding to register.         She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer. Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, of which Mrs. Devine was a founder.         After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run, but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom Democrats and calls for Congressional investigations into voting in Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the civil rights struggle.         In the 1960's she also helped found the Child Development Group of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community support.         Mrs. Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Sophie Davis, a successful businesswoman whose backing helped create the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education at the City College of New York, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 74.         The cause was breast cancer, her son Alan said.         Mrs. Davis helped her husband. Leonard, found the Colonial Penn Group of insurance companies, and they gave millions of dollars to art, dance, music and Jewish philanthropic causes, including the Holocaust Museum in Washington.         But one project in which she took the most pride was the medical program at City College, which helps place economically disadvantaged students into medicine with the understanding that they will practice for at least two years in low-income communities.         Students in the seven-year accelerated medical degree program take three years of undergraduate work at City College, two years of medical training at Sophie Davis and their final two years at one of six cooperating medical schools, including New York University and SUNY/Downstate. The graduates are known as ''Sophies.''         The Davises' first gift, $1.2 million, to the school, which began as an experimental program, was given anonymously in 1972. Five years later, Mrs. Davis agreed to have her name attached to the school.         When the school gave her an honorary degree at that time, she brought a phalanx of friends and relatives to the ceremony to see her in her academic cap and gown; she had dropped out of City College to get married.         Mrs. Davis was born in 1926 in the Bronx to Isadore and Esther Kesten, immigrants from Minsk, Russia. After skipping a grade in high school, she attended City College at night; there she studied accounting and met Leonard Davis, whom she married in 1945. He survives her.         In addition to her husband and her son Alan, of San Francisco, Mrs. Davis is survived by another son, Michael, of Belvedere, Calif., and four grandchildren.         While Mr. Davis worked as an accountant and later in the insurance business, Mrs. Davis worked at his side, organizing the office, handling the bookkeeping and serving as his sounding board. She was also a director of the Colonial Penn Group, which they founded in 1963, until they sold it in 1984.         ''I always discussed everything with her,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We made the decisions jointly, based on which one of us felt the strongest. Sometimes we had to figure out which of us that was.''         He said that the company avoided borrowing money, for example, because Mrs. Davis violently opposed it.         But he prevailed on the issue of buying a magazine that later merged with Modern Maturity, the magazine of the AARP, which he helped found. ''She was opposed, and she got the other senior members of my staff to oppose it, too,'' Mr. Davis recalled. ''But I felt very strongly about it, so we bought it.''         The Sophie Davis medical school was one of many projects the couple supported at City College. They also provided funds for a performing arts center, Aaron Davis Hall, named after Mr. Davis's father. Mrs. Davis helped choose some of the resident performers, and she and her husband often entertained them after performances.         As the Davises began to spend more and more time in Palm Beach (although they kept their Fifth Avenue apartment), they played a similar role as impresarios, establishing the Regional Arts Foundation, with Mrs. Davis as president, in the early 1970's. The foundation brought performers like Isaac Stern, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New York City Ballet to southern Florida, then considered by some a cultural wasteland.         ''She felt a responsibility to bring music and dance to this area,'' said Judith Mitchell, chief executive of the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm Beach, which took over the performance series in 1994.         The Davises also became involved with the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach. Mrs. Davis served as a trustee and spearheaded the drive to build a new wing.         But even from Florida, she kept in touch with the medical school named after her. She and her husband gave the school another $2 million for an endowed scholarship fund in their names. And last year, when she attended the graduation ceremony, the students stood up and started chanting her name: ''Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!''       
         Paula Yates,  a British television personality known for her outrageously flirtatious interviewing style and for her relationships with the rock stars Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence, was found dead at home here on Sunday. She was 40.         The cause was apparently a drug overdose, the authorities said.         Reared in north Wales, Ms. Yates left school at 16 and moved to London, where she joined the emerging punk scene and embarked on an extravagant -- and extravagantly public -- life. When she became enamored of Mr. Geldof, who was then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, she followed the band on tour until Mr. Geldof became just as smitten with her, and they embarked on a relationship. They married 10 years later and had three daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie.         Ms. Yates reveled in the spotlight, posing naked in the stuffy Reform Club for Penthouse magazine and compiling a book of photographs called ''Rock Stars in Their Underpants,'' which Andy Warhol called ''the greatest work of art in the last decade.'' She also wrote several books for children, but it was not until she started her television career as a co-presenter of ''The Tube,'' a show about music, that she became a celebrity in her own right, affecting a bubbleheaded, giggly personality that belied her sharp intelligence, friends said.         In 1992 she began presenting ''The Big Breakfast Show,'' a morning television program in which she often interviewed guests while lying on a bed in the studio. One guest was Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the band INXS, and the two fell madly in love. She left Mr. Geldof, setting off a bitter, tabloid-fueled divorce and an equally bitter fight for custody of their three daughters. Mr. Geldof won.         Ms. Yates and Mr. Hutchence had an intensely passionate affair and one child, a daughter they named Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. But their relationship was marred by drug use and extreme behavior that ended when Mr. Hutchence was found dead, hanging by his belt, in a hotel room in Sydney, Australia, in November 1997.         Ms. Yates, who once said that Mr. Hutchence was ''God's gift to women,'' seemed never to recover from his death, spiraling into a depression that resulted in her admission to a mental hospital and at least one suicide attempt of her own.         It was hard for her to hang on, she once said in an interview. ''It's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day,'' she said. ''Right now, I think living is a noble gesture.''       
         Mary Shepard, the modest illustrator whose line drawings of Mary Poppins brought to life the ultimate British nanny in a series of seven books by P. L. Travers published from 1933 to 1988, died in London on Sept. 4. She was 90.         Her father was E. H. Shepard, the illustrator of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ''The Wind in the Willows.'' When ''Mary Poppins'' was being readied for publication, Pamela Travers wanted him to do the pictures.         He was too busy, but, as Miss Travers wrote almost a half-century later, on a friend's mantle she saw a Christmas card that had ''a happy imperfection, a sense of wonder.'' It was done by Mary Shepard, then 23 and just out of the Slade School of Art.         Travers's editor, Peter Llewelyn Davis (in the tight British literary world he was one of the Lost Boys befriended by J. M. Barrie, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the parents in ''Mary Poppins,'' bore more than a passing resemblance to the Darlings of ''Peter Pan''), worried about Miss Shepard's inexperience, but their collaboration had begun.         And it was a collaboration. In an attic, Travers said, she found a wooden peg Dutch doll with painted coal-black hair, a turned-up nose and small, bright blue eyes that became the model.         That doll was later sent to the Donnell Library in Manhattan. But Miss Shepard bought a similar one to use as she drew. She wanted the nanny to stand in the fifth ballet position, with feet turned out and nearly parallel, but Travers insisted on the more comfortable fourth position, with the feet at right angles. Travers died in 1996 at the age of 96.         In the 1964 Walt Disney movie starring Julie Andrews, the time period and decor were pushed back from the 1930's of the book illustrations to a plush Edwardian era, but Ms. Andrews's costume and bearing stayed true to Miss Shepard's drawings (with her feet back to the fifth position), and Miss Shepard received a payment from the filmmakers.         Mary Eleanor Jessie Shepard was born on Christmas Day 1909. She had an idyllic Edwardian childhood and an artistic education.         In 1937 she married E. V. Knox, a friend and colleague of her father's, and outside publishing was known as Mary Knox. Her husband, who had been a widower, was the editor of Punch, the humor magazine. She was only seven years older than Knox's daughter, Penelope, who as Penelope Fitzgerald began publishing novels in her late 50's and died last spring at the age of 83. Knox died in 1971.         As they grew older, the two women became more like sisters. They lived near each other, talked every day and took care of each other, especially after Knox's death.         Miss Shepard was Auntie Mary to Fitzgerald's three children and had only one other relative, Minette Hunt, the daughter of her brother, who was killed in World War II. Her last drawings were made for a Fitzgerald grandchild, shortly after she entered the nursing home where she spent her last years. She did not know that Penelope had died.         A family memorial service was held at the Hampstead Parish Church on Sept. 14, where Miss Shepard worshiped daily as long as she was able. She was so modest that she said she did not wish to be buried with her husband in the pretty Hampstead cemetery because her name would add clutter to his stone.         Instead, the Fitzgerald children, Maria Fitzgerald, Tina Dooley and Balphy Fitzgerald, have arranged that twin stones be placed next to Knox's. They will be side by side above the cremated remains of Penelope and Mary, one showing a hand with a pen, the other, a hand with a paintbrush.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneer in journalism, especially because she worked at a time when few women held positions of power in the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way to a circulation of 50,000 from 12,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction to and informal education in journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered with  charities. Society columnists called her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had been editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. The two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and kept up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, the Hollywood financier who is Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married Amos Mathews around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up its news coverage.

         Sonja Bullaty, a photographer noted for lyrical composition and startling use of color and light in a vast body of work created during a five-decade collaboration with her husband, Angelo Lomeo, died on Oct. 5 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 76, and had homes in Manhattan and Bellmont, Vt.         The cause was cancer, Mr. Lomeo said.         Born in Prague into a Jewish banking family, Ms. Bullaty received her first camera at 14, a consolation gift from her father for having to abandon school and normal teenage activities as their world darkened with the approach of war.         ''I have loved the camera ever since, because it gave me joy and it gave me a life,'' she said. ''In the following difficult years I had no camera but often saw things indelibly etched on my mind. Perhaps to this day I search for some of those missing images.''         She was deported to Poland on her 18th birthday and spent the next four years in captivity, first in the Lodz Ghetto, then in the Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camps. Toward the end of the war, she escaped a death march near Dresden, which was then in flames, by hiding with a girlfriend in a haystack in the barn where the prisoners had been held for the night. Although Nazi soldiers, armed with pitchforks, were sent back to roust the women, they remained undetected, and Ms. Bullaty managed by stay alive until liberation allowed her to return to Prague.         There, she discovered that none of her family had survived.         Eventually, she sought out the well-known Czech photographer Josef Sudek and over time became what he called his ''apprentice-martyr,'' mixing chemicals for the darkroom, filing negatives and absorbing the unwritten rules of composition as she watched him print his dark, moody, almost abstract works. Master and pupil, they shared an affinity for the simplicity of windows and the mystery of reflections, and a fondness for patriotic kitsch and the seemingly banal. Ms. Bullaty wrote about her mentor in a 1978 book, ''Sudek.''         In 1947, she arrived in New York, her boat fare paid by distant relatives who found her name on a survivors' list and invited her to stay with them.         That same year, she met Mr. Lomeo when she inquired over an intercom about a darkroom in the building he managed and he went in search of the woman behind a voice he called ''the most beautiful I had ever heard.'' He offered her a gift of apples, and they became almost immediately inseparable. They married in 1951, and for five decades lived and worked together while managing to retain their individual visual perspectives. He is her only survivor.         During the next decade, the couple built a reputation photographing paintings and sculptures in museums and galleries.         They began shooting in black and white and were well into their joint career when they turned, in the early 1970's, to the vivid, saturated color now associated with them.         Critics often remarked on the painterly aspects of their compositions, on the evocations of Hopper and Magritte, of van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne and the Venetian colorists.         Together they made six books, ''Provence,'' ''Tuscany,'' ''Venice and the Veneto,'' ''Circle of Seasons: Central Park Celebrated,'' ''Vermont in All Weathers,'' and ''America America,'' published this year by Abbeville Press. Their photographs appeared in Life, Time and Audubon magazines and have been exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the International Center of Photography and George Eastman House in Rochester.         ''I want to express with it what I see, experience and feel, a world real or surreal, sad or funny, but a world uniquely my own,'' Ms. Bullaty said of the guiding force behind her work. ''Perhaps to live I needed to know there is beauty.''       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Andy Logan, the reporter whose witty, elegant and gently sarcastic voice dissected the goings-on at New York's City Hall for The New Yorker magazine for 25 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been ill with pancreatic cancer.         For two decades, Ms. Logan was the dean of the City Hall press corps, a diminutive figure in black with an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's social and political history. She was a mentor to dozens of younger reporters and most days carried cookies to the press room, known as Room 9, for the harried reporters she referred to as kids. She covered five mayors, from John V. Lindsay to Rudolph W. Giuliani, and was fond of using their own words to expose hypocrisies and explode myths.         ''The world I cover is so full of vaudeville,'' she told a reporter in 1992. ''The worst thing you can do to politicians is to quote them verbatim. Such naked foolishness.''         Ms. Logan was born in Cleveland on Feb. 6, 1920, and grew up in Ohio and North Carolina. She attended Swarthmore College, where she wrote fiction and started a life of letters. She won an O. Henry Award in 1941 for her first published short story, ''The Visit.''         It was at college that Ms. Logan changed her name from Isabel Ann to Andy. She detested the nickname Izzy and chose Andy in honor of the New Yorker essayist E.B. White, who was also known as Andy.         The New Yorker hired her as soon as she graduated, in 1942, and she became one of the first women to write for ''The Talk of the Town.''  During a half century with the magazine, she wrote more than 260 articles, along with three short stories and four poems. Her subjects ranged from the Nuremberg trials, to 19th century New York scandals, to the yearly review of toys at Christmastime.         In 1943, she married Charles S. Lyon, who was a deputy chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials and later became a United States assistant attorney general. They had seven children. He died in 1989 at the age of 72. She is survived by two sons:  Brooks, of Canandaigua, N.Y., and Jonathan, of New York City; a daughter, Emily Lyon, of Cambridge, Mass.; and one granddaughter, Corinna Lyon.         ''There was nothing to be compared with coming home after school and sitting down with my parents,'' Ms. Logan's daughter said. ''They would talk about everything, and make it so clear.''         Ms. Logan was also the author of two historical books: In ''Against the Evidence'' (McCall, 1970), she chronicled the 1912 trial of a police lieutenant, Charles Becker, who was convicted, wrongly she maintained, of shooting a smalltime gambler. She also published ''The Man Who Robbed the Robber Barons'' (W.W. Norton & Company, 1965), an account of the career of Col. William d'Alton Mann.         But it was at City Hall that she would become a local literary legend. Her first About City Hall column appeared in 1969, though her expert knowledge of city politics stretched back to the La Guardia administration.         ''I can scare the hell out of the kids by telling them that the mayor when I first came down here was La Guardia,'' she said in 1992. ''They help me in and out of the room for at least an hour after that.''         In her City Hall reporting, she earned a reputation for saving every scrap of news about the political figures she covered and forgetting nothing they had said. Her columns often pointed out the comic side of politics, exposing where noble words hide selfish designs.         ''She wrote about the city and City Hall as if it were a passing parade, with a great sense of irony and wit,'' said David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker. ''To me, she was like Murray Kempton, an essential voice and treasure of New York.''         Her columns often did not endear her to mayors. Mayor Edward I. Koch once said he detested her and ''disinvited'' her to the annual Christmas party for reporters at Gracie Mansion, an insult she wore like a badge of honor.         ''She believed in flaying, and most people don't like to be skinned,'' Mr. Koch said yesterday. But in the same breath, he praised her reporting. ''She was a repository of City Hall history,'' he said. ''She had covered so many mayors and kept minute records of everything they said.''         Her unpopularity with some politicians may have reflected her unwillingness to buy their favorite mantras. Ms. Logan's writing often pierced political rhetoric. Writing about Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1992, for instance, she said:         ''The theme of the speech was a message that the mayor delivers daily, and sometimes more often, at City Hall: that the Reagan-Bush administrations abandoned the nation's cities, and particularly this one, and that the federal government should resume its old, generous (Democratic) ways -- that is, 'Send money.' Back in the years when Nelson Rockefeller was New York's governor, he had a habit of working the phrase 'Brotherhood of Man in the Fatherhood of God' so regularly into speeches that Albany reporters would simply write down 'bomfog'  and turn their attention elsewhere. At the Dinkins City Hall, when the mayor brings up the abandonment of cities, often at considerable length, reporters can write down 'ban-cit' and take five.''         To her colleagues in Room 9, Ms. Logan was a teacher and inspiration. George Arzt, who covered city government for The New York Post for 18 years, recalled his first day on the job, when he was asked to cover the Board of Estimate, which he had never heard of before, and to untangle a complicated question pending before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.         ''Andy Logan, who I had never met before, took me by the arm and said, 'Why do you have that wild look in your eyes,' and I said, 'I don't know what I'm doing,' '' he recalled. ''And she sat me down, told me what was going on and practically dictated the story to me.''         Ms. Logan kept her office at The New Yorker until the end of her life.         ''She was sort of the institutional memory of the place,'' said John Bennet, an editor at the magazine. Well into her seventies, colleagues said, she could still be found at her desk late into the evening or on Saturday mornings.         Correction:  November 23, 2000, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Andy Logan, the longtime New York City Hall reporter for The New Yorker, referred imprecisely to her tenure. While her column, About City Hall, appeared from 1969 to 1994 and she was the acknowledged dean of the City Hall press corps for the last 20 years of that time, she wrote about municipal affairs both before and after the life of the column.       
         Juliet Garretson Hollister, in whose kitchen an interfaith organization called the Temple of Understanding was born 40 years ago, died on Sunday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 84.         In 1960, at a time when nuclear Armageddon was not unthinkable, she felt the need to do something, she said later.         As she recalled it, she was sitting in her kitchen when, over peanut butter sandwiches, she told a like-minded friend, ''The world is in a mess.'' Her prescription, for a starter, was to promote dialogue and understanding among the world's religions.         Mrs. Hollister, who was ''just a nice little mother,'' as she put it, at first got nowhere. She was also, however, the wife of a well-connected partner in a Manhattan law firm and did not simply take the ''no'' of foundation executives. Then she met Eleanor Roosevelt, who liked her idea and opened doors for her.         Mrs. Hollister's idea became the Temple of Understanding, which grew into an international educational group recognized by the United Nations as a nongovernmental organization.         As its moving spirit and chairwoman, Mrs. Hollister met and became acquainted with world figures like the Dalai Lama. From its Manhattan headquarters and under her leadership, the group organized symposiums, round-table discussions at the United Nations, educational projects, global forums and spiritual summit meetings abroad.         In addition to Mrs. Roosevelt, she was supported by Dr. Albert Schweitzer; Pope John XXIII; U Thant, secretary general of the United Nations; Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India; and President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt.         The Temple of Understanding has chapters overseas and was based in New York at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights before moving in the 1990's to its present center, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street.         Mrs. Hollister's husband, Dickerman Hollister, died in 1983. She is survived by their two sons, G. Clay, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Dickerman Jr., of Greenwich; a daughter, Catharine H. Ecton of Cabin John, Md.; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         Juliet Garretson was born in Forest Hills, Queens. She studied comparative religion at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary, but as a woman found the road to a career in theology blocked.         But reading up on the world's great faiths, she became convinced that they all, in one way or another, shared basic humane principles.         That belief inspired her concept of the Temple of Understanding as an educational platform and a meeting place for people to learn about one another's creeds: what Eleanor Roosevelt called a ''spiritual United Nations.''       
         Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, whose deep sense of obligation to others and passion for charity work led her to build an international network of homes and treatment centers for the sick and disabled, died on Thursday at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St. Edmunds, England. She was 77.         A small woman of indomitable energy who ate sparingly and often got out of bed at 4:30 a.m. and who liked to supervise her dozens of projects herself and delegate as little as possible, Lady Ryder was gripped by the notion that she had a moral mission to help the less advantaged -- the poor, the sick, the displaced.         She had a religious view of suffering and grace, once telling an interviewer, ''I believe that to be with people who are suffering, whoever they are, makes one humble.''         Her name was familiar to the British public through the 500 or so Sue Ryder charity shops in cities and towns across the country. Sales from the stores, which volunteers run and sell both new and used goods, are used to raise money for the Sue Ryder Foundation, the group that runs the Sue Ryder centers. Lady Ryder bought her own clothes from the stores.         She first got an inkling of what would be her life's work as a girl in Leeds, when her mother took her on mercy missions to the poor in the woeful slums there. Born Margaret Susan Ryder in 1923 into a prosperous farming family outside Leeds, Sue, as she was called, was the youngest of her mother's five surviving children.         As the Depression ground on in the mid-1930's, the family fell on hard times and left the family home and moved to what had been a summer cottage in Thurlow, Suffolk.         Sue Ryder, who once thought that she would become a nun, married a young naval officer at 18. He was killed in the war several weeks later.         Lying about her age, she volunteered as a nurse and was soon sent to work at the Polish section of the Special Operations Executive, which ran spies and helped resistance organizations in enemy territory. Her work there gave her a lifelong sympathy for refugees and for prisoners and other casualties of war.         It also left her with an abiding admiration for Poland. She took the name of the country's capital as part of her title when she was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer in 1979.         After the war, she worked in camps for displaced persons and, among other activities, organized trips to British vacation houses for survivors of concentration camp. She also did relief work in France, meeting the practical problems she encountered with a typically stubborn belief in her abilities. Once, a truck that she was driving laden with stoves and drugs to combat tuberculosis and typhus broke down in midjourney. She pushed it to the side of the road with the help of passers-by and proceeded to clean the carburetor and replace the spark plugs herself before setting off again.         In 1953, she used a small inheritance and some borrowed money to found the Sue Ryder Foundation, whose symbol is rosemary, a sign of remembrance. The foundation was dedicated to the memory of those who had been killed in the two world wars.         Soon after, she opened the first Sue Ryder Home, for disabled people. By 1965, she had established 30 homes, where those bearing the scars of the war lived in comfort and without restriction, in England, Germany, Greece, Poland and Yugoslavia.         As Europe rebuilt itself after the war, Sue Ryder became a champion for the dispossessed. She traveled 50,000 miles a year, often driving, carrying supplies across the Continent, supervising the homebuilding and visiting refugees.         Through the years, Lady Ryder's organization continued to expand. There are now 20 homes in Britain and 80 centers in 20 countries around the world. In Britain, the organization has 2,500 employees.         There are residential centers and day-care centers that provide help for those with long-term illnesses and for those who need palliative care, and centers for people with neurological and degenerative diseases. Each year in Britain, 3,000 people are cared for at the residential centers, 12,000 visits are made to the day centers, and more than 37,000 home visits are made by the nursing staff.         In 1998, Lady Ryder retired as a trustee of the organization that she founded as a dispute about its future raged. She founded a new group, the Bouverie Foundation. The Sue Ryder Foundation has been renamed Sue Ryder Care, and it is being reorganized and modernized.         In 1959, Sue Ryder married Group Capt. Leonard Cheshire, a war hero and holder of the Victoria Cross. It was a true meeting of interests. Captain Cheshire, it happened, had his own charitable foundation, and he first met his future wife when she visited one of his homes for the disabled. Her husband. was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer in 1991. He died the next year. The couple had two children, Jeremy and Elizabeth, who survive.         In 1979, the Queen Mother opened the Sue Ryder Foundation Museum in Cavendish, with exhibitions that included Lady Ryder's war uniforms and a reconstruction of her mother's room. But Lady Ryder insisted that her work was about the people whom she helped rather than herself.         The museum, she said, was a tribute ''to all those who suffered and who continue to suffer.''         ''It is intended,'' she added, ''to show the misery in the world and the needs which exist more vividly than the written word could do. It is not dedicated to me.''       
         Ruth Mitchell, one of Broadway's best-known backstage bosses who parlayed her professional prowess and personal flair into a successful producing career, died on Friday in Manhattan. She was 81.         Ms. Mitchell hailed from the tough streets of Newark, and it showed in her decision to work as a stage manager, a thankless profession whose duties include everything from making sure that the actors' coffee is hot to untangling chorus girls involved in a dressing room brawl. In her own words, the only things Ms. Mitchell didn't have to worry about were ''singing the hit song or selling orange drink in the lobby.'' Everything else was in her bailiwick.         By all accounts, she was up to the job, acting as both strict taskmaster for her producers and an advocate for the actors in her shows, which included landmark American musicals like ''West Side Story,'' ''Gypsy,'' ''The King and I'' and ''Bells Are Ringing.''         Later, working with her longtime mentor, the director and producer Hal Prince, Ms. Mitchell also helped  produce ''Cabaret,'' ''Company'' and ''A Little Night Music,'' each of which won the Tony Award for best musical.         A theater fan from early childhood, Ms. Mitchell attended dance classes and subsequently spent several summers hoofing on the summer theater circuit. Her stage managing career began in 1943 while she was a chorus girl in a Shubert musical entitled ''Cocktails at 5.'' But the show was ''lousy,'' she said in a 1958 interview, so she took refuge as the second assistant stage manager.         Stage management quickly became her primary profession, and she soon found herself in charge of  shows with stars like Tallulah Bankhead, who once said that Ms. Mitchell would have been ''the most perfect person in the world if she could only play bridge.''         Although no longer a professional actress, Ms. Mitchell never lost her flair for the dramatic. A small brunette, she had a fondness for capes and mink and often wore them on her opening nights.         In 1949, she even took over a small role in the play ''Mister Roberts,'' with Henry Fonda, for a week when the actress playing the part went on vacation. And while Mr. Prince called her ''the chic-est stage manager on Broadway,'' Ms. Mitchell was also known to be able to out-curse the coarsest of stagehands.         Her dedication and care for detail quickly became legendary on Broadway. She kept, for example, a complete list of the best doctors in every major city on the East Coast in case actors got sick on the road, as well as a list of popular bars and restaurants.         On the opening night of ''She Loves Me'' in 1963, the curtain got stuck while rising during the overture. Ms. Mitchell, who was sitting in the audience in formal wear, climbed onstage to unhitch the curtain. She did, and the show, as they say, went on.         She is survived by her companion, Florence Klotz, and a sister, Juliette Fleischer, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.       
         Eleanor Naumburg Sanger, the first program director of WQXR, the classical music station that was later purchased by The New York Times Company, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.         Mrs. Sanger and her husband, Elliott M. Sanger, who helped found the station, assembled the music and interviews that turned WQXR, one of the country's first FM classical stations, into a New York institution. She came upon the job almost by accident: Called down to the station one day not long after it was founded in 1936 to help out with a deluge of mail, she stayed for 23 years.         During more than 20 years as program director, Mrs. Sanger oversaw the staff that selected the symphonies and operas for each day's broadcast, published a program guide, hired announcers, and arranged for live radio performances by many great musicians, including Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn.         Mrs. Sanger was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Sept. 20, 1900. She taught at the Ethical Culture Society School. Except for a brief period in Paris, she spent her entire life in Manhattan.         She and her husband stayed on at WQXR long after the Times Company purchased it in 1944. Mrs. Sanger helped transform the station into an outlet for reporting breaking news to The Times's readers in New York between the paper's daily editions.         Mrs. Sanger is survived by a son, Kenneth E. Sanger, of White Plains,  three grandchildren, and four great-grandsons.       
         Mary Hunter Wolf, one of the first female directors on Broadway, died Nov. 3 in Hamden, Conn. She was 95.         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., and orphaned as a teenager, Ms. Hunter (who took the name Wolf after marrying Herman Wolf in 1955) discovered her love of the theater while a student at the Hollywood School for Girls. There she formed a lifelong friendship with the choreographer Agnes de Mille, a classmate.         She spent the summer after graduation working as a script girl for de Mille's father, William, at Laske Studios before heading to Wellesley College. During her third year at Wellesley, she visited her aunt, the writer Mary Austin, in Santa Fe, N.M., where she was introduced into the circle of D. H. Lawrence, Lynn Riggs, Sinclair Lewis and Willa Cather, whom she chauffeured around while Cather wrote ''Death Comes for the Archbishop.''         She soon abandoned her studies to forge a directing career, beginning with a staging of a 17th-century Spanish verse play, ''Los Morros y los Cristianos,'' performed on horseback. In 1928, she moved to Chicago, where she enrolled at the University of Chicago and started working with the Cube Theater, the first interracial company in Chicago. Once again, she dropped out of college to take over the theater, directing such plays as ''The Dreamy Kid,'' ''The Man Who Died at 12:00'' and ''Plumes,'' in which Katherine Dunham made her dramatic debut.         In 1931, she won the part of Marge on the WGN radio comedy ''Easy Aces.'' Two years later, she moved with the show to New York, where it was broadcast on CBS until 1945, and resumed her college studies, earning a degree in anthropology from Columbia University.         In 1938, Ms. Hunter and a Stanislavsky student, Andrius Jilinsky, founded the American Actors Company, an early Off Broadway ensemble whose members included de Mille, Jerome Robbins, Mildred Dunnock, Horton Foote, Joseph Anthony, Perry Wilson and Jean Stapleton.         ''Mary was largely instrumental in getting me interested in playwriting and was kind of my mentor,'' Mr. Foote said Friday.         ''I was doing some improvisation about Texas, and she asked me if I had ever thought about writing, which I hadn't,'' he recalled. ''And so, at her urging, I put some things down on paper, and it sort of went from there.''         Ms. Hunter made her Broadway debut directing the 1944 production of Mr. Foote's ''Only the Heart.'' The next year, she directed ''Carib Song,'' the first black Broadway musical, starring Dunham. She went on to direct Riggs's ''Out of Dust,'' John LaTouche and Jerome Moross's ''Ballet Ballads'' and a successful run of Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Respectful Prostitute,'' both on Broadway and on tour. Alongside her close friend Robbins, she was associate director of ''Peter Pan,'' starring Mary Martin.         In 1947, Ms. Hunter was hired to direct a new Broadway musical, ''High Button Shoes,'' but the show's producers dismissed her before rehearsals began, replacing her with George Abbott. She sued, arguing that her contract had been canceled because she was a woman. Two years later the New York Supreme Court decided in her favor.         At the close of World War II, Ms. Hunter established the Professional Training Program of the American Theater Wing, under which 1,700 students studied under the G.I. Bill of Rights. In 1952 she helped Lawrence Langner found the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., serving first as executive director and later as associate producer.         She and Mr. Wolf were divorced in 1965. He survives her, as do two stepsons, David Wolf of Ridgefield, Wash., and Bill Wolf of New Castle, Va.; a stepdaughter, Louise Chandler of Sweet Springs, W.Va.; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson.       
         Marie Windsor, who played sassy femmes fatales, cynical bawdyhouse matrons and two-timing crooks in 74 movies with enough verve to win the informal accolade ''Queen of the B's,'' died on Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Acting opposite male stars like Marlon Brando, George Raft, James Garner and John Wayne, she portrayed a succession of strong, but seldom admirable characters: she was the blunt, beautiful dame with the bedroom eyes who was rotten to the core and didn't care who knew it.         ''I know you like a book, ya little tramp,'' Sterling Hayden said to her in the 1956 film ''The Killing,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick.''You'd sell out your own mother for a piece of fudge.''         In ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), she played a sexy gangster's widow who ends up riding across the country by rail with a police escort played by Charles McGraw. ''She's a dish,'' he tells his partner, ''a 60-cent special: cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy.''         Later, he tells her, ''You make me sick to my stomach.''         ''Yeah?'' she snarls. ''Well, use your own sink.''         She also made guest appearances on more than 100 television shows, including ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her film career spanned five decades, and included film noir classics like ''Force of Evil'' (1948) and westerns like ''The Fighting Kentuckian'' (1949), with Mr. Wayne. But she also had no qualms about appearing in quickie efforts like ''Cat Women of the Moon'' (1954), ''Swamp Women'' (1955) and ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955). ''I think those films added to my luster,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I think people said, 'She can even do that and survive.' ''         She came to take pride in the title Queen of the B's. As she said in several different interviews over the years, ''It's better to be queen of something than nothing at all.''         Emily Marie Bertelsen was born on Dec. 11, 1919, in Marysvale, Utah, a small farming community where her father was a mechanic. Her grandmother took her to see films with Clara Bow, the ''It Girl,'' as a child. By the time she was 11, her parents drove 30 miles over dirt roads to take her to acting lessons.         After she won two local beauty pageants and studied drama for two years at Brigham Young University, her parents drove her to Hollywood to study with Maria Ouspenskaya, the famed acting instructor. She stayed at the Hollywood Studio Club,  whose residents included Marilyn Monroe and Donna Reed. She worked as a cigarette girl at the Mocambo, a Sunset Strip nightclub.         In 1941 she made her movie debut in Paramount's ''All-American Coed,'' wearing a costume of velvet carrots. After appearing in some bit parts, she headed for New York, where she was cast in more than 400 radio shows, including a nine-month stint on the soap opera ''Our Gal Sunday,'' from 1943 to 1945. During her last year in New York, she played the femme heavy in the Broadway play ''Follow the Girls.''         MGM then signed her to a contract, though she did lesser roles for many other studios, including some very small ones, through the 1950's.         ''A lot of things hampered my career,'' she said in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle in 1994. ''At 5 foot 9, I was too tall for most leading men. And I never had a classic face. One of my casting directors at Paramount said about me, before I'd even started my career, 'Her eyes are too big and she has a bad mouth.' ''         The Chronicle quoted Frances Bergen, the mother of Candice and a long-time friend, as suggesting that Ms. Windsor's striking resemblance to Joan Crawford might have obscured her during Crawford's heyday. But Ms. Windsor found a niche in film noir, a genre of mainly crime thrillers that captured a sense of postwar disillusionment. In ''Force of Evil,'' she played Roy Roberts's sultry, promiscuous wife in a tale about the numbers racket. For the first time, she received featured billing and was pictured in the advertising. She once said in an interview: ''I didn't know I was doing film noir, I thought they were detective stories with low lighting! Even Kubrick, in  'The Killing,' never used the term film noir to my knowledge.''         Perhaps her best remembered role was in the low-budget ''The Narrow Margin,'' in which she played a sexy gangster's wife with a heart of gravel. That role spurred Kubrick to cast her as an unfaithful wife in ''The Killing,'' for which she won the best supporting actress award from Look.         ''One of the reasons film noir is so popular today is that it left so much to the imagination, in contrast to today when everything is so explicit,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''Film noir engaged the audience, let them use the gray matter between their ears.''         Ms. Windsor is survived by her husband, Jack Rodney Hupp; her son, Richard Hupp; a brother, Jerry Bertelsen; and a sister, Louise Atherley.         She was a director of the Screen Actors Guild for 25 years, and was aligned with the union's conservative wing, represented by Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston. But many conservative movie viewers might be hard pressed to believe it. Her characters were just so radically evil.         She told Classic Images, a film magazine: ''Fans would send me Bibles with specific verses underscored and accompanied by handwritten warnings that 'the devil would get me and I'd go to hell,' if I didn't reform.''       
         Christabel Leighton-Porter, who became the sweetheart of British troops in World War II as the model for a comic strip heroine who was forever shedding her clothes, died Dec. 6 in Horsham, England. She was 87.         While American troops ogled pinups of Betty Grable and the Varga girls of Esquire magazine, British soldiers, sailors and airmen went to war inspired by The Daily Mirror's comic strip ''Jane.''         Six days a week, Jane, a curvaceous blonde secret agent -- Mrs. Leighton-Porter as drawn by Norman Pett -- found herself in madcap escapades. Jane tangled with Nazi spies, tumbled down cliffs and became caught in tree branches in episodes that invariably concluded with her stripped down to her underclothes.         When she was not posing as Jane, Mrs. Leighton-Porter traveled around England in a chorus-girl show, ''Jane in The Mirror,'' entertaining servicemen and bucking up home front morale.         ''Suddenly I became a sweetheart all over the world,'' she recalled. ''One admiral told me that there wasn't anybody on the ships, from the lowest rating to the highest in the fleet, who didn't have a drawing of Jane in his pocket or on his bunk.''         Christabel Jane Drewry was born on April 11, 1913, in Eastleigh, England; her father worked at the town carriage works. In her late teens, she became an artist's model, and in 1939 she was acclaimed Britain's Perfect Girl in a beauty pageant at the London Palladium.         She was discovered by Mr. Pett while modeling at an art school in Birmingham, where she also worked as a telephone operator. Mr. Pett had been drawing for The Daily Mirror since 1932, when he created ''Jane's Journal: The Diary of a Bright Young Thing,'' using his wife, Mary, as a model. But Mrs. Pett grew interested in golf as the years passed and the newspaper became interested in a Jane who revealed some flesh.         When Britain went to war in 1939, Mrs. Leighton-Porter's Jane began to lose her garments and the comic strip began to gain a huge audience on the fighting fronts. Bomber crews painted Jane on Lancaster fuselages, submarines went to war with weeks of her advance comic panels stored away, and tank crews plastered Jane's undraped likeness on their turrets. Churchill is said to have cited Jane's morale-boosting as Britain's secret weapon.         Jane finally shed every stitch of her clothing in a September 1944 episode. The Daily Mirror reported that a British infantry division was so inspired that it advanced six miles in France the very next day.         Notwithstanding her achievements in the war effort, Mrs. Leighton-Porter had to negotiate with the lord chamberlain, the court official responsible for censoring stage shows, when she made her stage appearances in scanty outfits. ''They were never offensive,'' she said of those shows. ''I was very modest.''         Jane received numerous marriage proposals, but the smitten soldiers  did not know that the real Jane was married, something Mrs. Leighton-Porter kept secret so as not to disappoint her fans. Her husband, Arthur, was a Royal Air Force pilot.         Mrs. Leighton-Porter continued modeling for ''Jane'' after the war, and when Mr. Pett left The Daily Mirror in 1948, the drawings were taken over by his assistant, Michael Hubbard. The next year, Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared in the British movie ''The Adventures of Jane.''         The comic strip continued until 1959, when Jane sailed into the sunset with her boyfriend, Georgie Porgie. Mrs. Leighton-Porter settled into family life in Bermuda and in England, turning to more staid endeavors like sponsoring teas for a cricket team in Horsham.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Simon.         Neither Jane nor Mrs. Leighton-Porter was forgotten. The BBC developed a television show based on the ''Jane'' comic strip in the early 1980's, and Mrs. Leighton-Porter appeared at servicemen's reunions. In 1993, the Imperial War Museum displayed her 1940's frilly knickers in its exhibition ''Forces Sweethearts,'' the story of wartime romance from World War I to the gulf war. In June 1994, Mrs. Leighton-Porter attended ceremonies observing the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.         When she reflected on the comic strip's popularity, Mrs. Leighton-Porter chose not to dwell on the risque. ''I think it was because Jane was a bit girl-next-doorish, a bit of England for the boys,'' she said. ''Jane became a cult thing really, and I think wives and girlfriends were glad that their boys had something to get a kick out of.''       
         Rosemarie Kanzler, who rose from humble beginnings in the Swiss Alps to become one of the most glamorous figures in the international set for more than five decades, died Dec. 9 at her estate in Argentina. She was 85. Her butler found her in her swimming pool after she had suffered a stroke, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Kanzler, who was married five times, was said to have made the original introductions that led to several famous marriages. Henry Ford II met his second wife, the Italian-born Cristina Vettore Austin, at one of Mrs. Kanzler's homes. Mr. Ford's daughter, Charlotte Ford, met Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon whom she later married, at the Kanzler residence in St. Moritz. Over her lifetime, Mrs. Kanzler decorated and lived in 23 residences throughout the world.         Mrs. Kanzler was also credited with introducing Henry Fonda to his third wife, Countess Afdera Franchetti, and Oscar de la Renta to Francoise de Langlade, his first wife.         Born in Zurich on Jan. 24, 1915, to Giovanni Ravelli, an Italian construction worker, and his German wife, Rosemarie Ravelli was in her early 20's when she left Switzerland with Peter Kreuder, a German theater and film composer. Intent on a singing career, she joined Mr. Kreuder's traveling troupe of entertainers but within several years fled Europe.         She landed in Cuba and soon went on to Mexico City, where in 1944 she married Manuel Reachi, a film producer. They were divorced in 1948, and she moved on to Hollywood, Paris and the South of France. In 1953 she married Carlos Oriani, a Mexican entrepreneur. They were divorced the next year.         Within months she was married again, to Frederick Weicker, an uncle of the former Connecticut governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and an heir to the Squibb pharmaceutical empire. She was a widow four months later when Mr. Weicker died at his fishing camp. In 1955 she married Ernest Kanzler, a Detroit business executive who was head of the War Production Board during World War II. Mr. Kanzler, who died in 1967 and was an uncle by marriage of Henry Ford, was associated with the Ford company and was a director of the Detroit Lions football team.         A 1973 marriage to Jean Pierre Marcie-Riviere, a French banker, ended in divorce in 1989. Mrs. Kanzler went back to using the name of her fourth husband and will be buried next to him in Detroit.         Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Katrina Maxtone-Graham of Manhattan; a stepson, Ernest Kanzler Jr., of Arizona; and eight step-grandchildren.         ''I always knew what I wanted and figured out a way to get it,'' she told Kathryn Livingston, a New York writer who collaborated on her memoir, ''Yesterday Is Gone,'' recently published in Germany. But, she added, destiny also played a part, and it was important to know when to end a chapter, buy an airline ticket and get out and start a new life.         ''I always had a good nose for timing changes,'' she said.       
         Peggy McMartin Buckey, a principal defendant in the Virginia McMartin Pre-School child-molestation case, who went free after a costly seven-year ordeal when prosecutors gave up, died on Friday in Torrance, Calif. She was 74 and lived in Torrance.         The local authorities said Mrs. Buckey was found unconscious in her home and was pronounced dead at a hospital.         Mrs. Buckey was the main administrator of the school that her family operated in Manhattan Beach, a Los Angeles suburb. The case turned into a legal and emotional crucible for her, her son and daughter, her mother and three teachers, as well as the accusing parents.         It started in August 1983 when a mother called the police to say that her 2 1/2-year-old son had been molested at the school.         In a case that many found reminiscent of the witchcraft trials of yore, the ensuing investigation soon received lurid reports of children being raped and sodomized, of dead rabbits, satanic rites and drinking blood. Eventually the case went through two trials, the last ending with a hung jury. The prosecution cost Los Angeles County at least $15 million.         On the basis of testimony from children and doctors but little corroborating evidence, a grand jury in March 1984 indicted Mrs. Buckey; her son, Raymond; her daughter, Peggy Ann Buckey; her mother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the school; and three teachers. After a lengthy preliminary hearing, the trial judge in January 1986 ordered all seven to stand trial on a total of 135 counts of molesting 14 children.         Days later, even the prosecution termed the evidence against all but Mrs. Buckey and her son ''incredibly weak.'' The charges against the five other defendants were dropped.         Mrs. Buckey and Raymond Buckey first went to trial in April 1987. Two years later the county jury voted acquittals on some charges and deadlocked on others. A second trial of Mr. Buckey alone ended in a hung jury, after which prosecutors chose to drop the matter.         ''I've gone through hell,'' Mrs. Buckey said at the time, ''and now we've lost everything.'' By then she had spent two years behind bars before raising bail and her son had spent five.         The case came to symbolize the hazards in abuse investigations.         Experts in the field held that children's accounts of abuse tended to have a basis of truth because they had no reason to invent such events.         But in the McMartin case and others like it, critics contended, zealous prosecutors and poorly trained social workers, faced with anxious parents, may unknowingly coach children to tell stories of abuse or embroider on them.         Mrs. Buckey's survivors include her husband, Charles, and her son and daughter. Her mother, Virginia McMartin, died in 1995.       
         Florynce Kennedy, a lawyer and political activist whose flamboyant attire and sometimes outrageous comments drew attention to her fierce struggle for civil rights and feminism, died on Thursday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Known to everyone as Flo, recognizable everywhere in cowboy hat and pink sunglasses, she was one of the first black women to graduate from Columbia Law School, where she was admitted after threatening a discrimination suit. She fought in the courts and on the streets for abortion rights, represented Black Panthers, was a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and led a mass urination by women protesting a lack of women's restrooms at Harvard.         ''If you found a cause for the downtrodden of somebody being abused someplace, by God, Flo Kennedy would be there,'' former Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said yesterday.         People magazine in 1974 called her ''the biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground where feminist activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause.''         Justice Emily Jane Goodman of New York State Supreme Court said Ms. Kennedy gave women courage. ''She showed a whole generation of us the right way to live our lives,'' Justice Goodman said.         Friends like Gloria Steinem reveled in her razor-sharp wit. Ms. Steinem, who lectured with Ms. Kennedy in the 1970's, said a man in the audience would all too often stand up and demand, ''Are you lesbians?''         Ms. Kennedy would respond that it depended. ''Are you my alternative?'' she would ask.         Ms. Steinem said by phone from Hawaii yesterday, ''She understood what Emma Goldman understood: there has to be laughter and fun at the revolution, or it isn't a revolution.''         Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, yesterday called Ms. Kennedy ''one of the most wonderfully outrageous pioneers of feminism in America.''         Florynce Rae Kennedy, the second of five daughters, was born on Feb. 11, 1916, in Kansas City, Mo. Her father was a Pullman porter and later owned a taxi business. He once stood up with a shotgun to members of the Ku Klux Klan who wanted to drive him from a home he had bought in a mainly white neighborhood.         In her autobiography, ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'' (1976), she said her parents almost never criticized their daughters. In fact, they could seemingly do almost no wrong. ''We were taught very early in the game that we didn't have to respect the teachers, and if they threatened to hit us, we could act as if they weren't anybody we had to pay any attention to,'' she wrote.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Kennedy opened a hat shop in Kansas City with her sisters. Within a few years, she was involved in her first political protest, helping organize a boycott when the local Coca-Cola bottler refused to hire black truck drivers.         After the death of her mother, Zella, from cancer, Ms. Kennedy and her sister Grayce moved to New York. Ignoring those who urged her to become a teacher, she enrolled in pre-law courses at Columbia University. ''I find that the higher you aim, the better you shoot,'' she wrote.         She applied to Columbia Law School, but was refused admission. She was told the reason was not that she was black, but that she was a woman. Justice Goodman said she answered, ''To my friends at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, it all sounds the same.''         After threatening a lawsuit, Ms. Kennedy was admitted. She was one of eight women and the only black in her class. She graduated in 1951 and worked briefly for a Manhattan law firm before opening her own law office in 1954. Business was not good, and she had to take a job at Bloomingdale's one Christmas to pay the rent.         One of her cases involved representing the estates of the jazz greats Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker to recover money owed them by record companies. Even though she won the cases, the experience soured her on the law.         ''Handling the Holiday and Parker estates taught me more than I was really ready for about government and business delinquency and the hostility and helplessness of the courts,'' she wrote. ''Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practicing law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.''         She turned to political activism, setting up an organization called the Media Workshop in 1966 to fight racism in journalism and advertising. Picketing an advertising agency led to the protesters' being invited upstairs to state their case. She said, ''Ever since I've been able to say, 'When you want to get to the suites, start in the streets.' ''         Her strategy became to go after the biggest targets possible. ''Grass-roots organizing is like climbing into bed with a malaria patient in order to show how much you love him or her, then catching malaria yourself,'' she wrote. ''I say if you want to kill poverty, go to Wall Street and kick -- or disrupt.''         Increasingly, her legal cases were almost always political. ''Sweetie,'' she said, ''if you're not living on the edge, then you're taking up space.''         In 1966, she represented H. Rap Brown, the civil rights leader. In 1968, she sued the Roman Catholic Church for what she viewed as interference with abortion. In 1969, she organized a group of feminist lawyers to challenge the constitutionality of New York State's abortion law, an action credited with helping influence the Legislature to liberalize abortion the next year.         In 1969, she helped represent 21 Black Panthers on trial in Manhattan for conspiracy to commit bombings, among other things. They were eventually acquitted, but during the trial she used them for another purpose.         She and Ms. Goodman, not then a judge, and others were renting a house on Fire Island. They decided to take the Panthers to a community on the island for a dinner at a restaurant that did not accept blacks or Jews. It created quite a commotion, the intended effect. But afterward, Ms. Goodman asked if it was all that important, compared with the life and death issues at stake in the trial.         Ms. Kennedy gave an emphatic yes. ''Her point was that you have to fight on all the fronts all the time,'' Justice Goodman said.         Other fronts included founding the Feminist Party in 1971. Its first act was to nominate Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of New York, for president.         In 1967, Ms. Kennedy attended a rally against the Vietnam War in Montreal. Bobby Seale, the Black Panther, was not allowed to speak. ''I went berserk,'' she wrote. ''I took the platform and started yelling and hollering.'' An invitation for Ms. Kennedy to speak in Washington followed, and a 20-year lecturing career was born. She made $3,500 a lecture at her peak.         Ms. Steinem called her lectures with Ms. Kennedy on the college circuit ''the Thelma and Louise of the 70's.'' Ms. Steinem said, ''I definitely speak first because after Flo I would have been an anticlimax.''         In 1957, Ms. Kennedy married Charles Dye, a writer 10 years her junior. He died a few years later. ''Anyone who marries a drunk Welshman doesn't deserve sympathy,'' she once said.         Her views on the exclusivity of marriage were not much brighter. ''Why would you lock yourself in the bathroom just because you have to go three times a day,'' she wrote.         Ms. Kennedy is survived by three sisters, Joy Kennedy Banks of East Orange, N.J., Faye Kennedy Daly of Honolulu and Grayce Kennedy Bayles of Queens.         As her health failed, her spirit did not. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stopped to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.''       
         Lily Carlson Schulte, one of the first models hired by the Ford agency and a favorite subject of photographers like Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, died on Dec. 14 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 85.         ''It's hard to explain to you what a star she was,'' said Eileen Ford, the agency's co-founder. ''Every great photographer wanted to work with her. In this business, there certainly has never been a bigger star. ''         Lily Carlson, as she was known professionally, stood 5 feet 11 inches tall. She stood out in a crowd, even of other models. She is the woman in the center of Irving Penn's famous photograph of the 12 most photographed women of the 1940's. She wears a white gown with a billowing skirt and gazes slightly upward.         Her face was more famous than her name, perhaps, but she was always famous to her photographers. George Hurrell, a distinguished fashion photographer, called her one of the three most beautiful women he ever photographed. The others were Joan Crawford and his wife, Phyllis Bounds, also a model. He called Miss Carlson ''perhaps the best fashion model in the entire country.''         In an interview in Cover Girl magazine, Mr. Hurrell said that some models are wooden and tend to simper, but that Miss Carlson was alive and vital. ''Equally good in sports clothes or evening gowns,'' he said.         She came along just as the whole business of modeling changed, Mrs. Ford said. In the immediate post-war years, models became the elegant emblems of a newly booming haute couture fashion business, perhaps epitomized by Christian Dior's romantic New Look of 1947. There was an explosion of photography, and models like Lisa Fonssagrives, famously photographed at the Eiffel Tower with her skirts billowing, elevated the model's role far beyond that of simple clothes hangers.         ''It was like a land rush,'' said Mrs. Ford, who with her husband, Jerry, opened Ford Models in 1946. They had hired only a couple of lesser-known models when Miss Carlson agreed to sign on. ''She was our seal of approval, the first really, really great star,'' said Mrs. Ford. (Her agency agreed this month to be bought by Magnum Sports Entertainment.)         Lily Viola Carlson was born in Sheridan, Iowa, on April 4, 1915, Easter Sunday. ''It was Bunny or Lily,'' said her daughter Christina Fleur, ''and they called her Lily. Thank goodness.''         Her father was a Lutheran minister who frequently conducted services in Swedish. Her son, William Dowell, said she hated both the plains and the plainness of the Midwest, greedily devouring The New Yorker magazine as if it were ''an escape manual.''         She attended the Art Institute of Chicago, specializing in watercolors and photography. She followed a fellow student, Julian C. Dowell, to New York and married him. Their honeymoon consisted of a nickel ride on the Fifth Avenue bus. They and their friends would hold spaghetti parties to which each person would bring a can of pasta to throw into the kettle.         With Mr. Dowell unemployed at the depths of the Depression, his wife looked in the mirror and saw what just might be a bankable asset. She flipped through a directory of fashion photographers and under the B's, spotted one named Erwin Blumenfeld. He shot some test pictures and sent them to Vogue, and Miss Carlson went to work.         ''It was so amazing,'' she later told Cover Girl. ''The first 28 days, I made $1,500,'' the equivalent of about $13,500 in today's money.         Mr. Blumenfeld said this was not all good news. He told her the pressures of the stratospheric career she could easily have might damage her marriage. Mr. Dowell, who envisioned her as a movie star, said she must do it, their son, William, said.         Soon they were living in different worlds. She was a regular at the Stork Club in a veiled hat and white gloves, while he found work as an art director. He moved to the suburbs, she stayed in Manhattan, and they were divorced.         She had not started modeling until her late 20's, but she quickly became a regular in both the fashion and general press. A picture in Life showed her striding down Park Avenue carrying a hatbox, then ''the symbol of the model's trade,'' as the caption read. An Avedon photograph in Vogue showed her ''wrapped in a cloud of red fox against black.''         She sometimes veered beyond fashion, once escorting a sheep around the country for a wool dealers' group. She was the Drene Girl, showing off her voluminous hair for Drene shampoo.         To enliven her expression, she always conversed with an imaginary friend as she was photographed. ''That way I just naturally warm up,'' she said.         Cover Girl reported, ''Photographers with whom Lily works tease her about this. 'Well, Lily,' they say, 'who will it be today . . . Julian, Joe or John?' '' Mrs. Ford said this is wrong. It was always John. She has no idea why.         In 1955, Miss Carlson married David A. Schulte, a financier who advised presidents on employment policy and still serves on the New York City Board of Corrections. Her new affluence allowed her to leave modeling and spend more time taking pictures herself. Her work appeared in Life, Look and other magazines.         The two would have been jet-setters had they not preferred the staterooms of luxury ocean liners. They spent almost half their lives in Europe, always staying at the Cipriani in Venice, the Ritz in Paris. At the Ritz several years ago, Mrs. Schulte spotted Richard Avedon and shyly approached to ask if he remembered her. He did.         But her son described a woman who furnished her elegant apartment with things she bought at flea markets.         In addition to her husband, her son and her daughter Christina, she is survived by another daughter, Holly Schulte Ellison, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.         At her funeral on Monday, there were mountains of white roses and white lilies. Ms. Fleur told of the time at age 8 or 9 that she was caught with her mother in a downpour. Yellow cabs were whizzing by, but you would have had a better chance of catching a snowball somewhere very hot. Suddenly, a cab screeched to a stop directly in front of Miss Carlson.         ''I saw you standing there,'' the driver said.       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.
