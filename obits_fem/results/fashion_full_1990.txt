        Lilly Dache, the milliner who flourished in this country in the decades when women selected their new hats before they chose their new clothes, died Sunday at a nursing home in Louvecienne, France. She was 97 years old.         Lilly Dache, the milliner who flourished in this country in the decades when women selected their new hats before they chose their new clothes, died Sunday at a nursing home in Louvecienne, France. She was 97 years old.         She was best known for her turbans, which she made by draping the fabric right on her customers' heads.         ''I would talk to the woman, ask her where she planned to wear the hat, what kind of dress she would wear it with,'' she told an interviewer at the end of her career. ''If she thought her nose was too long, I would make a hat with a brim and pull it down so you couldn't see the nose so much. I made everything with love, affection and excitement.''         Customers Included Film Stars         Her clients included Hollywood stars like Sonja Henie, Audrey Hepburn, Carole Lombard and Marlene Dietrich. Her last customer was Loretta Young, who arrived at her studio after Miss Dache decided to retire and bought her last 30 hats.         That was in 1968. Miss Dache's husband, Jean Despres, an executive at Coty Inc., the fragrance and cosmetics house, was retiring and she decided to close her business. Until his death last year, she and her husband divided their time between Delray Beach, Fla., and Meudon, France.         She had come to this country from France at the age of 16 and lived with an uncle in Atlantic City at first. But she soon went to New York, saw a sign in a window on a shop on Broadway saying ''Milliner Wanted'' and got the job.         She and another woman working there eventually bought the shop from the owner. She remembered the first hat she made as her own boss: a turban in four shades of blue, made from scraps lying in the shop.         A Leader in Fashion World         She was part of a group of milliners who were better known at the time than dress designers. They included John-Fredericks, Walter Florell, Laddie Northridge and Sally Victor.         In the 1930's depression era, women with limited funds tended to buy new hats instead of new clothes. In the 1940's clothing fabric was in restricted supply because of World War II, and hats continued in demand because they were showy.         But Miss Dache saw that millinery might not continue in fashion indefinitely, so she developed snoods with flowers, veils and bows as alternatives.         At the end of the 1950's she hired a young assistant from Chicago, Halston Frowick, who went on to become known for his own line of clothes. She also hired Kenneth Battell to take charge of her hair salon. By the 1960's elaborate coiffures by Kenneth, as he was known, swept hats off the fashion map.         Miss Dache did not mourn the end of the millinery era. After her retirement, she rarely wore a hat; she preferred wigs.         She is survived by her daughter, Suzanne Dache-Gould, who also became a milliner, and two grandsons. A funeral service will be held in Meudon on Thursday.       
        Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jones instructed young women in charm, beauty and fitness as the owner-operator of the Candy Jones Career Girls School for more than 20 years. Later she and her husband, Long John Nebel, were co-hosts in Manhattan on a late-night talk and interview show, first on Radio Station WOR and then on WMCA. When Mr. Nebel died in 1978, she continued the all-night show until last year.         Candy Jones was born Jessica Arline Wilcox in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and educated in Atlantic City, where she won a beauty pageant at the age of 16. A trip to Manhattan followed, as did a modeling career and small roles in such 1940's Broadway musicals as ''Mexican Hayride'' and ''Polonaise.'' In World War II she headed a U.S.O. troupe called Cover Girls Abroad that entertained troops in the South Pacific.         Author of a Dozen Books         Tall, blond and with blue eyes, she gave beauty advice to women in more than a dozen books, including ''Make Your Name in Modeling and Television,'' ''Finishing Touches,'' ''Look Your Best,'' ''Between Us Girls'' and ''Candy Jones' Complete Book of Beauty and Fashion.'' Graduates of her school included Julia Meade and Sandra Dee.         In radio and television, Miss Jones was the hostess of several daytime talk and interview programs and took part in commercials as a performer, teacher and consultant. She also judged and advised beauty pageants and fashion shows around the country and lectured at colleges.         Before her marriage to Mr. Nebel, Miss Jones was married to Harry S. Conover, a model agency chief. The marriage ended in divorce.         Surviving are two sons, Harry Conover of Sudbury, Mass., and Carey Conover of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President       
        Jean Wallace, a screen actress who had feature parts in a dozen Hollywood productions and was married to two stars, Franchot Tone and Cornel Wilde, died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage Wednesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 66 years old.         Jean Wallace, a screen actress who had feature parts in a dozen Hollywood productions and was married to two stars, Franchot Tone and Cornel Wilde, died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage Wednesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 66 years old.         Among Miss Wallace's films, most of which were made in the 1940's and 1950's, were ''You Can't Ration Love,'' ''Song of India,'' ''Maracaibo'' and ''Lancelot and Guinevere.''         Miss Wallace, born Jean Walasek in Chicago, was a fashion model in her teens and went to Hollywood to get into pictures.         Rescued by Paramount         Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer gave her a part in a Hedy Lamarr feature, ''Ziegfeld Girl,'' but dropped her upon learning that she was not 19 years old, as she had said she was, but 17, which meant that under state law she could work only four hours a day and had to have a tutor.         Paramount gave her a six-month contract, complete with tutor. She was given a bit part in the 1941 musical ''Louisiana Purchase.'' By then she had become a protegee of Franchot Tone, who at 36 was twice her age, and in October 1941 she and the actor eloped to Yuma, Ariz., and were married.         The marriage lasted seven years, during which the couple had two sons, whose custody was awarded to Mr. Tone when they were divorced.         In 1949, after a visit with the chldren, Miss Wallace stabbed herself in the abdomen with a kitchen knife, but quickly recovered.         Early in 1950 she was married to James Randall, a soldier she had met while on a hospital tour. The marriage was annulled after five months. She married Cornel Wilde in 1951 and appeared in several movies made by Theodora Productions, a company she and Mr. Wilde created. They were divorced in 1981.         Miss Wallace is survived by three sons, Pascal Tone of Hamilton, Mass.; Thomas Tone of Ottawa, and Cornel Wallace Wilde of Beverly Hills, a brother, John Wallace of Los Angeles, a sister, Karol Crawford of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.

She is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth Pimberman and Susan Telcher of Manhattan; a sister, Elaine Cramer, and a brother, Robert Cramer, also of Manhattan, and another brother, Walter Cramer, of Niles, Ill.         Correction:  March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary yesterday about Terry Quimby, a former advertising executive in the fashion industry, misidentified a surviving daughter. She is Elizabeth Timberman, not Pimberman. The obituary also misstated the day of her death. It was Saturday, not Friday.       
        Josephine Blair Hughes, a super-saleswoman who sold high-fashion clothes to socially prominent women for four decades, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been bedridden for several years.         Josephine Blair Hughes, a super-saleswoman who sold high-fashion clothes to socially prominent women for four decades, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been bedridden for several years.         ''Jo Hughes was a dynamo, with the most fiercely loyal customers,'' said Lynn Manulis, president of Martha, where Miss Hughes spent the last seven years of her working life. ''Her girls, as she called them, wouldn't buy anything without her there to help and advise them.''         During her career, Jo Hughes worked at Hattie Carnegie, de Pinna, Bergdorf Goodman and Martha, as well as running her own shop for a time in a townhouse on East 56th Street.         Staged Fashion Shows         At Hattie Carnegie in the 1940's, she headed a department called Jeune Fille for 10 years, staging formal fashion shows each season. She continued the tradition of fashion shows, usually as charity benefits, when she went to Bergdorf Goodman in 1966, attracting customers like Doris Duke, Mary Lou Whitney and Mary Wells Lawrence.         ''All the important people came to her shows,'' recalled Andrew Goodman, the former owner of Bergdorf's. ''She had a volatile temper. She'd stop the show if someone was talking. But she was very good to her customers. If someone in Great Neck or somewhere had ordered a dress and needed it for a special party, she'd take a car and deliver it personally.''         Accompanied by a Dog         She was a familiar figure at designers' fashion shows, sitting in the front row with her Shih Tzu Tony on her lap. The dog went everywhere with her, friends recalled yesterday, even to restaurants like La Cote Basque and ''21,'' where he was checked in the coatroom.         Miss Hughes, who was born in Dallas, retired from Bergdorf's in 1978, then went back to work at Martha's in the early 80's until her health failed.         There are no survivors.

        Evelyn Dawson Winn, who as ''Suzy Perette'' designed women's clothes in the 1950's and early 1960's, died of a heart attack on Monday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. She was 81 years old and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.         Evelyn Dawson Winn, who as ''Suzy Perette'' designed women's clothes in the 1950's and early 1960's, died of a heart attack on Monday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. She was 81 years old and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.         Mrs. Winn, a native of Weehawken, N.J., started her career in the fashion industry in the 1930's. In 1949 she began designing moderate-priced women's clothing under the ''Suzy Perette'' label.         She retired as ''Suzy Perette'' in 1963 and a year later opened a dress shop at 19 West 57th Street carrying custom and ready-to-wear fashions of her own design. The shop closed in 1967.         Her first marriage, to James Fitzsimmins, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, Lawrence Winn.       
        Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Miss Goddard, a Hollywood star of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, was also publicized for her friendships with many notable figures; her marriages to Charles Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque, and her glamorous life style.         The actress, a former fashion model and showgirl, made her first major screen appearance in 1936 as a waterfront waif befriended by a forsaken assembly-line worker (played by Chaplin) in ''Modern Times,'' the last silent comedy feature.         Hollywood quickly took notice, and Miss Goddard earned leading comedy roles as an adventuress in ''The Young in Heart,'' as a battling wife seeking a Reno divorce in ''The Women,'' and as Bob Hope's pert romantic foil in ''The Cat and the Canary'' and ''The Ghost Breakers.''         Other early roles included a put-upon laundress in Mr. Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' (1940); Fred Astaire's partner in ''Second Chorus'' (1941), in which she gamely struggled to keep up with him in the dance ''I Ain't Hep to That Step, But I'll Dig It,'' and a lusty Southern belle singing a suggestive sea chanty to a party of prudes in the 1942 adventure ''Reap the Wild Wind.''         Runner-Up for Scarlett         The last of these roles was a consolation prize for the major disappointment of her acting career: losing the coveted part of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh in the final round of the ''Gone With the Wind'' competition. At the time Miss Goddard said she ''cried her eyes out,'' but years later she said she recalled the episode as only ''like a game.''         Miss Goddard, an energetic and articulate woman, was a close friend of a wide range of artists, including the composer George Gershwin, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and the artist Andy Warhol. She was wealthy, both from her Hollywood salaries and her husbands, but in later years she sold many costly artworks at auction, including her collection of Impressionist art, which was sold in 1979 for $2.9 million.         At the time, she said her reason for selling was no secret. ''It's because I don't want the responsibility any longer for this movable feast,'' she said, explaining that she was tired of carting the art from Switzerland to California and New York when she changed residences. Coincidentally, more than 20 items in her extensive jewelry collection are being sold today as part of an auction at Sotheby's in New York.         Tributes for Giving and Acting         The actress was known for her philanthropies as well as her art and gems. In the last 12 years, she awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to 300 theater and film students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She had previously given the university the diaries, manuscripts and personal library of Remarque, who died in 1970. In a statement yesterday, John Brademas, the university's president, hailed the ''vision and continued generosity'' of ''this remarkable actress.''         Miss Goddard's acting also inspired tributes. The writer Robert Benchley praised her as ''a woman who could charm a rock,'' and Ray Milland, a frequent co-star, hailed her as ''the most honest actress I ever knew; she gave it all she had.''         A celebrated Goddard role was a witty social-climber in ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' directed in 1946 by Jean Renoir. She said she preferred such roles to ''sweet, boring'' parts and that moviegoers also favored ''adventuruous characters because 90 percent of the public is good.'' When an interviewer called her glamorous, she defined glamour as ''a spell of charm,'' adding: ''I don't want to be a phony. I want to be real.''         The actress could also be blunt. When several of her friends were accused of being Communists by members of Congress in 1947, she remarked, ''If anyone accuses me of being a Communist, I'll hit them with my diamond bracelets.''         Powers Model and Ziegfeld Girl         Paulette Goddard was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I., on June 3, 1911, according to major film refererence works. However, news agencies yesterday quoted municipal employees in Ronco as giving her birth year of record as 1905. Her parents separated in her childhood, and she later chose her mother's maiden name, Goddard.         She left school early and became a Powers model and then a Ziegfeld Girl. She was briefly married to Edgar W. James, a lumber industrialist, and soon sought fame in Hollywood. She played a series of chorus and other bit parts, joined the Hal Roach stock company and met Mr. Chaplin, from whom she became inseparable.         Miss Goddard's later film roles included ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940), ''Nothing But the Truth'' (1941), ''So Proudly We Hail'' (1943), ''Kitty'' (1946), ''Unconquered'' (1947) and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1949).         Her roles in the 1950's were disappointing, and, except for a 1964 Italian film, ''Time of Indifference,'' she lived in retirement with Mr. Remarque from the time of her marriage to the novelist in 1958 until his death. Her other marriges ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lady Keith, known to her friends as Slim, had just completed her memoirs, ''Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life,'' which is to be published later this year by Simon & Schuster.         Known for her wit and charm, she was a sought-after guest, a close friend of Ernest Hemingway, the Selznicks and much of Hollywood and New York society. Truman Capote, who called her ''Big Mama,'' was one of her closest friends until he wrote ''Answered Prayers,'' an article that caricatured New York society. After the article was published in Esquire she never spoke to Mr. Capote again.         In her later years her circle of friends included Mike Nichols and Jerome Robbins.         Married Hawks and Hayward         A native of Salinas, Calif., she acquired her title from her third husband, Lord Kenneth Keith, a British merchant banker, whom she married in 1962.         She was Mary Raye Gross at her birth on July 15, 1916, but her mother changed her name to Nancy. She grew up to be the kind of beauty that was sought after in Hollywood, although she never appeared in films. In her early 20's she became a regular guest at San Simeon, the Hearst estate, and in 1941 Gary Cooper gave her away when she married Howard Hawks, the director and producer. Their daughter, Kitty Hawks, survives her.         In 1946, 150 fashion editors and stylists named ''Slim'' Hawks the best-dressed woman of the year. The runner-up was the Duchess of Windsor. At the time, Mrs. Hawks was quoted as saying, ''I have a tall, skinny frame that clothes look well on. Seriously, just say that I'm a great believer in simplicity in clothes.''         In her Hollywood years she was credited with discovering and promoting such stars as Lauren Bacall, Joanne Dru and Ella Raines, all of whom resembled her somewhat in their casual, long-limbed type of good looks.         Two days after she and Mr. Hawks were divorced in 1949, she married Leland Hayward, the movie and theatrical producer, at the Manhasset, L.I., estate of William S. Paley. She and Mr. Hayward divorced in 1959 and three years later she married Kenneth Keith. They were divorced in 1972. ''I was married to each for about 10 years,'' she said at the time. ''I guess that's about all I can hack.''         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Theodora Andersen, of Burlingame, Calif., and four stepchildren, Alastaire Keith and Camilla Mackesson, the children of Lord Keith, and William Hayward and Brooke Hayward Duchin.       
        Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Since Mrs. Hyde was found to have cancer five years ago, she worked ardently to call attention to the disease, raising nearly $2 million for Georgetown University Medical Center, which established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research last year.         In March she organized a benefit at the new Chanel boutique at the Willard Hotel in Washington for which 350 people paid $350 a ticket. The evening raised more than $50,000 for the Nina Hyde Center and an equal amount for Look Good . . . Feel Better, a separate counseling program that helps women after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.         As a reporter, Mrs. Hyde was known for covering fashion as intently as if she were covering a war, searching for the sociological significance of such trends as the development of the punk style in London.         Style of Protest Movement         Her article on that phenomenon helped draw attention at the end of the 1970's to the protest movement among the young. It also helped alert retailers to the London street scene.         She traveled through Europe and the Far East for exhaustive studies of the history of silk and of wool, with her analysis appearing in National Geographic. She was also noted for her ''Ins and Outs'' column on New Year's Day, which covered political and social trends as well as fashion.         She also conducted a lecture series at the Smithsonian Institution, with guests like the designers Issey Miyake, Norma Kamali and Sonia Rykiel.         But she was not averse to offering mundane, sensible advice to women on how to dress. Short skirts look younger than long ones, she believed. Classic shapes are good investments, she said. She advised her readers to buy clothes on sale and at discount. She herself usually wore black dresses and very little makeup.         The daughter of Dr. Harry A. Solomon, an internist, and his wife, Ruth, she was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College. One of two women accepted at the time for New York University's Law School, she dropped out to work for McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, and the Maidenform Brassiere Company. Later she joined Women's Wear Daily as the corset and brassiere editor. In 1961, after marrying Lloyd Hyde, a real estate developer, she moved to Washington where she wrote a column, ''Hyde & Chic,'' for The Washington Daily News. After that newspaper's demise she joined The Washington Post, in 1972.         Celebrities Honor Writer         In 1986, when the Fashion Group decided to honor her at a formal dinner raising money for the group's' scholarship fund, she insisted that some proceeds go toward AIDS research. More than 800 people paid $150 to attend, including fashion designers like Bill Blass, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren from New York, Carla Fendi and Rosita Missoni from Italy and Jacqueline de Ribes and Thierry Mugler from Paris.         Fashion designers have been major contributors to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Mr. Lauren was host at a cocktail party two years ago and donated $100,000 to get the fund started. Other supporters include Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix and Yves Saint Laurent and the Chanel company.         Mrs. Hyde received the Eugenia Sheppard Award for outstanding fashion reporting by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1988 and she was made a Chevalier des Artes et Lettres in Paris last October.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Washington, and Andrea, of San Francisco; her mother, Ruth Solomon of New York; a brother, Howard Solomon of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Marquise Sue de Brantes, of St. Armand Lepypre, France.         The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. Monday at the Washington Hebrew Congregation at Macomb Street and Massachusetts Avenue.       
        Dovima, the model whom Richard Avedon called ''the most remarkable and unconventional beauty of her time,'' died of cancer on Thursday at her home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 63 years old.         Dovima, the model whom Richard Avedon called ''the most remarkable and unconventional beauty of her time,'' died of cancer on Thursday at her home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 63 years old.         Born Dorothy Virginia Margaret Juba in Jackson Heights, Queens, she constructed the name by which she was known from the initials of her given names. It was the name of an imaginary companion she invented as a child when she was bedridden with rheumatic fever.         Along with Lisa Fonssagrives, Sonny Harnett, Dorean Leigh, Suzy Parker and Jean Patchett, Dovima personified the haughty, regal look of the 1950's. She left modeling in 1962, at the age of 35, saying, ''I didn't want to wait until the camera turned cruel.'' She had several small roles in television plays before retiring in 1975.         ''She was the last of the great elegant, aristocratic beauties,'' said Mr. Avedon, who photographed them all. His picture of Dovima with elephants that appeared in Harper's Bazaar in 1955 is one of the most widely anthologized of all fashion photographs.         Like Mona Lisa         ''I never thought of myself as a beautiful woman,'' she told an interviewer four years ago. ''As a child, I was a gangly, skinny thing and I had this ugly front tooth that I broke when I was playing dress-up in my mother's clothes.''         She was walking out of an Automat in 1949 with her first husband, Jack Golden, when a woman asked her if she had ever been a fashion model. The woman said she worked for Vogue magazine and invited her to have some test photographs made. The next day she was photographed by Irving Penn. She kept her mouth closed because of her bad tooth and the photo had a mysterious look that reminded those who saw it of the Mona Lisa. Within a year she was one of the most popular models at the Ford Model Agency, where she made $30 an hour when the other leading models made $25.         ''I think she went up to $60,'' recalled Jerry Ford, who runs the agency with his wife, Eileen. ''She was the super-sophisticated model in a sophisticated time, definitely not the girl next door. After her came the young junior look from London with Jean Shrimpton, Twiggy and Penelope Tree, and fashion was off on another tack.''         She was married three times and had a daughter, Allison, with her second husband, Alan Murray. Her last husband, West Hollingsworth, a bartender, died in 1985.         In 1974 she moved to Fort Lauderdale to be near her parents, who had retired there. Her father, Stanley, had been a police officer in Manhattan. She worked at odd jobs, like selling cosmetics and serving as a hostess at the Two Guys Pizzeria in Fort Lauderdale.         ''They're nice people,'' she said of her employers there. ''They treat me well. I'm the mascot on their softball team.''         She is survived by her mother, Peggy Juba, and a brother, Stanley Juba, both of Fort Lauderdale.       
        Kezia Keeble, a former Vogue editor and a powerful public-relations executive who helped reshape the image of American fashion, died at her home in Manhattan on Friday night.         Kezia Keeble, a former Vogue editor and a powerful public-relations executive who helped reshape the image of American fashion, died at her home in Manhattan on Friday night.         She died of breast cancer after a five-year battle with the disease, her business partner, Paul Cavaco, said. She was 48 years old.         She was a founder and the president of Keeble Cavaco & Duka, a public relations and advertising company. The agency was recognized for its award-winning campaigns for Bergdorf Goodman, the specialty store, and in recent years the company helped bring several American fashion designers to prominence, including Stephen Sprouse, Bill Robinson, Charlotte Neuville and Gordon Henderson.         The agency now represents such designers as Gianni Versace, Ronaldus Shanask, Robert Lee Morris and Gordon Henderson. The agency will continue to operate under the direction of its remaining partners.         Youngest Vogue Editor         Ms. Keeble attended the Spence School and the Westover School and Briarcliff College. She began her career at Conde Nast publications in 1963 as a dress, suit and coat editor at Glamour magazine. When she went to work at Vogue under editor Diana Vreeland in 1966 at the age of 24, she was one of the youngest editors ever at the magazine.         She was later fashion editor at Esquire from 1976 to 1977.         In the early 1970's, after starting a successful jewelry company, she began work as a freelance fashion-photography stylist, helping to create the look and mood of photographs and television commercials. In 1976 she married Mr. Cavaco and formed a partnership, Keeble Cavaco Inc.         Ms. Keeble's early association with photographers like Bruce Weber and Steven Meisel resulted in innovative advertising campaigns for such clients as Christian Dior, Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein. Mr. Klein's controversial jeans commercials with Brooke Shields were among the campaigns.         After her divorce from Mr. Cavaco, in 1985, she married John Duka, a style reporter for The New York Times, and formed the present company, Keeble Cavaco & Duka. Mr. Duka died in 1989.         Fast-talking and irrepressibly enthusiastic, Ms. Keeble had reached the level in her business where she had become that rare public-relations executive who did not return journalists' phone calls.         Ms. Keeble is survived by her daughter, Cayli Cavaco of Manhattan; her mother, Barbara Mott of Bronxville, N.Y., and her sister, Lucy Keeble Wilkinson of Atlanta.         A memorial service is to be announced this week.

        Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         ''She first came to see me at the beach about 15 years ago when my kids were little,'' Ralph Lauren recalled. ''She was a very sparkly girl, and her pictures were great. The ones she did of my family are hanging in my office today.''         When she was starting as a photographer, after studying at Pratt Institute, Mrs. Walz heard Jill Krementz in a lecture at New York University tell how she had decided to concentrate on photographing authors.         ''She then decided to specialize in fashion,'' Miss Krementz said. ''I guess I was her mentor. She turned out to be not only a superb technician, but a woman of wit and wisdom, a photographer with a warm generous heart.''         The Entertaining Insight         In the introduction to her first book, ''The Fashion Makers,'' published in 1978, when designers were achieving the star status of athletes and entertainers, Mrs. Walz described her approach. ''I always tried to bring out some part of their personality for the public to see,'' she wrote. ''I found a magic in the designers I photographed. I also became aware that the public was reaching to them on a new level and they had become celebrities.''         She photographed her subjects in bathtubs, gymnasiums, dental offices and beauty parlors to capture the entertaining insight into their personalities. For a study of Elsa Peretti, Mrs. Waltz went to Spain and photographed the designer in her pool. Despite having lost a leg to cancer when she was 15, Mrs. Walz climbed a 12-foot ladder to find the right angle.         Not all of her subjects were in the fashion field. ''Starring Mothers,'' about well-known mothers and their children, was published in 1987, after her own two daughters had been born. Mrs. Walz's subjects included Diane Feinstein, Patti Labelle, Sally Quinn and Carly Simon. It was considered one of the best photographic books of the year and was included in a group show by the International Center of Photography.         Her subjects for 15 cover stories for The New York Times Magazine included E. L. Doctorow, Joseph Papp and Stephen Sondheim. Her photographs also appeared in GQ, Metropolitan Home, Parade, Rolling Stone and Town & Country.         Surviving are her husband, a furniture and interior designer, their children, Jersey, and Addison, and her parents, Stanley and Pauline Turner, of Toms River, N.J.

Palmira Henry, a fashion model known as Pal, died of a cerebral hemmorrhage on Sunday at New York Hospital, her daughter, Lisa, said. She was 44 years old and had modeled for more than 20 years.         Ms. Henry was associated with the house of Adolfo for much of her career. The designer fitted all his clothes on her and used her photographs in his advertisements. She also waited on customers in his salon. Before joining Adolfo, Ms. Henry was a freelance model.         Surviving are her daughter; two sisters, Maria Hackshaw of Pleasantville, N.Y., and Betty Diaz-Cane of Hawaii, and a brother, Fermin Diaz of Jersey City.       
        Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and died on Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of death.  She was born Madge McHarg on in Melbourne, Australia. She grew up in London and became a journalist in the 1920's, first working for English Vogue with the novelist Aldous Huxley and the photographer Cecil Beaton, and later freelancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.         She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor in 1933.         During World War II, she became merchandising manager for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store here, and designed some fashion.         In 1948, she founded the first British school of fashion, at the invitation of the Royal College of Art. She remained at its head until 1956.         She produced five books on fashion and the history of costumes.         She was married in the 1920's to Capt. Ewart Garland. In 1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; they were divorced in 1962. She had no children.       
        Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Mrs. Behrman, who was known as Madame Alexander, began designing dolls for her father, a Russian emigre, during World War I, when she began making ''Red Cross Nurse'' rag dolls. In 1923 she founded the Alexander Doll Company, in which she produced rag dolls with innovative three-dimensional facial features that she hand-painted. In the 1930's she began making dolls with lifelike details like eyes with lashes that closed and fingers with knuckles.         With the advent of plastic after World War II, she made dolls with vinyl heads and elaborate hair that could be styled. She also created designer clothing for the dolls and received international attention. In 1953, a collection of her dolls featuring, in authentic detail, Queen Elizabeth I and 35 principals at her coronation was presented to the Brooklyn Children's Museum.         In 1965, she was honored by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Arthur Goldberg, for her collection of international dolls that featured the native dress of every country represented at the U.N.         She also created dolls that portrayed characters in books and movies like Alice in Wonderland, Orphan Annie, Nancy Drew, the four sisters in ''Little Women'' and characters from Charles Dickens's books. Her ''Madame'' doll, based on the American Revolution, and her ''Scarlett O'Hara'' doll, portraying the Civil War era in ''Gone with the Wind,'' were included in the Smithsonian Institution in 1968.         She also designed children's clothing and won four Fashion Academy gold medals. Her company, which was sold two years ago to two New York businessmen, has created more than 5,000 different dolls at its factory in on West 131st Street in Harlem, where it has about 600 employees and is one of the area's largest employers. Many of the dolls have become collectors' items and sell for about $5,000.         She is survived by a daughter, Mildren Birnbaum of Purchase, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.; a grandson, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Lisa Kirk, a cabaret performer who won Broadway acclaim in the late 1940's singing "The Gentleman Is a Dope" in the musical "Allegro" and "Always True to You (In My Fashion)" in "Kiss Me, Kate," died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 62 years old and had homes in New York City and Malibu, Calif.         Miss Kirk died of lung cancer, said her husband, the lyricist and producer Robert Wells. He said she had known of her illness for only two weeks, after seeing doctors because of a slight cough and mild fatigue. "She had never been ill in her life," he said. "She didn't drink, and she didn't smoke. It's unbelievable."         In the late 1960's, Miss Kirk was injured in an autombile accident that threatened to end her career. But she started "training like a fighter," she recalled later. When she appeared in 1972 at the St. Regis Sheraton Hotel in New York City, John S. Wilson of The New York Times wrote that "she is dancing and singing as though nothing had ever happened." Inspired by Cole Porter         Miss Kirk said at the time: "I kept thinking of Cole Porter, who had both legs crushed in a riding accident 10 years before he wrote 'Kiss Me, Kate.' It was seeing his determination to get better that made me work so hard."         When Miss Kirk performed at Rainbow and Stars last year, Mr. Wilson praised her "warm, easy projection" and said, "Her long career has given her polish, presence and a solid foundation of songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter and Jerry Herman with which she is associated."         Brought up in Roscoe, Pa., Miss Kirk studied at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. She appeared in New York nightclubs and on Broadway in "Good Night Ladies." But it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Allegro" that brought her fame in 1947. Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" the following year cemented her reputation.         Brooks Atkinson of The Times wrote, "Having startled the town last season by singing 'The Gentleman Is a Dope' as though she meant it, Miss Kirk is captivating it this year as a fully accredited hoyden with a sense of humor."         "Given a sardonic song like 'Always True to You (In My Fashion),' " he wrote, "she can translate it into pert and gleaming buffoonery."         Miss Kirk told an interviewer in 1956 that she had not realized at first that she had comic gifts. "I had the vague idea of becoming a new Helen Morgan," she recalled. "With that in mind, I practiced a song before a mirror and framed it in what I considered appropriate gestures. When I did it for a director and some backers of a show, those men fell off their seats laughing. I could see that the laugh wasn't ridicule. They were amused."         In 1964 she returned to Broadway, stepping into Meredith Willson's musical "Here's Love." In 1974 she appeared in "Mack and Mabel," a Broadway show with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. She was in a 1984 revival of Noel Coward's "Design for Living" at the Circle in the Square theater and appeared in London last summer in Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant."         She is survived by her husband.         A funeral service is planned for Friday at 11:15 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Madison Avenue and 81st Street.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Carol E. Rinzler, a lawyer and author, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old. She had suffered a neck injury recently, but the cause of her death was not immediately determined, her family said.         Ms. Rinzler pursued a dual career as a specialist in publishing law and as a writer who dealt in lighthearted fashion with childhood and adolescence. She was the author of "Nobody Said You Had to Eat Off the Floor," published in 1971; "The Girl Who Got All the Breaks" (1980), and "Your Adolescent: An Owner's Manual" (1981).         In the "owner's manual," addressed to people who find living with an adolescent more painful than adolescence itself, Ms. Rinzler offered advice like: "An adolescent who is cheerful at breakfast should be kept home from school that day."         Ms. Rinzler was born in Newark and was a graduate of Goucher College. She received her law degree from Yale and was with the Manhattan law firms of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Rembar & Curtis before establishing her own practice earlier this year.         She was a contributing editor of Publishers Weekly, a book critic and columnist for Mademoiselle and Cosmopolitan magazines, and a writer of reviews and articles for The New York Times Book Review and other publications.         Ms. Rinzler is survived by her father, Irving Eisen, of Mount Pleasant, S.C.; a son, Michael, and a daughter, Jane, both of Manhattan.
