         Dr. Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist and self-help author whose books touched on identity, resolving stress and the grief occasioned by the World Trade Center attacks, died on Jan. 10 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. She was 55.         The cause was respiratory failure after pneumonia, said her husband, Steven Fink.         One of her books, ''The Type E Woman,'' published in 1986, described the stresses of balancing a career and family. Dr. Braiker's literary agent, Alice Martel, said the ''E'' represented the woman who tried to be ''everything to everybody.'' The book was a response to research into the Type A personality so often associated with hard-driving men. It was Dr. Braiker's favorite through the years, Mr. Fink said.         In another book, ''The Disease to Please,'' she described a destructive propensity that drives people, usually women, to serve others to the detriment of their own well-being.         In the introduction to ''The September 11 Syndrome,'' published four months after the 2001 attacks, she described the premise of the book as helping readers turn ''our collective emotional adversity'' into their own psychological victories. The book prescribed steps to control feelings of helplessness and anxiety awakened by terrorism.         Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who met Dr. Braiker in graduate school, said she ''brought an extremely strong theoretical background to popular writing.''         ''Her books took problems that were common and subliminal and put them out in the open,'' Dr. Jamison said.         Harriet Beryl Braiker was born in Los Angeles. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and won a National Science Foundation research scholarship. In 1975, she received a doctorate in clinical and social psychology from U.C.L.A.         Before establishing a private practice in 1980, Dr. Braiker worked at the RAND Corporation, analyzing health policies for the federal government. She later became a contributing editor for Working Woman and a columnist for Lear's magazine. She also appeared on television and radio talk shows and was an expert witness in legal cases on sexual harassment.         Although her earliest works examined alcoholism, depression and destructive relationships, her most recent book, ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?'' (2003), was a study of manipulation.         In addition to her husband, surviving are their daughter, Amanda Fink, also of Pasadena; a stepson, Stuart, of New York; and a brother, Dr. Barry Braiker of Beverly Hills, Calif.       
         Charlotte Zwerin, a documentary filmmaker known for insightful depictions of visual and performing artists like Christo, Willem de Kooning, Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Lisa Tesone said.         Ms. Zwerin worked for many years with David and Albert Maysles, early practitioners of the documentary genre known as cinéma vérité, which uses a small camera to capture the drama of daily experience. Her editing for them was of such quality that they gave her credit as the third director of well-known films like ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), an account of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour of the United States.         It was her decision to include the band members' reactions to the killing of a fan on the stage of a concert at the Altamont Speedway in Livermore, Calif., the site of the tour's last concert.         ''The real hero of the making of the film was Charlotte Zwerin, who edited it and got a directing credit,'' Stephen Lighthill, a cameraman, said in an interview with Salon.com. ''I was stunned with what she got out of my footage. She compressed it and gave you a sense of a buildup of tragedy that you otherwise wouldn't have.''         Other films she did with the Maysleses included ''Salesman'' (1969), an account of four real-life sales representatives of the American Bible Company, and ''Running Fence'' (1978), a chronicle of the successful efforts of the artist Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, to erect a 24-mile fabric fence in the California hills.         Her own films included ''Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser'' (1989), which contained rarely seen clips of the brilliant and eccentric jazz pianist; ''Arshile Gorky'' (1982), a profile of the abstract painter; ''Sculpture of Spaces: Noguchi'' (1995); ''American Masters -- Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live For'' (1999), a biography narrated by Tony Bennett; and ''Toru Takemitsu: Music for the Movies'' (1994), an examination of the Japanese composer. The Museum of Modern Art had a retrospective of her works last year.         Charlotte Mitchell was born on Aug. 15, 1931, in Detroit and developed her affection for film and music as a child by attending an entertainment event in Detroit called ''Big Band and a Movie.'' First came a live band, then the film, she said in an interview with The New York Times last year.         She attended Wayne State University, where she established a film society before moving to New York and finding work as a librarian at CBS for its documentary series ''The 20th Century.'' She slowly worked her way up to editor, then joined Drew Associates, where Robert Drew was pioneering ''direct cinema,'' as cinéma vérité was also called. She met the Maysleses at Drew.         She told The Times she stopped working with the Maysleses because they would not let her produce. ''They cast an awful long shadow, and it came time for me to get out of it,'' she said.         On her own films she became known for a personal signature characterized by innovative editing. Leonard Feather, a critic for The Los Angeles Times, said that her film on Monk provided ''a closer glance behind the veil of this half-hidden, exotically gifted figure than could ever be observed during his sadly aborted career.''         Ms. Zwerin was divorced from Michael Zwerin, a jazz critic. She is survived by her brother, Charles Mitchell, and sister, Margaret Tesone, both of Detroit.         Correction:  January 31, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the documentary film maker Charlotte Zwerin on Tuesday misstated the location of the fatal stabbing of a fan at a 1969 Rolling Stones concert shown in ''Gimme Shelter,'' a film she edited. It occurred in front of the stage, not onstage.       
         Linda Stone Davidoff, a civic activist and champion of progressive social causes who ran Elizabeth Holtzman's unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate in New York in 1980, died on Wednesday in Tucson, Ariz. She was 62.         The cause was pneumonia related to acute myelogenous leukemia, said her son, Daniel Kirk-Davidoff. Ms. Stone Davidoff, who lived in New York City, had gone to Tucson on a brief vacation, he said.         Ms. Stone Davidoff was executive director of several nonprofit organizations, including, most recently, the Citizens Union, a government watchdog group based in New York. She also headed the Citizens Union Foundation, a related institution.         She was also active in Democratic politics. In addition to Ms. Holtzman's campaign, she was for a time a manager of Ruth W. Messinger's unsuccessful campaign for mayor of New York City in 1997.         Ms. Stone Davidoff's first marriage, to the urban planner Paul Davidoff, ended with his death in 1984. In 1997 she married Harold Stone.         Besides Mr. Stone, she is survived by her children: Mr. Kirk-Davidoff of Takoma Park, Md., Susan Davidoff of Newton, Mass., Carla Davidoff of New Paltz, N.Y., and Thomas Davidoff of Oakland, Calif.; her stepchildren Christopher Stone of Brooklyn, Nicholas Stone of Falls Church, Va., and Rebecca Stone of Brookline, Mass.; her sisters Jean Stange of Denver and Adria Lique of Hopewell, N.J.; a brother, Richard Greenberg of Springfield, Mass.; and 12 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.       
         Fraydele Oysher, a star of the Yiddish theater and a member of a musical dynasty, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan, said her daughter, the singer and comedian Marilyn Michaels. She was 90.         The daughter of a cantor, Ms. Oysher began her career as a child actress in the Yiddish theaters that once dotted Second Avenue on the Lower East Side. She starred in musicals written for her, including ''The Little Queen,'' ''The Golden Girl'' and ''Fraydele's Wedding.''         She also specialized in one of the Yiddish theater's staple roles: the Yeshiva boy who -- it is revealed in the final, showstopping number -- is really a girl.         ''I was cute, I was flat and I was a terrific piece of work,'' she explained in a 1996 interview with The Daily News.         As an adult, she became one of the first women to sing cantorial music onstage, long before women were allowed to assume that role in Reform and Conservative synagogues. She also toured the United States, South America and Cuba, performing folk songs, theater songs and liturgical chants with her husband, Harold Sternberg.         Mr. Sternberg, who appeared on Broadway in a number of George Gershwin's shows, was also a basso profundo in the Metropolitan Opera chorus for 40 years.         Ms. Oysher's brother, Moishe, was a major star in Yiddish theater and films and a cantor known as ''the master singer of his people.''         Fraydele Oysher was born on Oct. 3, 1913, in Lipkon, Bessarabia, which was then a Russian province. (It is now part of Moldova.)         In addition to Ms. Michaels, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Oysher is survived by her son, Michael Sternberg, also of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Mary A. Gardner, a journalism professor whose teaching had a strong influence on contemporary journalism in Mexico and Latin America, died Jan. 22 in East Lansing, Mich., her sister-in-law, Donna Gardner, said. She was 83.         Dr. Gardner's influence in Mexico stemmed from her connection to a former student, Alejandro Junco de la Vega. Mr. Junco, heir to what was then a small family-owned newspaper company that published El Norte in Monterrey, studied journalism with Dr. Gardner at the University of Texas.         When he took over the family business, he turned to his former teacher to help train his staff in reporting, writing and ethics. For more than 20 years, Dr. Gardner spent her summers training reporters at El Norte.         In the mid-1990's, Mr. Junco started a newspaper in Mexico City, Reforma, incorporating the journalistic principles Dr. Gardner helped to instill at El Norte.         Today, Reforma is regarded by many as Mexico's most influential publication.         ''She had an enormous influence on the quality of journalism in Mexico, and in Latin America as well,'' said Richard Cole, dean of the University of North Carolina journalism school and another former student of Dr. Gardner's.         Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Mary Gardner never intended to be a journalist or a teacher; rather, she aspired to be a physician. A pre-med student at Ohio State University, she was informed that medical school was not an option because she was a woman.         After serving in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II, she earned a master's degree in journalism from Ohio State. In 1960, she received a doctorate in journalism and political science from the University of Minnesota, where she began her teaching career.         In 1961 she moved to the University of Texas, where she was an assistant professor until 1966. She then taught at the Michigan State University School of Journalism until she retired in 1991.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her brother, Porter, of Zoar, Ohio.       
         Jan Miner, who had a long career on the New York stage but was best known as Madge the Manicurist in Palmolive commercials, died on Sunday in Bethel, Conn. She was 86 and lived in nearby Southbury.         She had been in failing health for several years and died at the Bethel Health Care Facility, said her New York agent, Michael Thomas.         From the 1940's to the 1980's, Ms. Miner was never far from productions on and off Broadway or on out-of-town stages, from New Haven and Stratford, Conn., to St. Louis. She was also on radio programs, including the popular ''Boston Blackie'' series as Richard Kollmar's leading lady in the late 1940's, and appeared in films and in television plays and series.         The Palmolive commercials featured Ms. Miner as Madge, who praised the gentleness of its dish detergent to a customer surprised to find that her hands were soaking in it. She played the character for 27 years. Meanwhile she appeared in repertory productions at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford for six seasons.         She frequently shared the stage with her husband of 35 years, Richard Merrell, an actor and writer, who died in 1988. Among her later appearances on Broadway were roles in revivals of ''The Women'' in 1973, Lillian Hellman's ''Watch on the Rhine'' in 1980 and ''Heartbreak House'' at the Circle in the Square Theater in 1983 and 1984.         Janice Miner was born on Oct. 15, 1917, in Boston, the daughter of a dentist and a painter. She studied at the Vesper George School of Art in Boston and trained for the stage with Lee Strasberg, among others. She made her stage debut in Boston in Elmer Rice's ''Street Scene'' in 1945 and in New York as Maria Louvin in ''Obligatoo'' in 1948.         She was seen with Rex Harrison in ''Heartbreak House'' and with Jane Alexander in ''The Heiress.'' Other roles were in ''Othello,'' ''Major Barbara'' and Franco Zeffirelli's productions of ''Saturday, Sunday, Monday'' and ''Lady of the Camellias.''         With her husband she appeared in ''The Gin Game'' at the Missouri Repertory Theater. Her film credits included ''Lenny,'' with Dustin Hoffman, and ''Mermaids,'' with Cher. Her many roles as a guest star on television included a recent appearance on ''Law and Order.''         Ms. Miner is survived by a brother, Donald Miner, of Concord, N.H.         She made the Palmolive commercials in French, German, Danish and Italian. The legendary actress Eva Le Gallienne coached her in French.         ''I'd dip my hands in Palmolive the rest of my life,'' Ms. Miner once said, because it left her free to pick and choose her theater roles.       
         Estelle Stewart Axton, whose name put the ''Ax'' in Stax Records, the Memphis soul label she founded with her brother, died on Tuesday in Memphis. She was 85.         She died at the St. Francis Nursing Home after a series of strokes, said Deanie Parker, the president and chief executive of Soulsville, the nonprofit corporation that runs the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.         In the heyday of 1960's and 70's soul, Stax released hits by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas and the Staple Singers, among many others. It was the second-best-selling soul label of its era, behind Motown Records.         The Stax studio, in the former Capitol movie theater in Memphis, attracted young singers and songwriters, and was an integrated business in a largely segregated city. Ms. Axton and her brother, James Stewart, founders of the label, were white; most of their hitmakers were black; and the label's studio band, Booker T. and the MG's, was mixed. ''We never looked at color; we looked at people,'' Ms. Axton said last year.         Stax got started as Satellite Records in 1957, when Mr. Stewart, a country fiddler who worked at a bank, began recording country songs in his wife's uncle's garage, but soon switched to rhythm-and-blues. His eldest sister, Estelle Stewart, who had married Everett Axton in 1941, became Mr. Stewart's partner in 1958 when she took out a second mortgage on her home to buy recording equipment. In 1960 they leased the abandoned theater, in a mixed neighborhood that was fast becoming an African-American ghetto, and made it the company's offices and recording studio.         To generate income they installed a record store at the theater's old candy counter. The shop, Satellite Records, drew teenagers and became a place to recruit talent and a test market for their new releases. The first singers to record at the studio were Rufus Thomas and Carla Thomas, father and daughter, and their rhythm-and-blues song ''Cause I Love You'' became the label's first regional hit, followed by Carla Thomas's ''Gee Whiz.''         The label's third hit, ''Last Night,'' was an instrumental by the Mar-Keys, a group including Ms. Axton's son, Charles (nicknamed Packy) Axton, on saxophone. After ''Last Night'' was released, a Satellite Records label in California noticed the company. Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton changed their label's name to Stax, from the first letters of Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton's last names.         The label began regularly releasing hits through the 1960's. Musicians called Ms. Axton Lady A., and in Rob Bowman's ''Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records'' (Schirmer Trade Books, 1997), the guitarist and songwriter Steve Cropper describes her as ''the heart and soul of that whole place.''         She nurtured songwriters, ran the record store and helped decide what Stax released, including, over her brother's initial opposition, Eddie Floyd's ''Knock on Wood.''         Although Stax was a musical powerhouse, it was a business debacle. After bad deals with major labels, the company went bankrupt in 1975. By then Ms. Axton was no longer with the company. In 1969, after disagreement about the label's direction, she quietly left the company in 1969, bought out by her brother and the label's president, Al Bell.         Part of her settlement included $25,000 a year on the condition that she stay out of the recording business. Her son Charles became the head of Fretone Records, and in 1974 Ms. Axton took over. That label's big hit, in 1976, was the Rick Dees novelty song ''Disco Duck.''         Ms. Axton is survived by her sister, Mary Lucille McAlpin; her brother, Mr. Stewart; her daughter, Doris Axton Fredrick; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Stax's headquarters was demolished in 1989, but last year a new building on the site, complete with a reproduction of the studio and a new Satellite Record Shop, opened as the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.       
         Barbara Gamarekian, a former reporter on the arts and Washington society for The New York Times who was previously a press aide in the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses, died yesterday in Washington. She was 78.         The cause was peritoneal cancer, said a niece, Rachel Hughes.         Ms. Gamarekian arrived in Washington in 1957 to work on the legislative staff of Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.         She joined the presidential campaign staff of John F. Kennedy and was one of nine assistants to President Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre E. Salinger. She was in charge of photo and television coverage.         ''Ours was not the posh West Wing of television fame,'' she wrote in an article in The Times in 2001 that reflected the kind of observation she brought to her many articles about architecture.         ''The room sported harsh overhead lighting, government-issue furniture and limp, gray-green tie-backs on the windows.''         In 2001, she wrote an article for The Times on her experience in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, telling of her surreal night in a bomb shelter under the East Wing that she had never known existed.         Last year, some of her other memories of the Kennedy White House were in the news when an interview she gave in 1964 for the John F. Kennedy Library came to light.         In it, she spoke of President Kennedy's romantic liaison with a college-age intern who could not type. Ms. Gamarekian told some details to the historian Robert Dallek when he was researching his book, ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963.'' The transcript, which Ms. Gamarekian had originally wanted sealed indefinitely, then became public.         ''Certainly it is something that I never discussed because if you are working for the administration, you feel a loyalty to it,'' she said of the affair in the library interview. ''It is the sort of thing you don't discuss, something you profess complete ignorance of when you attend the inevitable cocktail parties where this is the subject for discussion.''         Barbara Soellner was born Aug. 31, 1925, in Schenectady, N.Y.         In 1966, she was hired as an administrative assistant to the chief of the Washington bureau of The Times and eventually became a reporter specializing in cultural news in Washington.         Her subjects ranged beyond the Kennedy Center and National Endowment for the Arts to include a cookbook by Ralph Nader's mother and how men and women communicate. She became particularly known for her articles on what she called the movers and shakers of Washington. She retired from The Times in 1991.         Ms. Gamarekian, who was divorced, is survived by her brother, Glenn Soellner of Burnt Hill, N.Y., and her sister, Robin Hughes of Schenectady.         Her last article, which appeared in The Times in October, brought a light touch to her musings about losing her hair as a result of chemotherapy.         She said her penciled eyebrows gave her the look of an ''aging 1920's flapper.''       
         Trude Wenzel Lash, inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become a children's advocate through the Citizens Commission for Children of New York, died on Wednesday at her home in Greenwich Village, her family said. She was 95.         Mrs. Lash was an early mainstay of the commission, which Mrs. Roosevelt helped found in 1944. Mrs. Lash, a refugee from Germany who befriended Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt, became the commission's program director in 1946 and was its executive director from 1952 to 1972.         After that, Mrs. Lash devoted herself to the Roosevelt legacy through the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y. Until 2000, she was the institute's co-chairwoman with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and at her death both were honorary chairmen of the institute, housed at the Franklin Roosevelt Library.         Trude Lash was born Gertrud Wenzel in June 1908 in Freiburg, Germany. A rebellious girl and brilliant student, she was thrown out of convent school, went on to study journalism in Berlin and, while teaching kindergarten and first grade, attended the University of Heidelberg.         At the University of Freiburg, she received a doctorate in philosophy in 1930. She came to New York for a year as an exchange teacher of philosophy and German literature at Hunter College while doing graduate work in the social sciences at Columbia.         Back in Germany, she wrote for a newspaper opposed to the Nazis. But in 1932 she returned to New York for good as the wife of Eliot D. Pratt, a member of a socially prominent family, and the couple helped other refugees from Europe find their way to the United States. They were divorced in 1943, and he died in 1969.         In 1944, she married Joseph P. Lash, a journalist and confidant of Eleanor Roosevelt, who played matchmaker to the couple. Mr. Lash wrote the two-volume biography ''Eleanor and Franklin,'' published in 1972.         Mrs. Lash, who worked for the Human Rights Commission at the United Nations before joining the staff of the Citizens Commission for Children, collected data on the status of children in New York for major studies in 1976 and 1980. She was principal investigator for the studies' reports, called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' The reports were influential in inspiring similar studies elsewhere.         After retiring, she continued her advocacy through the Foundation for Child Development and became directly involved in the Roosevelt memorials. After Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962, Congress had authorized an Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. Mrs. Lash helped establish the combined Franklin and Eleanor Institute in 1984 and until just before her death remained a consultant on Roosevelt memorabilia.         Trude Wenzel Lash is survived by three sons, Dr. Peter W. Pratt of Bridgewater, Conn., Roger S. Pratt of New Milford, Conn., and Jonathan Lash of Washington; a daughter, Vera C. Pratt, also of Washington; a brother, Heinz Wenzel of Germany; 11 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. Joseph Lash died in 1987.         Her commission work, which ranged from studying day care and foster care to juvenile detention, often involved sending volunteers to institutions to see how children were treated. It sometimes led to confrontations with officialdom.         ''All too often we take our most difficult children and we turn over their care to professionals, and we leave the matter,'' Trude Lash said in an interiew with The New York Times in 1972. ''But professionals, even good ones, are primarily interested in their jobs and their routines. What is needed is someone who is primarily interested in the children.''         Correction:  February 7, 2004, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Trude Wenzel Lash, an advocate for children in New York City, misstated the name of the organization for which she worked until 1972. It is the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, not Citizens Commission. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the name of the organization for which she later worked on reports called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' It is the Foundation for Child Development, not the committee.       
         May O'Donnell, an early Martha Graham principal dancer and a modern-dance choreographer and teacher, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 97.         Her death was reported by Marian Horosko, who is writing a book about her.         The serene Ms. O'Donnell might have served as the model for the tranquil all-seeing Pioneer Woman in Graham's 1944 ''Appalachian Spring,'' a role she created. Yet she had a robust sense of humor about the world of dance, and she was the rare dancer who stood up to the strong-willed Graham with quiet determination.         Ms. O'Donnell choreographed a modern-dance classic, the 1943 ''Suspension,'' which was inspired by her memory of seeing a plane below the hilltop on which she was standing in wartime California. That work was best explained, she felt, by T. S. Eliot's observation in ''Four Quartets'' that dance was ''at the still point of the turning world.''         In the piece dancers moved slowly amid boxes and a large turning mobile, seeming at times to float. ''Suspension'' confounded audiences accustomed to the highly charged narrative dances then popular. ''O'Donnell created a poetical cloud of movement that refused to be hurried,'' Donald McDonagh wrote in his Complete Guide to Modern Dance. ''The work didn't thunder, shout or roar its message; it whispered but eventually achieved recognition.''         Ms. O'Donnell was born in Sacramento and would later recall the heady openness and freedom of California, which had also affected the young Graham. In California, Ms. O'Donnell trained with Estelle Reed and Michio Ito before studying in New York with Graham. She performed with Graham from 1932 to 1938, then returned to California and founded the San Francisco Dance Theater with her husband, the composer Ray Green, and a Graham colleague and lifelong friend, Gertrude Shurr.         Ms. O'Donnell toured with José Limón from 1940 to 1942. She returned to Graham's company in 1944, dancing as a guest artist for nine years. During that time she created the major roles of the Attendant in Graham's ''Herodiade'' (1944), She of the Earth in ''Dark Meadow'' (1946) and the Chorus in ''Cave of the Heart'' (1946). She also danced principal roles in ''Letter to the World,'' ''Deaths and Entrances,'' ''Every Soul Is a Circus'' and ''Primitive Mysteries.'' She retired from the stage in 1961.         Ms. O'Donnell choreographed from 1937 to 1988, presenting her first program of her own work in 1939. In 1949 she founded a New York-based company that performed into the 1980's. In 2002 she received the Martha Hill Lifetime Achievement Award.         Her repertory of 50 documented dances included many collaborations with Mr. Green, who died in 1997. Ms. O'Donnell is survived by a brother, Charles Melton O'Donnell of Sacramento.         Ms. O'Donnell was also an influential teacher. Her students included Gerald Arpino, Cora Cahan, Robert Joffrey, Ben Vereen and Dudley Williams. Mr. Vereen recalled Ms. O'Donnell's mystique in a 1983 interview in The New York Times.         ''May was very gentle, even then, and her classes had such an easy flow,'' he said. ''Complete journeys in themselves. I always wanted to get closer to her. But I was very shy.'' She taught only once a week, he said, adding: ''I'd think in between, 'Where does she go?' She'd bring in this wonderful, warm love and then disappear.''       
         Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Robert.         In 12 books and many other writings, Dr. McCord, a professor at Temple University, disputed the effectiveness in fighting crime of boys' clubs, summer camps, programs in which young offenders visit prisons, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and other popular programs.         The first woman to be president of the American Society of Criminology, she was known for her use of longitudinal studies, which follow subjects for many years. Her goal was to examine the long-term effects of programs, ranging from individual mentoring programs often favored by conservatives to social work efforts frequently advocated by liberals.         Dr. McCord believed that just as the government monitors the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, the public should examine data to determine if well-meaning interventions to help people might, in fact, be harmful. Often, she found that programs had no built-in procedure to evaluate their success.         More troubling, she said, was that officials sometimes resisted evaluation of programs, in part because they regarded it as an affront to their good intentions. She also said she sensed a fear that solid criticism of one social program might brand all as ineffective.         ''That fear, perhaps justified in some quarters, would be like blocking publication of damaging effects of Celebrex, thalidomide, or estrogen because the publication could slow work in disease prevention,'' she wrote in the May 2003 issue of The Annals, the publication of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.         Her best-known longitudinal study was her 1978 follow-up on a youth-mentoring program done 30 years earlier in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass. She found that boys at high risk who had been given mentors, health-care services and summer camp fared worse in later life than a similar group of boys who were given nothing special. The 250 boys who got special services were more likely to become criminals, have trouble in their jobs and marriages, and become alcoholics, according to court, hospital and other records noted in her study.         A possible reason, Dr. McCord suggested, was that those boys had felt they were given the attention because something was wrong with them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Her theory was that the boys who went to summer camp modeled themselves after camp troublemakers.         The counterintuitive result contradicted the statements of two-thirds of the participants that the program had helped them by giving them better values and keeping them off the streets.         In other studies, she found that some youths counseled by court-appointed volunteers fared worse than those who received no counseling. Her statistical analysis of a program in Australia that provided recreation for troubled adolescents found bad effects. And participants in the Scared Straight program, which takes young offenders from many locales to visit prisons, were arrested more often than a control group, she found.         She said that D.A.R.E., the popular nationwide ''just say no'' drug education program in which law enforcement officers spend time in schools talking about drugs, alcohol and violence, may actually have contributed to drug use, according to her analysis of statistics from the program.         Joan Fish was born in Manhattan on Aug. 4, 1930. After graduating from Stanford in 1952, she did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard and Stanford. She earned her doctorate in sociology from Stanford in 1968.         She wrote some of her early papers with her first husband, William M. McCord. Their marriage ended in divorce. Both he and her second husband, Carl A. Silver, are dead.         Dr. McCord is survived by her sons, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord of Durham, N.C., and Robert McCord of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; her ward, whom she regarded as a family member, Tom Underwood of Boston; her brother, Robert Fish of Santa Cruz, Calif.; her sister, Connie Arnosti of Milwaukee; and four grandsons.         Her often pithy remarks appeared in articles about crime in many newspapers and magazines. The New York Times in 1996 asked her about a 12-year-old arrested on charges of gang rape and murder and who was turned in by his mother.         Of the mother's dilemma, Dr. McCord said, ''It's almost impossible to imagine a good thing to do with a gun-toting 12-year-old.''       
         Joan Cullman, a Tony Award-winning producer on Broadway, died yesterday at her winter home in Tryall, Jamaica. She was 72 and also had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Tracy Straus.         Ms. Cullman was a producer of at least nine Broadway shows, including Yasmina Reza's ''Art,'' which won the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play in 1998.         She was also a producer of several Tony-nominated plays and musicals, including David Hare's ''Skylight'' in 1996, ''Sweet Smell of Success'' in 2002 and ''The Play What I Wrote'' last year.         Her other Broadway shows include ''The Rink,'' a musical written by Terrence McNally with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb; Mr. Hare's ''Judas Kiss,'' and ''Carmelina.''         Ms. Cullman was a vice chairwoman of the board of the Lincoln Center Theater and had served on the board there since 1985. At Lincoln Center she was the chairwoman of the patrons' committee and founded the Joan Cullman Award for Extraordinary Creativity, a cash prize that has been given to Tom Stoppard, Stockard Channing, Julie Taymor, Spalding Gray and others.         Born Joan Paley in Far Rockaway, Queens, she graduated from Brooklyn College and began her career as an assistant to Stan Lee, the creator of ''Spider-Man'' and other comic books.         Her marriage to Barnard Sachs Straus ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter, she is survived by her husband Joseph F. Cullman III of Manhattan, the chairman emeritus of the Philip Morris Companies in New York; a son, Barney Straus Jr., of Evanston, Ill.; a brother, Leon Paley of Far Rockaway; and a grandson.       
         Ella Johnson, a jazz singer who performed with her brother Buddy Johnson in his dance bands in the 1940's and 50's, died in New York on Feb. 16, her nephew James Johnson Jr. said. She was 86.         A smooth singer with a seductive delivery, Ms. Johnson was often compared to Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. But as a part of her brother's rollicking bands, she also helped forge a link to R&B and early rock 'n' roll.         Ms. Johnson was born in Darlington, S.C., and moved to New York to join Buddy, her older brother, while still in her teens. Though only two years older than Ella, Buddy had become an established musician in New York and was leading groups at the Savoy Ballroom and elsewhere.         Her first hit with Buddy was ''Please, Mr. Johnson'' in 1940, and she continued to record and perform with him into the 1960's. Among her best-known songs was ''Since I Fell for You (1945), a ballad written by Buddy that was later performed by Mel Tormé and George Shearing, Annie Laurie, Lenny Welch and others.         She also sang ''When My Man Comes Home,'' ''Hittin' on Me,'' ''Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?'' and ''I Don't Want Nobody.''         Among her survivors are her husband, Odell Day; four brothers, Edward Parrott and Earl Johnson of Darlington, and Allan and Wesley Parrott of New York; a sister, Hattie Miller of Landover, Md.; and a granddaughter, Lisa.       
         Rosemary Park Anastos, an advocate for women's education and the liberal arts and a former president of Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women, died April 17 at her home in Los Angeles, said a niece, Joan Citron. She was 97.         Dr. Park, as she was known professionally, came from a family of academics: her mother was a teacher, her father and brother were also college presidents. When she left the Barnard presidency in 1967 after five years, she became the first woman to be a vice chancellor at the University of California. At her Barnard inauguration in 1963, she said that ''to avoid becoming a nursery school to the university with custodial and elementary responsibilities only,'' the college must make its liberal arts more sophisticated. She said that meant moving beyond acquiring facts to the mastery of subjects like advanced mathematics, political and economic theory and classical philosophy.         At Connecticut, where she was president from 1947 to 1962, she expanded the student body by one-third, strengthened the curriculum, built major new buildings and was a tireless fund-raiser. She made the campus a national center for modern dance and generally enhanced the college's reputation. When Yale gave her an honorary degree in 1958, it said she had been a major force in ''adding a bright star to the galaxy of liberal arts colleges for women.''         At Barnard, she followed a similar agenda, strengthening the curriculum, adding major buildings and raising money. But she left after five years, pulled by her marriage in 1965 to Milton Vasil Anastos, a professor of Byzantine Greek at the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in 1997. Dr. Park is survived by her stepson, Milton V. Anastos Jr., of Warwick, R.I., and several nieces and nephews.         Of her departure for California, David Truman, dean of Columbia College, wrote in Barnard's alumnae magazine that although she was the only woman at many Columbia meetings, her wisdom and humor gave weight to her advice and made her ''one of the best men in the university.''         Not all of her dealings with Columbia were harmonious, however, as she related in an interview with Helen S. Astin, a U.C.L.A. colleague, in ''The Higher Education of Women: Essays in Honor of Rosemary Park.'' When she proposed a new science laboratory for Barnard, she said, Columbia discouraged her, saying its labs were sufficient. But, she said, Barnard did not control those labs, and the absence of its own lab would send a signal ''that it didn't believe in science for women.'' Barnard built a new lab.         Born in Andover, Mass., Dr. Park was the oldest of four children of J. Edgar Park, a minister raised in Ireland who became president of Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, and Grace Burtt Park, who taught Greek and mathematics. Her brother, William E. Park, was president of Simmons College, in Boston.         She studied German at Radcliffe and graduated summa cum laude. She later studied at the University of Bonn in 1930 and in 1934 earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cologne. She began teaching German part time, first at Wheaton, then at Connecticut College, where she became dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, then president.         She spoke and wrote widely on education, the role of women and other topics, often breaking from conventional wisdom. She told parents that they should encourage their children to take courses in advanced mathematics and French, because society would need scientists and linguists. She said that schools facing teacher shortages should think about using television and older students to help with the teaching; both, she said, had proved effective.         She often leavened her seriousness with wit. In one speech, she took a swipe at English usage: ''At some point in most of the professions, the regrettable expression 'load' arose: case load, patient load, teaching load,'' she said. ''Artists, as far as I know, do not refer to picture load, poem load or concert load.''         Although she supported women's education, she was not a zealot. In her interview with Dr. Astin, Dr. Park said that women's colleges were ''particularly important for girls who develop slowly,'' but said men might benefit ''from the same kind of protective environment.'' She predicted that women's colleges would become less necessary, and she won authority to establish Connecticut College for Men and then admitted men as graduate students.         She was an energetic fund-raiser at a time when it was not always viewed as dignified. To raise $3.1 million for Connecticut College, she crossed the country, meeting with executives who questioned the need to finance women's education.         She became a vice chancellor at U.C.L.A. in 1967, and then a professor. In 1980, she helped develop the Plato Society, a U.C.L.A. study program for retired people. Until a few months ago, she was a member herself, taking courses like ''Romantic Composers'' and ''Brain and Memory.''       
         Timi Yuro, the pop singer whose throaty and soulful delivery made ''Hurt'' and other songs hits in the early 1960's, died on March 30 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said her niece, Michelle Duval.         Ms. Yuro's hits, like ''I Apologize,'' ''For the Love of a Boy'' and ''What's a Matter Baby (Is It Hurting You),'' featured her husky alto rising to dramatic climaxes above gentle orchestral accompaniment.         Her songs had the sentimentality of teenage pop, but in her vocals Ms. Yuro borrowed the bluesy intensity of black jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson.         Ms. Yuro began her career with ''Hurt,'' which reached the Top 10 in 1961, and it remained her signature song. Though recorded when she was barely out of her teens, she sang it with a strength and finesse that earned her a reputation as a soul powerhouse; her voice was often mistaken for that of a black woman or a man.         Born Rosemary Timotea Aurro in Chicago, she moved to Los Angeles as a child and began singing in her family's Italian restaurant. She signed with Liberty Records in 1959 and recorded ''Hurt'' with Clyde Otis, who had been a producer for Dinah Washington. The song, which had first been an R & B hit for Roy Hamilton in 1953, was later sung by Elvis Presley and Juice Newton.         Ms. Yuro had a string of hits with Liberty until she left the label in 1964, when she began recording with Mercury and other companies. She quit in the 1970's and her attempts to return to music in the early 80's were stymied by throat cancer.         She is survived by her husband, Robert Selnick, of Las Vegas, from whom she had separated; a daughter, Milan Reinoehl; a brother, Anthony; and three grandchildren.       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Virginia Capers, an actress and singer who won a Tony Award in 1974 for her role in ''Raisin,'' the musical version of ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' died on Thursday in Los Angeles. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         She died after a bout of pneumonia, said her son, Glenn Capers.         Ms. Capers was an experienced but little-known character actress when she was cast as Lena Younger, the matriarch of the struggling working-class black family in ''Raisin,'' a musical that opened in the fall of 1973, based on Lorraine Hansberry's play. But Ms. Capers's intense stage presence captivated critics. In his review for The New York Times, Clive Barnes called her ''a vast and loving Gibraltar of a woman'' and said she was ''tremendous in just about every sense you can use the word.''         Ms. Capers won the Tony for best actress in a musical. The show, which also starred Deborah Allen, Ernestine Jackson and Joe Morton, was nominated for nine Tonys, and also won for best musical. It ran on Broadway for more than two years and had a long life as a touring show.         Eliza Virginia Capers was born in Sumter, S.C., and attended Howard University and the Juilliard School. She began performing in Yiddish theater and by the late 1950's had made her way to Broadway. She was an understudy for Adelaide Hall in ''Jamaica,'' which opened in 1957, and in 1959 she was in the cast of ''Saratoga,'' the Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer musical.         Before ''Raisin,'' Ms. Capers worked extensively in television and in the movies, appearing on ''The Untouchables,'' ''Have Gun, Will Travel,'' ''Mannix'' and ''Dragnet,'' among many other shows. In the 1972 film ''Lady Sings the Blues,'' she played the mother to Diana Ross's Billie Holiday, and she was also in ''Trouble Man'' and ''The Lost Man.'' After ''Raisin,'' she appeared on the television shows ''Frank's Place,'' ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' and ''The Hughleys.''         Besides her son, of Los Angeles, she is survived by a brother, James H. Capers, of New York.       
         Joan Stitt McMenamin, who retired in 1992 after 21 years as head of the Nightingale-Bamford School, a college preparatory school for girls, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 79.         Her death was announced by the school, where she became the fifth headmistress in 1971.         Mrs. McMenamin arrived at the school, which is on East 92nd Street, 10 years earlier for a few weeks to help the office cope with a spate of final reports.         She stayed to teach history, then became the assistant headmistress to Catherine Woodbridge, whom she later succeeded.         Reared in Scarsdale, N.Y., she attended the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., graduated from Smith College in 1946 and studied at the Katherine Gibbs Secretarial School.         She went to Paris in 1949 to work for the Marshall Plan administration, then became an office manager for the Ford Foundation in New York before joining Nightingale-Bamford. After retiring, Mrs. McMenamin was interim head of San Francisco University High School in the late 1990's.         Mrs. McMenamin's husband of 51 years, Edward B. McMenamin, a former secretary of Columbia University, died in 1994. She is survived by two sisters, Barbara Greene of Jacksonville, Fla., and Britton Stitt of San Francisco.         Correction:  June 17, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Joan Stitt McMenamin, former headmistress of the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, misstated the day of her death and referred incorrectly to one survivor. Ms. McMenamin died last Friday, not Saturday. Britton Stitt of San Francisco was her brother, not her sister.       
         Emma Buck, who ran a pre-Civil War family farm in Illinois that remained virtually unchanged into the 21st century, died on June 5 on the sleigh bed with handmade ticking she had slept in for 98 years, in the log cabin built by her great-uncle, a German immigrant, in 1849.         She was 100 or 101, said Annie Rieken, a close friend and director of the Heritage Foundation of Monroe County, where the farm is located. The cause of death was breast cancer, Ms. Rieken said.         The 70-acre farm, a sort of rural Smithsonian, was named one of the state's 10 most endangered sites in 1998 by the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. Miss Buck, who had pulled the last of her own teeth some years ago, lived there without running water, drawing her water from a well. Until two days before she died, she walked to the outhouse, one of many structures on the farm.         It also has a blacksmith's shop, a smokehouse, a butchering shed, a threshing barn and a rare outdoor bake oven.         Miss Buck sharpened scythes on a foot-operated grinding wheel well into her 90's. Speaking with a thick German accent, the slightly persnickety Miss Buck always wore a skirt as she worked.         ''Emma could be blunt and coarse and uncouth by Emily Post standards,'' Ms. Rieken said. ''But there was a total authenticity about her.''         To spend time with Miss Buck was to feel the evocative power of a place that has all but vanished from the American landscape, a fragile holdover where it was possible to encounter wooden butter churns, hobnail boots, copper kettles for making sausage and apple butter and hoops for a Conestoga wagon in the rafters.         ''That was German business,'' she once said speaking of the heavy trough in the smokehouse, used to scald the fur off carcasses, and her other implements. ''What would you do with all these things? Throw them out?''         While contemporaries embraced tractors and other modern machinery, the Buck family stuck to the old ways. The farm was settled by Miss Buck's maternal great-grandparents, Christian and Christina Henke, German immigrants from East Friesland who came by boat from New Orleans and settled in western Illinois, about 35 miles down river from St. Louis, in 1841. As was the custom among German families in the area, Emma and her sister Anna, who died in 1992, worked side by side with their father, Fred, who died in 1966. A brother, Albert, died in 1999. Emma Buck never married and leaves no survivors.         ''The Buck farmstead is a rare glimpse into the past,'' said Mike Jackson, chief architect with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. ''It is an extremely well-preserved place, maintained by a woman who lived a 19th-century life throughout the 20th century. Its significance is far greater than its humble origins.''         In 1999, Miss Buck deeded the property to Ahne Road Farms Inc., a nonprofit foundation in nearby Waterloo created with her lawyer, Otto Faulbaum, to preserve the farm as a historic site and interpretive center.         The goal is to inventory the farm's historic buildings and to lay the groundwork for long-term stewardship. ''Farms like Emma's were once common in the Midwest, but everybody else is gone and now the antiques are hanging in some suburban ranch house somewhere,'' Mr. Faulbaum said. ''We would like to restore the whole place as a living history museum and to preserve the farm intact.''         Miss Buck was buried June 6, in the old-fashioned way: by friends and neighbors who lowered her pine coffin into the ground in a corner of the cornfield, the stalks waist high.         She had left clear instructions. ''She said she didn't want an open casket,'' Ms. Rieken said. ''She said, 'If people couldn't visit me alive, they have no business visiting me as a dirty old dead woman.'''         Before covering the coffin, friends threw oranges onto the vault, recalling a story Miss Buck would tell about her grandmother Christina Bode. When German settlers heard there was sickness aboard the ship that brought her from Germany, they rowed into the harbor and tossed oranges onto the deck.         ''Life is like that ship,'' Miss Buck would say. ''Sometimes it blows forward, sometimes back. And just when you think all is lost, someone throws an orange on your deck.''       
         Elizabeth Shub, a distinguished editor and translator of children's books from German and Yiddish, especially those of Isaac Bashevis Singer, whom she knew from her childhood and encouraged to write for children, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Her death was announced by Virginia Duncan, the publisher of Greenwillow Books.         Mrs. Shub (pronounced SHOOB) was born in Poland and was brought to New York in 1919. Her father, Samuel Charney, also known as Shmuel Niger, was the literary critic for The Day, a Yiddish newspaper, and he and his wife ran a literary salon in their home in New York.         Mrs. Shub's younger brother, Dr. William Charney, a microbiologist, was known for his work on the development of prednisone and prednisolone, the synthetic corticosteroids.         After she and her husband, Boris Shub, divorced, she drifted into publishing. The couple had no children.         Mrs. Shub was first hired by Susan Hirschman as a freelance reader in the children's department at Harper & Row. She became an associate editor there before moving to Charles Scribner's Sons, then followed Mrs. Hirschman to the children's book department at Macmillan. When Mrs. Hirschman founded Greenwillow Books in 1974, Mrs. Shub became senior editor, a position she held until her retirement in 1996. In the 1960's, when she was an established editor, she suggested to Singer that he consider writing for children. ''Zlateh the Goat, and Other Stories'' appeared in 1966 and was followed by 10 other children's books.         In addition to translating folk tales and Yiddish stories for children, she wrote several children's books herself, including ''The White Stallion'' (1982), a popular novel..         In a published interview she said that as both an editor and a writer she had respect for writers' instincts, and that ''if I make suggestions on how something in a manuscript might be changed, I always let the writers fix it their own way.''       
         Naomi Shemer, an Israeli poet and a prolific composer whose popular songs include ''Jerusalem of Gold,'' which became interwoven with the culture of the Jewish state, died on Saturday at a Tel Aviv hospital after a long illness. She was 74.         Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moshe Katsav were among the thousands of mourners at her funeral on Sunday at Kibbutz Kinneret, the place of her birth.         Mr. Sharon had begun the weekly cabinet meeting earlier that day by paying tribute to Ms. Shemer, calling her a woman who ''managed, with her beautiful melodies, to connect us to our roots,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         ''Jerusalem of Gold'' was written just before the 1967 Middle East war, in which Israel seized control of the city from Jordan. The ballad made her famous as it gained the status of an informal second national anthem once Israel had ''reunited'' the ancient city.         In the song, Ms. Shemer called on the emotions evoked by thoughts of the Old City and Judaism's holiest sites. Making the city whole realized a dream almost two millennia after the destruction of its last Jewish temple.         Ms. Shemer captured the spirit of that victorious moment when Israel asserted itself by adding another verse after the war to celebrate the event. The song is often heard at public ceremonies and on the radio in Israel.         Another popular Shemer song was based on the Beatles' ''Let It Be.'' Through it she sought to restore hope in Israelis after the costly war with Egypt and Syria in 1973.         She complemented her original work with Hebrew adaptations of foreign poetry. After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, she rendered Walt Whitman's ''O Captain! My Captain!'' into Hebrew, set it to music and dedicated it to the slain prime minister.         Ms. Shemer, whose parents helped found Kibbutz Kinneret, grew up with singalongs. She studied at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem, and served with an entertainment unit in the Israeli Army. Returning to the kibbutz, she taught rhythm in school and began to write children's songs. Her career broadened after she moved to Tel Aviv in the mid-1950's. Her songs often recalled the landscapes of her childhood, but she could just as easily relate to contemporary Israeli city scenes.         Teddy Kollek, who was elected mayor of Jerusalem in 1965, commissioned her to write a hymn to the city. It was first heard at the Israel Song Festival in Jerusalem. Then, after the war of 1967, she added a verse that included the lyrics, ''Back to the wells and to the fountains, within the ancient walls.''         In 1983 she was given the Israel Prize for her contributions to Israeli music. She also held several honorary doctorates, served as head of the Israeli entertainers' union, and was a member of the Hebrew Language Academy.         Ms. Shemer's first marriage, to Gideon Shemer, ended in divorce. According to the daily newspaper Haaretz, she is survived by her second husband, Mordechai Horowitz; their son, Daniel; a daughter, Lali, from her first marriage; four grandchildren; a brother; and a sister.       
         Karol Kennedy Kucher, who teamed up with her brother, Peter Kennedy, to win the gold medal in pairs at the 1950 world figure-skating championships and a silver medal at the 1952 Winter Olympics, died on Friday at a hospital in Seattle. She was 72.         The cause was pneumonia, her brother said.         Karol and Peter Kennedy, known as the Kennedy Kids, were the dominant American pair skaters in the years after World War II, winning five consecutive United States championships, from 1948 to 1952.         The Kennedys became the first American pair to win a world championship when they captured the gold medal at Wembley Stadium in London in 1950.         Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner are the only other American pair skaters to have won a world championship, at Vienna in 1979.         The Kennedys were the second American pair to win Olympic silver when they were runners-up to Ria and Paul Falk of West Germany at the 1952 Oslo Games. Beatrix Loughran and Sherwin Badger, at Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1932, and Kitty and Peter Carruthers, at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, in 1984, are the only other American pair skaters to have captured Olympic silver. No American pair has won a gold medal at the Olympics.         The Kennedys also won the 1949 and the 1951 North American Figure Skating Championships.         They were named to the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame at Colorado Springs in 1991.         Karol and Peter Kennedy began skating together at a rink in Olympia, Wash., when she was 8 and he was 12. As Peter Kennedy recalled yesterday in a telephone interview, they were naturals.         ''We never really had to work at learning to skate,'' he said.         Their father, Michael, a dentist, helped oversee their training, and their mother, Clarice, designed their costumes.         Having finished sixth in the 1948 Winter Olympics at St. Moritz, Switzerland, the Kennedys were narrow runners-up to the Falks in the 1952 Oslo Games. A week later, the Kennedys were second to the Falks again, this time at the world championships in Paris.         The Kennedys retired from competition soon afterward. Karol was married in 1953, settled in Seattle with her husband, Robert Kucher, and operated a clothing store. Peter Kennedy, who lives in Mercer Island, Wash., became a competitive skier and designed skiing equipment.         In addition to her husband and her brother, Karol Kennedy Kucher is survived by two sons, John, of Seattle, and Charlie, of Hailey, Idaho; four daughters, Kathryn Etherington, of Wenatchee, Wash.; Mary Jane Kucher, of California, and Heidi Pray and Suzanne Sanchez, both of Seattle, and five grandchildren.         Peter Kennedy attributed much of the team's success to his father having taught them perseverance.         ''He preached to us, 'You don't give up.''' Kennedy said.       
         Paula Danziger, who established herself as a writer of popular fiction for young readers with her first book, ''The Cat Ate My Gymsuit,'' died on Thursday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59.         The cause was complications of a heart attack she suffered on June 9, said Doug Whiteman, president of Penguin Young Readers Group, the publisher of most of her books.         Her smart-talking fictional voice, making light of family problems large and small, carried through a 30-year career in which she wrote more than 30 books.         Ms. Danziger was born in Washington and reared in Metuchen, N.J. She earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in education from Montclair State College.         Although she wanted to be a writer, Ms. Danziger began working as a substitute teacher in 1967 and taught at the junior high school level for several years. After being injured in two automobile accidents, she decided not to postpone her ambition any longer and wrote her first book.         Building on the success of ''Gymsuit,'' Ms. Danziger also became a popular speaker. She decked herself out with rhinestone-trimmed glasses, feather hats and beaded outfits, talked fast and was funny.         She often said in interviews that her alternative career choice was stand-up comedian, and she was as glamorous to the school audiences she visited as Dame Edna Everage. Moreover, to the delight of her young fans, she could use mirror writing as well as a conventional signature when she autographed their books.         In 1994, in ''Amber Brown Is Not a Crayon,'' she introduced a deadpan heroine inspired by her niece, Carrie Danziger. The book led to two hugely popular series of Amber Brown adventures, the original for middle school students and a later one for early readers.         With her friend, Ann M. Martin, the author of ''The Baby Sitters Club'' series, Ms. Danziger also wrote two epistolary novels for slightly older readers, ''P.S. Longer Letter Later'' and ''Snail Mail No More.'' All of Ms. Danziger's books are in print in the United States, and many have been published in 53 countries and 14 languages.         Her survivors, in addition to her niece, are a brother, Barry Danziger of Califon, N.J., and three nephews.       
         Sandra Helen Payson, a socially prominent patron of the arts, died on July 15 in Manhattan, where she was visiting. A former New Yorker, she was 78 and lived in Washington and Delaplane, Va.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Payson was the founder and president of the Beard's Fund, through which she supported groups in the performing arts and individual artists. She also sponsored fellowships for aspiring artists.         The daughter of Charles Shipman Payson, an industrialist, and Joan Whitney Payson, founder of the New York Mets baseball team, she grew up in Manhasset, N.Y., where she founded the Manhasset Stable for thoroughbred racing, which she later moved to Delaplane.         She was a board member of the Lincoln Center Institute for Arts in Education, the Whitney Museum, the Madeira School and the Research Center at the New York Public Library. She also was active in the Women's Leadership Forum of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.         Her two marriages, to William Blair Meyer and George (later Lord) Weidenfeld of London, ended in divorce.         Ms. Payson is survived by a son, William Blair Meyer Jr. of Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Joan Curci Meyer of London and Porto Ercole, Italy, and Averil Payson Meyer of New York City and Katonah, N.Y.; two sisters, Payne Whitney Middleton of Manhattan, and Lorinda Payson deRoulet of Manhasset; a brother, John Whitney Payson of Jupiter Island, Fla.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Anne Gorsuch Burford, a Colorado conservative who was chosen by President Ronald Reagan as his top environmental regulator only to resign under Congressional fire 22 months later, died Sunday in Aurora, Colo. She was 62.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Stephanie Gorsuch of Denver, said.         In appointing her administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, President Reagan made Ms. Burford a leader in his effort to bring economic discipline to environmental cleanup and to give the states greater enforcement powers on matters like clean air and water, policies she had earlier advocated on the state level. Critics contended that the policies weakened federal environmental enforcement to please polluting industries.         This fundamental difference in perspective reached a climax in a battle between a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, which demanded thousands of pages of documents relating to toxic waste cleanup, and Ms. Burford, who refused to hand them over. She said she would go to jail rather than surrender them to Congress.         Eventually, the White House gave up its claim of executive privilege to keep the documents secret, and Ms. Burford resigned on March 9, 1983.         In her tenure as the second-ranking woman in the Reagan administration, after the United Nations Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Ms. Burford showed sharp intelligence, as well as a taste for confrontation with environmental groups.         Environmentalists like Gaylord Nelson, chairman of the Wilderness Society, accused her of ''a wholesale dismantling'' of environmental advances, but Ms. Burford insisted that she was bringing cost-effective market forces to the regulation of pollution.         Anne Irene McGill was born on April 21, 1942, in Casper, Wyo. Her father, a surgeon, moved the family to Denver when she was an infant.         She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in two years and finished law school there at 20, then became the youngest woman admitted to the Colorado bar. She used a Fulbright scholarship to study criminal law in India.         She worked for a bank and then as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson County, Colo., and as deputy district attorney for the City of Denver. After working at two state regulatory agencies, she became a lawyer for Mountain Bell Telephone.         In 1976, she was elected to the first of two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of a group that called itself the Crazies for its members' passionate devotion to states' rights and opposition to federal energy and environmental policies. She was named outstanding freshman legislator and worked on legislation concerning hazardous wastes and vehicle emissions.         In 1964, she married David Gorsuch, whom she divorced in 1982. The next year, she married Robert Burford, a rancher who was then head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. He died in 1993, while divorce proceedings were in progress. Ms. Burford returned to private law practice after her resignation.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her sons, J.J. Gorsuch of Denver and Neil Gorsuch of Vienna, Va.; her mother, Dorothy McGill of Denver; her sisters, Mary Edwards of Severna Park, Md., Theresa Peace of Lincoln, Neb., Dorothy McGill of El Paso, Tex., Veronica Urban of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Rosie Binger of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, Joe McGill of Plano, Tex.; and four grandchildren.         James Watt, who became Mr. Reagan's interior secretary, and James Coors, the Colorado brewing and energy magnate, sponsored Ms. Burford for the E.P.A. post. Her confirmation was held up for months as senators debated her qualifications and questioned her agenda, but the outcome was never in serious doubt.         When her nomination hearing was finally held on May 1, 1981, she began by speaking lyrically of her own environment.         ''As a long-term Coloradan,'' she said, ''I come before you with a deep appreciation of the unique beauties which we enjoy in our environment -- the majesty and grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the openness and sense of space of our eastern plains.''       
         Lilian Moore, a writer of books for children, a poet and an editor who helped make children's books more affordable and worked to combat racial stereotypes in children's literature, died July 20 at her home in Seattle, said her son, Jonathan. She was 95.         A longtime resident of New York City, Ms. Moore was an editor at Scholastic when she suggested in 1957 that the company make its books more accessible by offering low-cost paperbacks through the mail; there were few paperback books for children at the time. She became the first editor of Scholastic's Arrow Book Club, a series of inexpensive editions for pupils in the fourth through sixth grades, and the Lucky Book Club, a similar program for younger readers.         Seven years later, after her stepson, Richard Moore, returned from a summer of civil-rights work in Mississippi and told her that black children there had no books about their own experience, she helped establish the Council on Interracial Books for Children. The council works to discover and encourage minority writers and to confront stereotypes in books for children.         Ms. Moore was also a prolific writer of children's books, including ''Old Rosie, the Horse Nobody Understood'' (1960).         Her ''Little Raccoon'' series, which is still in print in the United States, was translated into Russian and has sold more than 375,000 copies in Russia.         Ms. Moore began writing poetry for children in the late 1960's. In books including ''I Thought I Heard the City'' and ''Sam's Place: Poems From the Country,'' she explored her own childhood memories and wrote about the joy of finding beauty in familiar and unexpected places.         Born Lilian Levenson in the Bronx in 1909 to Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Russia, she graduated from Hunter College in 1930. Unable to find a permanent teaching job during the Depression, she joined the Unemployed Teachers Council and edited its newspaper, The Unemployed Teacher.         As a part-time teacher working with truants, she discovered her ability to help children learn to read. She eventually became a reading specialist in the New York City school system and began writing for children soon after, publishing her first stories in Humpty Dumpty's Magazine.         She is survived by a son from her second marriage, Jonathan Moore of Seattle, and a brother, Milton Levenson of Manhattan. Her third husband, Sam Reavin, died in the early 1990's. Ms. Moore's final books, ''Mural on Second Avenue, and Other City Poems'' and ''Scary Poems,'' will be published posthumously.         Correction:  August 5, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Lilian Moore, a children's author, misstated her role with Scholastic's Lucky Book Club for younger pupils. She was not its first editor; that was the writer and poet Beatrice Schenck de Regniers. (Ms. Moore was, however, the first editor of the company's Arrow Book Club, for pupils in Grades 4 to 6.)       
         Helen K. Copley, former publisher of The San Diego Union-Tribune and its predecessors and a prominent philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the newspaper said.         Mrs. Copley began working at the Union Tribune Publishing Company as a secretary in 1953. She became the publisher in 1973, taking the position after the death of her husband, James S. Copley. She retired in 2001.         Until 1992, the company's two flagship newspapers, The San Diego Union and its afternoon sister paper, The San Diego Tribune, were the major competing papers in the city. Responding to declining circulation numbers and a drop in advertising, Mrs. Copley merged the two papers into The Union-Tribune, a morning paper. It is now the third-largest newspaper in California, with a daily circulation of 355,000. The Sunday circulation is 445,000.         As the population grew in San Diego, Mrs. Copley dealt with growing competition from smaller papers and a regional edition of The Los Angeles Times. In her first years as publisher, she sought to meet with all 1,500 employees of the company in small groups in an effort to improve morale. Under her tenure, The San Diego Tribune won two Pulitzer prizes.         Copley Press Inc., which owns the Union-Tribune Publishing Company, publishes eight other daily newspapers, in California, Illinois and Ohio. Keeping Copley Press in family hands was a priority for Mrs. Copley, and she turned it over to her son, David C. Copley, when she retired.         Margaret Helen Kinney was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Nov. 28, 1922. After a stint in the Waves in the 1940's and a brief marriage, she moved to San Diego with her mother in 1951.         In 1953, Mrs. Copley answered an ad for a job at the Union Tribune Publishing Company. She began working as a secretary for Mr. Copley, who had become chief executive of Copley Press after the death of his father, Ira C. Copley, who started the company in 1905. In 1965, she married Mr. Copley; eight years later, he died of brain cancer.         Mrs. Copley, whose worth was estimated to be $960 million by Forbes magazine last year, gave millions to the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. She also underwrote the construction of a library at the University of San Diego.         In addition to her son, David, of La Jolla, Mrs. Copley's survivors include a sister, Mary Frances Davison of Santa Maria, Calif.; a brother, Frank E. Kinney of Cedar Rapids; and two stepchildren from her husband's first marriage, Michael Copley of San Diego and Janice Obre of New York.       
         Laura Branigan, a singer whose high-volume vocals in the disco-style song ''Gloria'' propelled her into pop stardom, died in her sleep Thursday night at her home in East Quogue, N.Y. She was 47.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her brother Mark Branigan.         After touring as a backup singer with Leonard Cohen, Ms. Branigan released her first album, ''Branigan,'' in 1982. It included ''Gloria,'' which became a hit, lasting on the pop charts for 36 weeks.         Other hits followed, including ''Solitaire,'' ''How Am I Supposed to Live Without You?'' and ''Self Control,'' although she continued to be most known for ''Gloria,'' her brother said.         After her husband, Larry Kruteck, died in 1996, she took time off from her music career.         In 2002, she starred in ''Love, Janis,'' an Off Broadway musical about Janis Joplin. At the time of her death, she was midway through work on new album, Mr. Branigan said.         Ms. Branigan was born on July 3, 1957, in Westchester County, N.Y. She attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan.         She is survived by her mother, Kathleen, who lived with her in East Quogue; two brothers, Mark and Billy, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Susan, of Connecticut.       
         Geraldine Peroni, an Academy Award-nominated film editor known for her work with Robert Altman, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan, said her sister, Pamela O'Grady. She was 51.         The New York City medical examiner's office ruled the death a suicide, but Ms. Peroni's family is disputing that finding.         Ms. Peroni was Mr. Altman's favorite editor and worked on eight of his films beginning with ''Vincent & Theo'' in 1990 and continuing through ''The Company'' last year.         She was nominated for an Oscar for her editing of ''The Player'' in 1992. She also edited Mr. Altman's ''Short Cuts,'' ''Prêt-à-Porter,'' ''Kansas City,'' ''Gingerbread Man'' and ''Dr. T and the Women.''         Over the years Mr. Altman developed a close working relationship with Ms. Peroni and often praised her work and her judgment as being an essential part of his movie making.         ''It gets to the point where I could be shooting a scene and a little bird will jump into my ear and say, 'Gerri's not going to like this,''' Mr. Altman said in a recent interview in DGA magazine, a publication of the Directors Guild of America.         Ms. Peroni was born in Manhattan and raised in Rockaway Beach, Queens.         She studied film at Hunter College, and her first job in the movies was as an editorial apprentice on the 1983 film ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.''         She was the first assistant editor, under Thelma Schoonmaker, on Martin Scorsese's ''Last Temptation of Christ'' (1988) and received her first credit as editor on ''Iron & Silk'' (1990).         She also edited ''Johnny Suede'' and ''The Safety of Objects,'' among other films.         Besides her sister, of Belle Harbor, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Peter, of Ormond Beach, Fla.       
         Leslie Revsin, a culinary trailblazer who achieved celebrity early in her career as the first woman to work as a chef in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, died on Monday at her home in Shoreline, Wash., a suburb of Seattle. She was 59.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Philip Carlson.         In the early 1970's, when Ms. Revsin graduated from the hotel and restaurant program at New York Technical College in Brooklyn, there were very few well-known young Americans, let alone women, in the field of fine cuisine. One of her instructors encouraged her to apply for a job at the Waldorf, and in 1972 she started on the bottom rung as a ''kitchen man.'' A year later she was promoted to fish chef and achieved national renown.         In 1977 after a brief stint as the chef at P.S. 77, an outpost of fine dining on the Upper West Side, she opened her own place, Restaurant Leslie, on Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village, with nine tables and a highly personal interpretation of nouvelle cuisine. That was when her name became forever associated with Roquefort beignets on apple purée. Restaurant Leslie closed in 1981. It was the last time Ms. Revsin was her own boss.         She worked at many well-known Manhattan restaurants, starting with 24 Fifth Avenue in 1982, and including Bridge Cafe. Her job at Argenteuil ended abruptly in February 1988 after a dispute with Paul Gregory, the restaurant's owner.         In 1990 she became the chef at the Inn at Pound Ridge in Pound Ridge, N.Y., where she remained until 1995. It was her longest and last kitchen position. Her lengthy résumé in the kitchen ended with her eventual career shift from restaurant chef to consultant, television cook and cookbook author.         Her name began to appear on lists of top American chefs starting in 1983. In 1985 she was featured on a cooking series on public television, and she was on other television cooking shows for many years. She also wrote for several food magazines and became a spokeswoman and consultant for a pantry full of products, including olive oil, strawberries, catfish and Alaskan seafood.         In 1997 her first cookbook, ''Delicious Dinners From Fillets and Shellfish,'' was published by Doubleday, followed in 2003 by ''Come for Dinner'' (John Wiley & Sons). Three additional cookbooks are scheduled to be published by John Wiley & Sons in September and March.         Leslie Kim Revsin was born on Oct. 19, 1944, in Chicago. She attended the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated in 1966 from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. She became devoted to fine French cuisine and sharpened her skills cooking at home in Brooklyn before enrolling in the professional course.         Her marriage to Bill Arp, a television producer, ended in divorce. In 1980 she married Mr. Carlson, a talent agent. Her illness was diagnosed about a year ago, when they were moving to the Seattle area to be near Ms. Revsin's daughter, Rachel Arp Ramstead, and her family.         In addition to her husband and daughter, Ms. Revsin is survived by a brother, Ethan Revsin, of New Albany, Ohio, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 30, 2004, Monday  An obituary of the chef and cookbook author Leslie Revsin on Aug. 13 misstated the title of her first book. It was ''Great Fish Quick''; the subtitle was ''Delicious Dinners From Fillets and Shellfish.'' The obituary also misspelled the surname of Ms. Revsin's surviving daughter. She is Rachel Ramstad, not Ramstead.       
         Elly Annie Schneider, who was known for many years in the circus world and on the big screen as Tiny Earles, then Tiny Doll, and who played one of the Munchkins in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' died here on Sept. 6. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Marlene Grunewald, a longtime friend who took care of her.         Ms. Schneider was born in Stolpen, Germany, in 1914, the youngest of nine children. She came to the United States in 1925 to join two sisters and a brother, all of short stature. Ms. Schneider herself was 39 inches tall and never weighed more than 46 pounds. She became an American citizen at 21.         At first the siblings in the United States used the name Earles, the last name of the man who brought them to America. They changed it to Doll after Mr. Earles died.         Before retiring in the mid-1950's, the Doll family -- Harry, Grace, Daisy and Tiny -- performed with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. They appeared in several films, among them a Laurel and Hardy short, ''Sailors, Beware!'' in 1927, and the cult classic ''Freaks'' in 1932.         The family moved here in 1934. All four siblings traveled to California to appear in ''The Wizard of Oz.''         Ms. Schneider, the last of the Doll family, left no immediate survivors. Until two months ago, she would entertain her many friends by singing songs from ''The Wizard of Oz'' and her circus shows.       
         Nuha al-Radi, the Iraqi artist and diarist whose work depicted her country's tribulations with a wry, impish wit, has died in Beirut. She was 63.         Ms. Radi died on Aug. 30, of pneumonia, her immune system severely weakened as a result of treatment for leukemia, said her sister, Selma al-Radi, speaking by telephone from the Lebanese capital.         Although both a ceramist and a painter, Ms. Radi was best known for her book ''Baghdad Diaries,'' a vivid account of the texture of daily life during the first gulf war and its aftermath, when she found shelter from the bombing in the family orchard in a well-to-do neighborhood.         ''The birds have taken the worst beating of all,'' she wrote. ''They have sensitive souls, which cannot take all this hideous noise and vibration. All the caged lovebirds have died from the shock of the blasts, while birds in the wild fly upside down and do crazy somersaults. Hundreds, if not thousands, have died in the orchard. Lonely survivors fly about in a distracted fashion.''         After the book was reissued last year in the wake of the second gulf war, Michiko Kakutani wrote in a review in The New York Times that ''the opening sections of these diaries give the reader a tactile and highly personal sense of how the allied bombing of Baghdad in 1991 affected ordinary Iraqi civilians. These descriptions can be read as a harbinger, in some respects, of residents' efforts to cope with the recent war and the continuing postwar upheaval.''         While not overtly political, Ms. Radi had no love for either the government controlling Iraq or for the United States for repeatedly causing destruction in Baghdad, her native city.         The book brims with criticism of the United States for making Iraqi civilians bear the brunt of the violence in their efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein, while depicting the grim resignation and black humor Iraqis used to survive under his violent rule.         She relates in matter-of-fact detail how a friend's nanny working in one of the presidential palaces told about what happens to thieves:         ''She said that when someone was caught stealing, they gathered the staff together, brought in a doctor, who chopped off this guy's hand, and immediately dunked it into boiling oil to cauterize it.''         The work also included jokes like the one about Mr. Hussein asking his cabinet members what time it is, with them responding in unison, ''Whatever time you want, sir.''         After her book's publication Ms. Radi, uncertain of the reaction from the government, chose to live in exile in Beirut, following something of a family tradition. She was born in 1941 in Baghdad. Her father was an Iraqi diplomat who served as the country's ambassador to Iran and India until the monarchy was overthrown in 1958.         The family later moved to Beirut, where her survivors still live periodically. They include her mother, Suad Munir Abbas; a brother, Abbad, of Abu Dhabi and Toronto, and her sister, Selma, a renowned archaeologist who has done extensive work on preserving historic buildings in Yemen.         In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Radi studied pottery at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London before moving to Beirut and teaching for a short period at the American University there. With the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon, she returned to Baghdad, where her work included several government commissions for large ceramic tableaus.         Ms. Radi used to joke that even the attempt to see her work was a perfect reflection of the turmoil in her country: one massive piece showing a magic carpet flight from ''1,001 Nights'' hung on a government building facing the Iranian Embassy while the other graced a presidential palace and was therefore off limits.         Taking visitors around the Iraqi capital in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, she would nod toward the work near the embassy and tell them not to point and not to take pictures and that stopping to look was certainly out of the question.         Her work often combined a certain whimsy with the darker aspects of life in the Middle East. One exhibition, titled ''Embargo Art,'' held in Amman during the late 1990's, a period of Western sanctions against Iraq, consisted of ''found objects'' like old mufflers from cars, the kind of things Iraqis had to use to get by, she said.         Ms. Radi was especially trenchant in describing the growing divide between the West and the Arab world, one to which she was particularly attuned, given her ease at working in both cultures.         In her diary, she tells of an encounter in Baghdad during which a woman wishes that some great catastrophe would ''envelop the U.S. and swallow the whole continent.'' When someone else in the conversation protests that his brothers living there would perish, the woman responds, ''They can go down with it.''         Last year, weeks after Mr. Hussein was overthrown, Ms. Radi went back to Baghdad to spend several weeks with her mother, who had refused to leave, comparing herself to Scarlett O'Hara after having survived so many wars in Iraq.         Ms. Radi, who usually managed to find a flower to tuck behind her ear every day no matter what war-ravaged city she was in, scampered through the wreckage of Mr. Hussein's compound and found happily that much of her large ceramic tableau of Iraq had survived the bombing unscathed.         She was somewhat less than enchanted with Iraq's latest overseers for failing to provide basic security and services, however, describing the new tenants of the presidential compound in an interview with The Times last year in her typically caustically droll manner:         ''America is in its ivory tower palace,'' she said, ''We are used to having coups and revolutions. But usually people who stage them take over the country afterward.''       
         Terry Dintenfass, a longtime New York art dealer whose gallery brought together several currents from outside the mainstream of 20th-century art, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         Her death was reported by her son Andrew Dintenfass.         For nearly 40 years the Terry Dintenfass gallery swam mostly against the tide of the rest of the art world. In the era of Pop and Minimal Art, Ms. Dintenfass was drawn to politically aware figurative painting rooted in the Social Realism of the 1930's.         She also represented the estates of first-generation American modernists like Arthur Dove and Charles Sheeler, as well as that of Ben Shahn.         At a time when nearly all artists showing in New York galleries were white, she represented several black artists, most notably Jacob Lawrence, but also Raymond Saunders, Richard Hunt and Walter Williams, a little-known painter whose work she showed in her first gallery, which was in Atlantic City.         She also represented the estate of Horace Pippin, a black folk artist, and worked on an important traveling exhibition of his work in 1977 that was organized by the Phillips Collection in Washington.         And, even though the line separating high and low culture was fairly firm, she also exhibited artists with a strong illustrational bent, like Ronald Markman, Richard Merkin and Robert Andrew Parker, as well as Edward Koren, a cartoonist for The New Yorker.         Ms. Dintenfass's life was an unusual mixture of propriety, activism and bohemianism. Born Theresa Kline on Easter in 1920, she grew up in Atlantic City, where her family owned a small department store.         She and her brother, Nathan S. Kline (author of ''From Sad to Glad,'' about depression), lived in a house full of art, books and music, with parents who wanted their children to be aware of people different from themselves.         Ms. Dintenfass attended finishing school in Virginia and studied art on and off for years, mostly at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art in Philadelphia. In 1938 she married a surgeon, Arthur Dintenfass, and had three children; after World War II they settled in Atlantic City, where she ran her husband's medical office for several years.         Using a small trust fund, Ms. Dintenfass began buying one painting every year, often from the Whitney Museum of American Art's annual exhibitions of painting and sculpture.         Her first galleries, called D Contemporary Gallery, were in Atlantic City hotels. She showed work on consignment from prominent New York dealers, and became especially close to Edith Gregor Halpert, whose Downtown Gallery represented several artists from the Alfred Stieglitz circle. She also sold the work of Milton Avery.         In 1959 she opened a gallery in a garden apartment at 18 East 67th Street in Manhattan, where she also lived for several years. In 1975 she moved her gallery to a large space in Manhattan, at 50 West 57th Street, and retired in 1999. Her business is now run by her son Andrew.         Ms. Dintenfass's first marriage and a brief second one ended in divorce. In 1976 she married James M. Reed, a career diplomat who also worked for the American Friends Service Committee. Mr. Reed died in 1985. In addition to Andrew, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., Ms. Dintenfass is survived by two other children from her first marriage, Dr. John Dintenfass of Manhattan and Susan Subtle Dintenfass of Berkeley, Calif.; and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara Schwei, a founder and the producer of the American Indian Dance Theater, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         The cause was breast cancer, according to Les Schecter, a friend.         Born in Milwaukee, Ms. Schwei received her degree in theater from New York University. She began her career in the late 1960's as a theatrical press agent. She was a producer of the 1973 Broadway stage musical ''Nash at Nine'' and, with James Nederlander, the ''International Music Stars'' series. She produced concerts in New York and across the United States and Canada by European pop music performers and composers including Enrico Macias, Gilbert Bécaud, Charles Trenet and Domenico Modugno.         Ms. Schwei founded the American Indian Dance Theater in 1987 with Hanay Geiogamah, its artistic director. It was the first all-American Indian professional company of dancers, singers and musicians, with a repertory of traditional pieces that crossed tribal lines and cultures. The company, which has also performed modern work by choreographers including Laura Dean, has appeared twice in the PBS ''Great Performances'' series and was featured on Turner Broadcasting's 1994 documentary series ''The Native Americans.'' It has toured North America, Europe and the Middle and Far East.         The company also released an original cast album for which Ms. Schwei was nominated as producer for a Grammy Award in 1990.         Ms. Schwei is survived by a brother, Peter, of Dodgeville, Wisc.       
         Helen Gee, whose Limelight photography gallery in Greenwich Village in the 1950's became a pioneering blueprint for the offering and selling of photography as an art form, died on Sunday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 85. Her death was announced by a friend, John Erdman.         Spacious and well lit, the Limelight was started in May 1954 and supported by the adjoining coffeehouse. Although a market in fine photographs was almost nonexistent, for about seven years Limelight carried on as if there were one, setting the standard for successors that came in a trickle in the early 1970's and grew into a flood by the 1990's. Ms. Gee mounted new shows at roughly five-week intervals and wrote the news releases.         Two earlier galleries -- Alfred Stieglitz's 291 early in the 20th century and Julien Levy's in the 1930's -- had tried to sell photographs but without success. Limelight did somewhat better. An Atget show, with the prints made by Berenice Abbott and priced at $20 each, was almost a sellout. More than half the pictures in an Edward Weston exhibition, at $75 a print, were bought. But rare photographs, photograms and photomontages by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (priced between $100 and $200) failed to sell. Prints by Robert Frank ($25 each) and Julia Margaret Cameron ($65 each) found only a few buyers. Limelight was the showcase for a wide variety of photographic styles, from classic straight photography (Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham) to social documentary (Brassai, Lisette Model, W. Eugene Smith) and subjective and experimental work (Rudolph Burckhardt, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind). Such a roster differed sharply from the generally homogeneous fare found in popular picture magazines like Life and Look.         Before opening Limelight, Ms. Gee had been a successful retoucher of color transparencies. She briefly took photography courses with Alexey Brodovitch, Model and Sid Grossman. But what Ms. Gee lacked in coffeehouse experience, she made up for in iron determination, familiarity with the Village art and photography worlds, and personal charm.         In her 1997 memoir, ''Limelight: A Greenwich Village Photography Gallery and Coffeehouse in the 50's'' (University of New Mexico Press), Ms. Gee recalled with wry humor and unsentimental directness her struggles with freeloading drug addicts, the lack of adequate help, the threat of bankruptcy as well as brutish union officials.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Mary Cantwell described how Ms. Gee ''had to survive a crooked contractor, a plague of city inspectors, hours in the Bowery's restaurant supply stores and an inundation of Seven Sisters graduates and dropouts all looking to be doing 'something' that would bring them closer to the arts.''         Helen Charlotte Wimmer was born on April 29, 1919, in Jersey City. Her father, Peter Wimmer, had trained in Europe as a church decorator. Settling in New York, he supported his family by painting apartments.         At 16, Helen left home to live in Greenwich Village with Yun Gee, a Chinese modernist painter she had met through an art teacher. They were married in 1942. When Yun Gee, subsequently found to be schizophrenic, threatened to turn violent, Ms. Gee left with their infant daughter, Li-lan.         With a child to support, she taught herself transparency retouching, which paid well. By the early 1950's, with leading magazines and advertising agencies for clients, she could afford a secretary, private school for Li-lan and designer clothes. It was during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art that Ms. Gee came across a photography show and was instantly hooked.         Financial and labor pressures forced Ms. Gee to close the Limelight's doors on Jan. 31, 1961. She then became an art consultant and also started to revive interest in Yun Gee's work. When the photography market began to heat up in the late 1970's, Ms. Gee returned to photography, this time as a curator, lecturer and writer.         In late 2001 and early 2002, Ms. Gee offered her collection of photographs for exhibition and sale, first at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago and then at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in New York. Most of the prints had been given to Ms. Gee by photographers whose work had appeared at Limelight.         Ms. Gee's second marriage, to Kevin Sullivan, ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Li-lan Gee, an artist who lives in Easthampton, L.I., she is survived by a sister, Ellen Berland, of Warren, Conn., and a brother, Henry Wimmer, of Bath, N.Y.

         Sharifa Alkhateeb, an advocate for Muslim culture in the United States who helped place courses in Middle Eastern cultures and Arabic in public schools, died on Oct. 21 at her home in Ashburn, Va. She was 58.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter Nasreen.         Ms. Alkhateeb, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, spent much of her life interpreting Islam. Even as she adhered to Muslim traditions like covering her hair, she encouraged Muslim women to be active in their larger communities.         ''She was dedicated to understanding Islam for herself as opposed to Islam coming to us with all the cultural wrappings,'' said her sister Nafeesa Ahmad.         In 1992, she founded the North American Council for Muslim Women, an education and advocacy group, and was president of the Muslim Education Council, which instructed public-school teachers on Middle Eastern cultures, Islam and Muslim society.         In 2000, she created the Peaceful Families Project, which studies and raises awareness of domestic violence in Muslim communities and is financed by the Department of Justice. At the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, she was chairwoman of the Muslim caucus.         Ms. Alkhateeb wrote and lectured extensively to challenge stereotypes of Muslims, and particularly of Muslim women. She was a co-author of ''The Arab World Notebook,'' a secondary school textbook; for eight years she waged a campaign, which was successful, to make Arabic part of the language offerings in several high schools in Northern Virginia. Publishers of social studies textbooks would seek her comments, and she was an adviser to North American Muslim student groups.         Sharifa Ahmad was born on June 6, 1946, to a Yemeni father and a Czech mother. She finished high school in three years and attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which she received a bachelor's degree in English literature. She later received a master's degree in comparative religion from Norwich University, in Northfield, Vt. From 1978 to 1987 she and her husband lived in Saudi Arabia.         In the 1970's, Ms. Alkhateeb wrote for The Saudi Gazette, an English-language newspaper in Jidda, and she edited an English translation of the Koran. She was managing editor of The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences in the early 1990's.         In 1993, she created a monthly cable television program, ''Middle Eastern Parenting,'' for the Fairfax County (Va.) Public Schools.         After the Sept. 11 attacks, she became a team leader of the Community Resilience Project, a counseling center in Northern Virginia supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.         In addition to her daughter Nasreen Alkhateeb, of Brooklyn, and her sister Nafeesa Ahmad, of Oakland, Calif., Ms. Alkhateeb is survived by her husband, Mejdi; a brother, Muhammad Ahmad, of Horsham, Pa; her sisters Shahara Ahmad-Llewellyn of Manhattan and Sayyida Ahmad Jordan of Los Angeles; her daughters Layla Alkhateeb of Arlington, Va., and Maha Buthayna Alkhateeb of Potomac Falls, Va.; and a grandson.       
         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Dr. M. Irené Ferrer, a New York cardiologist and medical educator who helped refine the cardiac catheter and electrocardiogram, which have become diagnostic essentials in heart treatment, died at her apartment in Manhattan last Friday. She was 89.         The cause was pneumonia combined with congestive heart failure, said a close friend, Dr. Marianne J. Legato, a Columbia cardiologist and internist, who was a protégée of Dr. Ferrer as a medical student in the 1950's.         Dr. Ferrer, who spent four decades at Columbia University, grew up as a New York society debutante, blossoming into an internationally recognized researcher and clinician.         Working at Bellevue Hospital in New York in the 1940's, she contributed to laboratory research that led to the cardiac catheter, a flexible tube passed through a patient's veins and directly into the heart or coronary arteries.         The catheter permits precise measurement of blood pressure and flow and has led to angioplasty and other revolutionary heart treatments. In 1956 its development was recognized with the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, shared by a German scientist, Dr. Werner Forssmann and two researchers from Columbia, André F. Cournand and Dr. Dickinson W. Richards. Dr. Richards noted Dr. Ferrer's studies in his Nobel lecture.         In later work Dr. Ferrer turned to the electrocardiogram, commonly known as an EKG, the electrical record of the heart's beating. She helped devise a computer-assisted algorithm that allowed a clearer and more immediate reading of that record. Previously, the test, which is often used to assess damages after a heart attack, could be interpreted only by doctors with specific training.         Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, chairman of the department of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said that Dr. Ferrer was ''a leader in electrocardiography at a time when it was the only test we had to judge the heart.'' He added, ''She taught today's teachers.''         Marie Irené Ferrer was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan and Bryn Mawr College before earning her medical degree at Columbia in 1941.         She practiced briefly at New York University, then returned to Columbia in 1946 and was named an assistant professor there five years later. Dr. Ferrer was appointed professor of clinical medicine in 1972 and became a professor emeritus in 1981. She continued in private practice until nine years ago.         Dr. Ferrer was a former editor in chief of Current Cardiology and The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. In 1993 she received a gold medal from Columbia Medical School's alumni association.         Dr. Ferrer is survived by a brother, Mel Ferrer, the actor and director, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
         Miriam Schlein, whose nearly one hundred books, written over half a century, taught very young children about animals and concepts like time and space, died on Nov. 23 in New York. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, her family said.         Ms. Schlein wrote to educate while also entertaining her readers. She found new ways of telling them about bats and skunks and porcupines and their behavior even as she cleared up myths about them. Some of her recent books were about dinosaurs, and four are currently in print: ''Before the Dinosaurs'' (1996), illustrated by Michael Rothman; ''The Dino Quiz Book'' (1995), illustrated by Nate Evans; ''Let's Go Dinosaur Tracking!'' (1991), illustrated by Kate Duke; and ''Discovering Dinosaur Babies'' (1991), illustrated by Margaret Colbert.         Other works featured elephants, pandas, sea horses. pigeons and squirrels. Two new books, her last, appeared this year: ''The Story About Me,'' and ''Little Raccoon's Big Question.'' She first appeared in print in 1951 with ''A Day at the Playground'' from Golden Books, where she worked as a secretary.         Ms. Schlein was born in Brooklyn. She received a B.A. in English and psychology from Brooklyn College in 1947 and then held a number of jobs in advertising and publishing.         She was in the children's department of Simon & Schuster when she decided that her future lay in writing. She pursued it with a series of books about concepts, illustrated by Leonard Kessler and published by William R. Scott. They included ''Shapes'' (1952) and ''Heavy Is a Hippopotamus.'' In the 1950's she also wrote some stories about children and animals that won her wide recognition and awards, including ''Four Little Foxes,'' ''Elephant Herd,'' and ''When Will the World Be Mine?'' about a baby snowshoe rabbit, which The New Yorker called ''a poetic book.''         Some of her books were Junior Literary Guild Selections and several of her natural-science titles received Outstanding Science Books for Children awards. ''When Will the World Be Mine?'' (1953), republished 20 years later as ''The Rabbit's World,'' was named a Caldecott Honor Book.         Her marriage to Harvey Weiss of Westport, Conn., an artist who illustrated some of her early work, ended in divorce.         Ms. Schlein is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth S. Weiss of Union City, N.J.; a son, John M. Weiss of Brooklyn; a brother, Dr. Paul Schlein of Bethesda, Md.; and four grandchildren.       
         Gretchen Bender, an artist who worked in several photographic and film mediums, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bender belonged to the generation of early 1980's Pictures artists, who included Jack Goldstein, Cindy Sherman, Robert Longo and Richard Prince. Combining aspects of Conceptual Art and Pop Art, these artists used the images of popular culture to dissect its powerful codes, especially regarding gender and sexuality.         Ms. Bender was born in Seaford, Del., earned a bachelor of fine arts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1973 and moved to New York in 1978. She had her first New York gallery show at the Nature Morte Gallery in the East Village in 1983. Made of black-on-white enamel on squares of tin in cruciform arrangements, Ms. Bender's early work contrasted different categories of images from abstract art, glossy advertising and new photographs. She also appropriated from the mostly male Neo Expressionist painters of her generation and in harsher pieces paired impersonal computerized patterns with grisly images of massacres. Throughout her work she contrasted the immense power of technology and corporations with the plight of individuals.         Ms. Bender did not limit her activities to the art world. The credits she designed for the television show ''America's Most Wanted'' may have originated the rapid-fire hyperediting now pervasive in film, television and video art. She produced, directed and edited music videos for Babes in Toyland and Martha Wash; edited music videos for R.E.M., New Order and Megadeth; and designed sets for the choreographers Bill T. Jones and Molissa Fenley. Her midcareer retrospective, organized by the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse in 1991, toured internationally, as did her multimedia theater pieces ''Total Recall'' (1987) and ''Dumping Core'' (1984).         Ms. Bender's work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Menil Collection in Houston.         Ms. Bender is survived by her partner, Mitchell Wagenberg of Manhattan; her parents, Charles and Carolyn Bender of Charlotte, N. C.; a brother, Jonathan Bender of Los Angeles; and two sisters, Kate Bender of Charlotte and Valerie Godwin of Philadelphia.       
         Maude Lloyd, a dramatically expressive ballerina who became an articulate dance critic, writing in collaboration with her husband, Nigel Gosling, died on Nov. 26 at her home in London. She was 96.         She died after a brief hospitalization, said John Percival, a British freelance dance critic.Born in South Africa in 1908, Ms. Lloyd arrived in London as a dance student and in 1927 became associated with Ballet Rambert, a pioneering British ballet company. After capturing the attention of Antony Tudor, then a young choreographer eager to explore the possibilities of dramatic ballets, she danced in major works of his like ''The Planets'' (1934) and ''Dark Elegies'' (1937).         Perhaps her greatest characterization was that of Caroline in ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (1936), Tudor's poignant and often revived ballet about a young woman who must marry a man she does not love. Ms. Lloyd's eloquence contributed much to the impact of its premiere.         When she started teaching ballet classes for adult beginners, one of her students was a dance-loving young art critic, Mr. Gosling. She married him in 1939 and retired from the stage the next year.         Because Ms. Lloyd's conversation was as expressive as her dancing, and because she and her husband were inseparable, Richard Buckle, editor of Ballet magazine in London, suggested in 1951 that the couple write dance criticism as a team. They adopted Alexander Bland as a byline, derived from the names of two piglets (Pigling Bland and his brother Alexander) in a Beatrix Potter story.         After they wrote for various publications, the team as Alexander Bland began writing dance reviews in 1955 in The Observer, a weekly for which Gosling was also the art critic. Although Gosling stopped writing art criticism in 1975, reviews by Alexander Bland continued until Gosling died in 1982. Some of them are anthologized in ''Observer of the Dance'' (Dance Books, 1985).         When Rudolf Nureyev arrived in England after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1961, the Goslings hospitably took the young dancer under their wings and helped him adjust to his new country. They celebrated his achievements in their book ''The Nureyev Image'' (1976).         Ms. Lloyd is survived by a son, Nicholas, and grandchildren.       
         Frances Chaney, a radio star whose budding film career was stifled after she and her husband, Ring Lardner Jr., were placed on a Hollywood blacklist, died on Nov. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Chaney, who had Alzheimer's disease, died in her sleep, said her son James.         Mr. Lardner was one of the Hollywood 10, jailed in 1950 for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer whether they were Communists. Ms. Chaney was blacklisted because she was correctly assumed to be, as Mr. Lardner's wife, a Communist.         Ms. Chaney found herself unemployed after years appearing on popular radio series like ''Topper,'' ''Gangbusters'' and ''Mr. District Attorney.'' At one point, she spent her mornings playing an ingénue in ''House in the Country'' and her afternoons playing the worldly Burma in ''Terry and the Pirates.''         She had parlayed her radio work into a few screen parts before the blacklist started costing her jobs, but she was able to win parts in Off Broadway and Broadway plays, including understudying for Maureen Stapleton, Kim Stanley and Claudette Colbert.         By the time the blacklist's power faded, Ms. Chaney was entrenched as a stage actress. She worried that she was being typecast as a Jewish mother, a part she played in ''Golda'' on Broadway with Anne Bancroft, in James Lapine's Off Broadway ''Table Settings,'' and in three separate productions of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing.''         Born Fanya Lipetz on July 23, 1915, in Odessa, Ukraine, Ms. Chaney immigrated with her parents to the Bronx when she was a child. After briefly attending Hunter College, she studied on a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.         In the 1960's, she had a recurring role on the soap opera ''The Edge of Night.''         Ms. Chaney's first husband, David Lardner, was a younger brother of Ring Lardner Jr.'s. David Lardner died in 1944. Ring Lardner Jr. died in 2000.         In addition to her son James, of Manhattan, Ms. Chaney is survived by a daughter, Katharine, of Manhattan; another son, Joseph, of Los Angeles; two stepchildren, Peter, of St. Augustine, Fla., and Ann Waswo, of Oxford, England; seven grandchildren; and eight great-granddaughters.       
         Rachael Dunaven Yocom, a dance educator and theorist, died on Nov. 14 in Tucson, said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42nd Street redevelopment organization and a former student. She was 88.         Born in Corvallis, Ore., Dr. Yocom taught dance at schools and universities in Oregon, Idaho and Utah after receiving her doctorate at New York University in 1951. In New York City, she was chairwoman of the dance department from 1954 to 1972 at the High School of Performing Arts, the subject of the movie ''Fame,'' and was teacher in charge of the school from 1973 to 1975.         Dr. Yocom trained generations of New York dancers, among them Jacqulyn Buglisi, Laura Dean, Eliot Feld, Arthur Mitchell, Eleo Pomare, Ben Vereen, Edward Villella, Dudley Williams and Ms. Cahan. She wrote several books on physical education, sports and dance, including ''Modern Dance Techniques and Teaching'' (1946), written with Gertrude Shurr, an early Martha Graham dancer and longtime colleague. Dr. Yocom also wrote songs and was a dance photographer.         Dr. Yokom is survived by two sisters, Ruth Carkin of Tucson and Roberta Jean Fox of Eugene, Ore., and a brother, Raymond, of Lancaster, Pa.       
         Henny Backus, the widow of the comic actor Jim Backus and an actress and author of wit and verve, died on Dec. 9 in Los Angeles, her longtime home. She was 93.         She died after a series of strokes, said a friend, Doris Bacon.         Mrs. Backus, a leggy redhead with a droll sense of humor, started her career as a showgirl in the Broadway revues of the 1920's.         Later she took on character parts in television sitcoms like ''Blondie,'' in which she played the matronly Cora Dithers opposite her husband, who played Dagwood's irascible boss, Mr. Dithers.         Together Henny and Jim Backus wrote several blithe books about their marriage, including ''What Are You Doing After the Orgy?'' (1962), ''Backus Strikes Back'' (1984) and ''Forgive Us Our Digressions'' (1988).         According to one of their books, ''Only When I Laugh'' (1965), it was Mrs. Backus who persuaded Jim to use the upper-crust drawl that eventually landed him the part of the millionaire Thurston Howell III on ''Gilligan's Island.''         ''Any Harvard man I ever went out with sounded like that,'' she explained, ''like he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and they forgot to take it out.''         Henrietta Kaye, who later went by Henriette, was born in Brooklyn on March 21, 1911, and studied art at Cooper Union.         Though her sculptures sold well, she preferred acting and would linger outside stage doors hoping to be hired. She appeared in several musicals and during the Depression she joined an acting troupe sponsored by the federal Works Progress Administration.         She married Mr. Backus in 1943 and became his caretaker 35 years later, after he developed Parkinson's disease. She described what she learned in ''Care for the Caretaker,'' an advice book published in 1999.         She is survived by a sister, Florence Gittleman of Manhattan, and a brother, Irving A. Kaye of Boca Raton, Fla. Her previous marriage, to Nat Karson, ended in divorce.
