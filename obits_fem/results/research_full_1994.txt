         Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Governor of Washington, died yesterday at her home on Fox Island, near Tacoma. She was 79.         She had suffered for some months from a severe bronchial condition, said a friend, Lou Guzzo, who is a television commentator.         Dr. Ray, a marine biologist who championed the nuclear industry, was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the atomic commission in 1972, and served as chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. During her tenure, she raised eyebrows in the nation's capital by living in a mobile home and taking her dogs to the office.         In 1974, she underscored the finding of an Atomic Energy Commission study of nuclear power plant safety: that the chance of mass destruction from a reactor accident was as unlikely as that of a meteor striking an urban area. "There is no question that the nuclear industry comes off very well," she said.         She issued her latest no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues on Thursday, when she dismissed reports about cold-war-era Federal radiation experiments as alarmist.         "Everybody is exposed to radiation," Dr. Ray was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, adding, "A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence." Criticizing Kissinger         The Atomic Energy Commission was eventually abolished and its duties were transferred to the new Energy Research and Development Administration. Dr. Ray was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment and Scientific Affairs.         She resigned from the post later that year, contending that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had ignored her office on policy matters.         It was as a Democrat that Dr. Ray was elected in 1976 to one term as the only female Governor her state has had, becoming the nation's second woman to be elected Governor without succeeding her husband. Ella T. Grasso, a Democrat, had been elected Governor of Connecticut two years before.         Dr. Ray, after her surprise victory, said that she supported the Equal Rights Amendment but that women should "stop brooding about being a woman." She told women, "If you want to do something, then train yourself and you've got to be willing to work."         Governor Ray a conservative in fiscal matters and was praised by a lobbyist in the aircraft industry as "the best friend business ever had."         She also angered environmentalists with her support of nuclear power, unhampered growth and oil supertankers.         But she could also be stern in the environmental sphere. In 1979, she ordered the low-level nuclear waste dump at a Federal reservation in Hanford, Wash., one of only three in the nation, closed temporarily after inspectors had found that some radioactive material was being hauled in unsafe trucks.         In 1980, Dr. Ray herself faced a environmental problem when Mount St. Helens repeatedly erupted, ravaging parts of the state with volcanic mud flows, flooding and ash.         While Dr. Ray was Governor, the power of her intellect and her skill as a speaker gave her an aura of great competence. But she was sharp-tongued, highly unconventional for a politician in high office, and became entangled in disputes with reporters and with other public officials.         Dr. Ray was also burdened by disaffection in her own party going into the 1980 Democratic primary and suffered a startling defeat at the hands of State Senator Jim McDermott, who offered himself as "a Governor who listens."         She was christened Margaret at her birth in 1914 in Tacoma, but she later chose the name Dixy Lee. She climbed Mount Rainier, her state's tallest peak, at age 12 -- becoming the youngest girl to do so -- and went on to graduate in 1937 from Mills College, where she also earned a master's degree. She received a doctorate in zoology from Stanford in 1945.         She taught at schools in Oakland, Calif., from 1938 to 1942 and was an associate professor of zoology at the University of Washington from 1945 to 1976.         With Mr. Guzzo she wrote two books: "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)," published in 1990, and "Environmental Overkill," published this year.         She is survived by her sisters, Marion Reid of Fox Island, Dr. Jean Ray of Long Beach, Calif., Julianna Strong of Salem, Ore., and Elvista Steele of Klatskanie, Ore.       
         Dr. Jeanne Shirley Mintz, an authority on Indonesia and an Asian affairs specialist in the Defense Department, died on Tuesday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital. She was 71 and lived in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her Pentagon office said.         At the time of her death, Dr. Mintz was assistant deputy for Asia, Middle East and Southern Hemisphere affairs in the department's Economic Security Directorate. She had worked at the Pentagon for 20 years and was appointed to her current post in 1986. Spokeswoman for Indonesia         Dr. Mintz was born in Queens and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1943. She earned her master's degree and Ph.D. at Harvard University. Harvard announced that it was establishing a fellowship in her name in its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         During World War II, Dr. Mintz worked in New York as a political and economic analyst for the government-in-exile of the Dutch East Indies. When Indonesia gained its independence, she became spokeswoman for its delegation at the United Nations, serving until 1951.         She also held senior positions at M.I.T.'s Center for International Studies, the Asia Society in New York, the Special Operations Research office in Washington and the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington, Va.         She wrote extensively for professional journals and was the author of several books, including "Indonesia: A Profile" (1961), and "Mohammed, Marx and Marhaen, the Roots of Indonesian Socialism" (1965). She was a past president of Executive Women in Government.         Dr. Mintz is survived by two sisters, Cynthia Puritz of Schenevus, N.Y., and Claire Cutler of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Margaret E. Courain, a retired information manager for the Federal Government and the pharmaceutical industry, died Jan. 13 at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, said Jacqueline Algon, a friend.         Starting in 1949 Dr. Courain spent 32 years at Merck & Company in Rahway, N.J., where she developed research information systems and provided development and education programs for corporate management. From 1981 until her retirement in 1987 she served with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, where she was the deputy assistant administrator of its National Environmental Satellites, Data and Information Service.         She is survived by two brothers, Edward and Gerald, and a sister, Helen Courain, all of Bayonne, N.J.       
         Phyllis Goodhart Gordan, a benefactor and former trustee of the New York Public Library, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Lucy Rastelli, a daughter.         Mrs. Gordan's association with the library dated to 1940, when her husband, John D. Gordan, joined its staff and became curator of its Berg Collection of English and American literature. After his death in 1968 she was appointed to the committee on research libraries and later was its chairwoman. She was a library trustee from 1974 until 1985.         She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Rastelli of Rome, Marjorie Bowden of London and Virginia Gordan of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, John D. Gordan 3d of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Ann M. Sperber, whose biography of Edward R. Murrow was a best-seller in 1986, died on Friday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 58.         The cause was an apparent heart attack, said her brother, Dr. Alan Sperber.         Miss Sperber's book, "Murrow: His Life and Times" (Freundlich Books), was a well-received biography that was republished in paperback in 1987. She had spent over a decade writing the work and had first collected research material for it in Berlin while a Fulbright Scholar there in 1956-57.         Before writing the book about Mr. Murrow, Miss Sperber was an editor of children's books for Putnam and McGraw-Hill. She graduated from Barnard College in 1956.         She is survived by her mother, Lisa Sperber, and her brother, both of Manhattan.       
         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Lillian Weber, a City College of New York professor who was known for her work in early childhood education, died on Tuesday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 77.         The cause was cardiac arrest, reported the City University of New York.         Professor Weber was professor emeritus of education at the time of her death, and her work continues to influence public-school education. She worked with teachers in the New York City schools, helping them to organize the learning process in ways intended to make the classroom more responsive to young pupils as they struggle to make sense of the world.         A grant from the Ford Foundation in 1970 enabled her to develop her approach into an advisory training program. As a result, City College created its Workshop Center two years later with Federal education funds and support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Institute of Education, the Far West Laboratory and, since 1979, the Jesse Smith Noyes Foundation.         She conducted extensive seminars in Europe, Africa and lectured at colleges around the world.         A native of Brooklyn, she graduated form the University of Virginia and earned a master's degree at Bank Street College of Education in 1959. She joined the City College faculty in 1967 after doing research at the University of London. That experience led to her write "The English Infant School and Informal Education" (Prentice-Hall, 1971). She reached emeritus status at City College in 1987.         Professor Weber is survived by two sons, Prof. William Weber of Los Angeles and Prof. John Weber of suburban Chicago; two brothers, John Dropkin of Brooklyn and Henry Dropkin of Sarasota, Fla., and seven grandsons.       
         Dr. Madeline C. Hunter, an educator and psychologist who translated a psychological learning theory into practical teaching techniques, died last Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78 and lived in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles.         Dr. Hunter had a series of strokes, said the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she was an adjunct professor.         Dr. Hunter was nationally known for her work at the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School, the laboratory school of U.C.L.A.'s Graduate School of Education. She served as its principal from 1963 until 1982, when she became a full-time professor in administration and teacher education at the graduate school.         She used her background in psychology to tailor different approaches for helping pupils learn. Her technique identified the most effective methods for teachers in helping pupils overcome any barriers to learning. Her research challenged the view that failure to learn stems from environmental factors like poverty, broken homes or a low I.Q. She believed that proper teaching methods could overcome any disadvantage.         "We have yet to find a student who won't learn," she once said.         She showed the effectiveness of teacher-parent partnerships in education and the importance of helping pupils maintain their self-respect.         A native of Saskatchewan, she grew up in Santa Monica, Calif., and earned four degrees in psychology and education at U.C.L.A. She began a career as a clinical psychologist and then became a school principal. She led schools in different sections of Los Angeles, including Watts and Bel Air, before becoming principal at university elementary.         She wrote 12 books and more than 300 articles on teaching.         Dr. Hunter is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Cheryl,, of Los Angeles; a son, Robin, of Santa Monica; a sister, Dorothy Horner, of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Marija Gimbutas, an author and archeologist, died Wednesday at U.C.L.A. Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 73 and had lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said a colleague, Dr. Cristina Biaggi.         Dr. Gimbutas was the author of 20 books and more than 200 articles on European prehistory and folklore. She was an authority on the prehistoric incursions of Indo-European speaking people into Europe and how they changed society there.         Three of her more noteworthy books are "Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe" (1974), "The Language of the Goddess" (1989) and "The Civilization of the Goddess" (1991). Collectively, they present an interpretation of the Neolithic period of Europe that challenged traditional views of prehistoric societies.         Perhaps her most controversial thesis was that the world was at peace during the Stone Age, when goddesses were worshiped and societies were centered on women. Then, the thesis went, about 6,000 years ago a European culture in which the two sexes lived in harmony was shattered by patriarchal invaders, and the worship of life-giving goddesses was replaced by reverence for war-like gods. Her studies and interdisciplinary approach also created a new field, archeomythology.         Skepticism about her thesis was widespread among scholars, but her ideas were welcomed by many feminists and by Joseph Campbell, the mythologist. Writing about "The Language of the Goddess," Gerda Lerner, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, said that although Dr. Gimbutas's theory could never be proved, it could "challenge, inspire and fascinate" simply by providing an imaginative alternative to male-centered explanations.         She was the main proponent of the theory that languages like English, French, German and Iranian are all related because a warlike people speaking the tongue ancestral to all Indo-European languages conquered Europe and imposed their language on the conquered. A contrary theory holds that early farmers moving out of the Middle East across Europe transmitted a common language along with agricultural techniques.         A native of Vilnius, Lithuania, she received degrees from Vilnius University and a doctorate in archeology in 1946 from Tubingen University in Germany. She immigrated to the United States in 1949, conducted post-graduate research at Harvard University and in 1955 was elected research fellow of the Peabody Musuem at Harvard.         Dr. Gimbutas joined the U.C.L.A. faculty in 1963 and served as professor of European archeology until her retirement four years ago. She directed five major archeological excavations in southeastern Europe.         Dr. Gimbutas is survived by three daughters, Zivile Gimbutas and Rasa Julie Thies, both of Los Angeles, and Danuta Lake of Anacortes, Wash.       
         Dr. Celia Yeack-Scranton, a physical sciences researcher for the International Business Machines Corporation in San Jose, Calif., died on Monday at the Mission Oaks Hospital in Los Gatos, Calif. She was 42.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Robert Scranton.         Dr. Yeack-Scranton, who lived in San Jose, conducted research into magnetic recording technology, in which she held several patents. Earlier this year she was named an I.B.M. Fellow for her work. She held a doctorate in applied physics from Stanford University.         Besides her husband she is survived by a son, Peter, and a daughter, Karen, both of San Jose, and her father, William R. Yeack of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Dr. Gordon G. Wallace, a sociologist and expert on women's reproductive health, died on Thursday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. She was 75.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Patricia Sears, a spokeswoman for Population Action International, a research group in Washington.         Since 1980 Dr. Wallace had been the director of the African women's health project at Population Action International and was an authority on female genital mutilation.         She was also a member of the boards of family planning, environmental and civic organizations. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and in 1942 received a doctorate in sociology from Yale University.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Robert W. Wallace of Washington, and three sons, Randall, of Manhattan, Scott, of Washington, and Bruce, of Tinicum Township, Pa.       
         Judith Schwartz, a designer of commercial and residential interiors in New York, died last Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Schwartz was active in community affairs as a trustee of the Park East Synagogue and a board member of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation. She established a Judith Schwartz scholarship fund at the Rabbi Arthur Schneier Park East Day School and served as a representative of the Women's International Zionist Organization to the United Nations.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated from Finch College, trained at New York School of Interior Design and received a degree in decorative arts at Parsons School of Design. She headed Better Home Furnishing Company from 1965 to 1981, when she established J.R.S. Interiors Inc., her current firm in Manhattan.         Mrs. Schwartz is survived by her husband of 30 years, Stanley; two daughters, Blair and Kim; her mother, Blanche Rosenzweig Levine of Bal Harbour, Fla.; a sister, Carol Nussbaum of Charleston, S.C., and a brother, Lawrence Rosenzweig of Manhattan and Bal Harbour.       
         Dr. Annemarie P. Weil, a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, died on Friday at a convalescent home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         She had had a long illness, said her daughter, Dr. Susan Caroline Weil.         Dr. Weil was in private practice in Manhattan, her daughter said, and at her death was also on the faculty of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Dr. Weil graduated from the institute in 1949 and joined its faculty in 1959. She was a supervising and training analyst there, as well as a teacher.         Dr. Ted E. Becker Sr., a former chairman of the institute's child analysis committee, said that Dr. Weil's "primary interest and research had to do with the neurological and organic aspects of child development."         She was born Annemarie Phiebig in Berlin and earned her Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Basel, Switzerland, in 1934. She and her husband, Dr. Frederic S. Weil, came to the United States from Switzerland in 1940 and settled in Manhattan.         Dr. Weil went on to be a junior psychiatrist on the staff of Bellevue Hospital, a senior psychiatrist at the Child Development Center and a member of the faculty of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. She wrote many papers in her field and received several awards.         Her husband, also a psychoanalyst, died in 1959 after 22 years of marriage.         In addition to her daughter, a hematologist in Wynnewood, Pa., Dr. Weil is survived by two grandsons and a brother, Albert Phiebig of White Plains.       
         Alice Herrington, the founder and longtime president of Friends of Animals, one of the country's best known animal-protection societies, died on Tuesday at DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. Ms. Herrington, a former resident of Manhattan and Little Silver, N.J., was 75 and lived in Lithonia, Ga.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         She founded the nonprofit organization in Manhattan in 1957 and retired as its president at the end of 1986. It now has headquarters in Darien, Conn., and counts 150,000 contributing members nationwide.         When she started Friends of Animals, its purpose was to protect cats and dogs. To that end it offered low-cost spaying and neutering services to cut down the number of strays across the country. The organization eventually built its own clinic for this in Neptune, N.J.         Under her leadership the society widened its activities to preserve animals in general, including wildlife, marine mammals and zoo animals. Ms. Herrington pursued her cause in letters to the editor, advertisements, Op-Ed articles, lectures and public testimony. Panel for Humane Legislation         Her targets included the killing of seals and their pups for fur; leg-hold traps for catching raccoons for their coats; hunters who paid thousands of dollars to shoot polar bears from the air; rodeos in which electric rods, bucking straps and steel spurs are used on broncos and bulls, and cruel uses of animals for experiments, research and testing.         She also started and directed a Committee for Humane Legislation to require that animals be rendered unconscious and insensible to pain before slaughter. That campaign in the 1960's aroused controversy because it was aimed at the shackling and hoisting method used by some kosher slaughterers.         Her disapproval of fur coats led to her arrest for disorderly conduct in 1979, when she took part in a protest outside Gracie Mansion. The occasion was a dinner given by Mayor Edward I. Koch for a group of furriers in town for a convention.         "Hunting is all part of the macho world," she once told an interviewer.  "You bring up your boys and suggest that to be a man like their father they should kill everything that moves, right?"         Ms. Herrington, a Wisconsin native, graduated from the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a daughter, Jennifer C. Schmid of Lawrenceville, Ga., and a sister, Rachel E. Brodeaux of Harlingen, Tex.       
         Sylvia L. Milberg, associate director of development for Pace University in New York, died on Tuesday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. Mrs. Milberg, who lived in Westport, Conn., was 66.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Stanley Milberg.         Mrs. Milberg had been at Pace since 1983. Before that she was director of grants at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. She was a graduate of Antioch College. Also active in civic affairs, Mrs. Milberg was a founder and the first chairwoman of the Westport Historic District Commission.         She is survived by her husband and four sons, Daniel of Northampton, Mass., David of Charleston, Ill., William of New York and John of Seattle.       
         Luba Potamkin, a broadcasting spokeswoman in the 1970's for her family's Cadillac auto dealerships on the East Coast, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 73.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Victor Potamkin.         Three years after her husband founded Potamkin Cadillac in 1972, Mrs. Potamkin and other members of her family appeared in television commercials that featured the line: "If this nameplate isn't on the back of your car, you probably paid too much."         The ebullient commercials, which were also broadcast by Potamkin dealerships on television stations in Pennsylvania and Florida, were noticed. Mr. Potamkin said his forceful merchandising in New York helped his sales.         Mrs. Potamkin, the former Luba Chalken, was born in Philadelphia. She was married to Victor for 52 years and for a large part of that time was content to be a wife and mother to her two sons.  Fighting Against Alzheimer's         She said of her career as a Cadillac spokeswoman on television, which she amplified to include health and fashion tips, that she never studied a script in advance. She told an interviewer in 1977, "To me, it's easy because it's my business and I'm thrilled to say, 'Buy a Cadillac.' "         Her son Alan recalled yesterday that the ad campaign was hatched by his father, who convinced his wife, who was at first reluctant, to do it.         The Potamkin family relinquished the dealership in 1987, selling the assets and leasing the company's Manhattan real estate to General Motors.  For several years the dealership fell into decline under new operators with a more muted television campaign.         Two years ago the Potamkin family resumed operations under the name Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet.         Mrs. Potamkin then became a symbol of the fight against Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed as having in the late 1970's. She and her husband made major donations to research into the disease, and in 1987 the Potamkin family created the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer Research, an annual award of $100,000. They were also active in sponsoring fund-raising events for medical research.         In addition to her husband, who maintains homes in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, she is survived by two sons, Robert, of Philadelphia and Alan, of Miami; a sister, Florence Jans of Miami; a brother, Marvin Chaiken of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Dorothy F. Berezin, a child psychologist who served as a municipal welfare official from 1969 to 1978, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was kidney disease, said her daughter, Judith A. Berezin.         Dr. Berezin served as an assistant commissioner and director of child and adolescent services for the New York City Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services from 1971 to 1978. Previously she had been chief research scientist at that department involved in program planning.         She was a graduate of Smith College and received a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University Teachers College.         She is survived by two daughters, Judith, of Manhattan, and Joan Berezin of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Patricia Miller King, director of the Radcliffe College library devoted to the history of women, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. Dr. King, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., was 56.         The cause was lung cancer, a Radcliffe announcement said.         In 1973 she became director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. In her 21-year tenure the library evolved into one of the nation's foremost centers for women's history. In 1993 the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation donated $2 million to endow the libarary's directorship.         Dr. King was also an officer of the National Council for Research on Women, the American Antiquarian Society and the Massachusetts Historical Society.         She graduated from Radcliffe in 1959 and received a doctorate in medieval history from Harvard University in 1970. As a graduate student she worked at the Women's Archives, a resource center that preceded the Schlesinger Library.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria King of Minneapolis, Ellen Stein-Samel of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Amy Stein of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Mark Stein of Hamilton, Mass.; her mother, Amy Miller, and a brother, Donald Miller, both of New Port Richey, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Mary Anne Devanna, an associate dean at the Columbia University Business School, died on Saturday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was leukemia, said Maryann Hedaa, an associate professor at the business school.         Dr. Devanna earned her Ph.D. in human resources management from the Columbia Business School in 1982. Beginning in 1988, she was named a research professor and an associate dean, becoming one of the highest-ranking women at the school.         Previously, she was director of executive education at the school and, earlier, an advertising executive.         She was co-author of the book "The Transformational Leader: Molding Tomorrow's Corporate Winners," published in 1986. She was also the author or co-author of several other books and wrote numerous articles for journals in the human resource management field.         Dr. Devanna was born in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree from St. John's University in 1960 and a master's degree in business administration from the Columbia Business School in 1974.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a son, Joseph R., of Boston; two daughters, Eva M. Grizell of Boston and Nichole Devanna of Ardsley; two grandchildren, and a sister, Barbara Schwab of Mount Laurel, N.J.       
         Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.         One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.         Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979). Role in War on Poverty         She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.         A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.         Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.         She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .       
         Christy Henrich, a former gymnast of near-Olympic caliber who had eating disorders, died on Tuesday in Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., near her hometown, Independence, Mo. She was 22.         The cause of death was multiple organ system failure, the hospital said. A spokeswoman, Clara Scott, said that "basically, everything shut down." Ms. Henrich had long suffered from two eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia.         After narrowly failing to make the 1988 United States Olympic gymnastics team, Ms. Henrich, a hard-driving competitor who was only 4 feet 10 inches tall, placed fourth in the unequal parallel bars event in the 1989 world championships. Forced to Retire         At that time, she weighed 93 pounds, but then she grew frailer and thinner. Weakness forced her to retire from her sport in 1991, and in mid-1993 she was down to 60 pounds.         Ms. Henrich's death came after a week in the medical center following 10 days in critical condition in a hospital in Independence, Mo.         Anorexia nervosa is an illness of deliberate self-starvation, found chiefly in young women. Bulimia is marked by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced-vomiting. An Intense Athlete         Ms. Henrich, whose father, Paul, was a bowler in past years, was intense about exercise and fitness from an early age. As a teen-ager, she said of competing in the Olympics: "It's what I want to do. I want it so bad."         She attended Fort Osage High School in Independence and turned down college scholarship offers while training in hopes of making the 1992 Olympics. But she did not, and in 1993 she was hospitalized for a time at a Kansas City clinic, also because of her eating problems.         At the time, her mother said: "I would say 99 percent of what has happened to Christy is because of the sport.         Besides her parents, Ms. Henrich's survivors include a brother, Paul.       
         Zelma Watson George, a sociologist, musicologist and performer who broke a color barrier on Broadway in 1950, died on Sunday at University Hospitals in Cleveland. A resident of Cleveland, she was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Raoul Abdul, a New York writer and longtime friend.         Dr. George was a sought-after lecturer, a trained soprano and a leading researcher of African-American music. Her encounter with Broadway was brought about by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti for the 1950 production of "The Medium," a folk opera, at the Arena stage of the Hotel Edison.         Dr. George had sung the opera's leading role of Madame Flora, a fraudulent spiritualist, at the dedication of the Karamu Lyric Theater in Cleveland the year before. 'Power and Imagination'         That production was a black version of the 1946 Menotti work. Learning of her performance, the composer brought her to New York to sing the part in a white production. She was the first black woman to take a white role on Broadway.         "She has great personal force," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. "She sings with power and imagination."         In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her as the only black member of the United States delegation to the 15th General Assembly of the United Nations. In the late 1960's, she was the executive director of the oldest Job Corps center in the United States, in Cleveland. The State Department once sent her on a six-month lecture tour around the world.         Dr. George was born in Hearne, Tex., and graduated from the University of Chicago. She studied voice at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and pipe organ at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. She briefly worked as a social worker in Evanston and spent seven years as a probation officer in Chicago.         From 1932 to 1937, she was the dean of women at Tennessee State University in Nashville. She then helped to organize the Avalon Community Center in Los Angeles and served as its executive director until she was named a Rockefeller Foundation research fellow in 1942. Studying Black Music         Starting early in her career, Dr. George lectured on the cultural contributions of blacks. In 1935 she began her research on black music and started a lecture series on human relations.         She returned to school to earn master's and doctoral degrees in sociology at New York University. Her Rockefeller grant enabled her to travel the country and cull data from libraries, private collections, cellars and attics. She spent six months in the Library of Congress alone.         The result was her doctoral thesis, "A Guide to Negro Music: An annotated bibliography of Negro folk music and art music by Negro composers or based on Negro thematic material." It was a compendium of 12,163 titles; she donated the manuscript to Howard University.         Dr. George sat on policy-making boards of the Girl Scouts of America, the American Red Cross, the League of Women Voters and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, among others.         She was married to Clayborne George, a lawyer in Cleveland and a prominent Republican there. He died many years ago.         Dr. George is survived by two sisters, A. Catherine Johnson of Massachusetts, and Vivian Edwards of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel E. J. Watson of Bangor, Mich.       
         Dorothy Hodgkin, a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1964, died on Friday in her home at Shipston-on-Stour, in Warwickshire in central England. She was 84.         She died after suffering a stroke, her family said.         Professor Hodgkin was the chancellor of Bristol University from 1970 until her retirement in 1988, and also taught at Oxford.         She was the third woman to win the Nobel chemistry award. The first two were Marie Curie, in 1911, and her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie, in 1935.         Professor Hodgkin had used X-rays to probe into the inner architecture of key biochemical compounds, elucidating their structures and providing essential aid for those seeking to understand how and why these compounds work in living organisms.         Over the years, she was the author of a variety of scientific writings on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of structures of molecules, including penicillin, vitamin B12 and insulin.         The Times of London, in looking back over her career, observed on Saturday, "She will always be remembered for her discovery of the structure of penicillin, of the antipernicious anemia factor vitamin B12 and of the diabetic hormone, insulin."         The Swedish Academy of Science, in announcing Professor Hodgkin's prize, praised her "exceptional skill, in which chemical knowledge, intuition, imagination and perseverance have been conspicuous."         In 1965, Queen Elizabeth II made Professor Hodgkin the first woman since Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), the founder of modern nursing, to become a member of the Order of Merit, Britain's most respected royal order. It is limited at any time to 24 members, who have excelled in science, art, letters or the armed services. Years before, in 1947, Professor Hodgkin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for her analysis of penicillin.         In 1960 she became Royal Society Wolfson Research Professor at Oxford, and she retired from that chair in 1977. She held other titles at Oxford in earlier decades, and was a fellow of that university's Somerville College from 1936 to 1977. Among her undergraduate students at Oxford was Margaret Thatcher, who went into politics, not chemistry, to become a long-serving Prime Minister.         In addition, Professor Hodgkin was a member or fellow of numerous learned bodies in Britain, the United States and other countries. And she was a founding member of Pugwash, the international organization of scientists who tried to improve communication between scientists on the Iron Curtain's two sides during the cold war. Pugwash was established in 1957, in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, to study problems linked to the development of weapons of mass destruction.         Professor Hodgkin was born Dorothy Mary Crowfoot in Cairo, where her father worked for the Egyptian Government. She went on to a school in England -- the Sir John Leman School in Beccles, in Suffolk -- and to study chemistry at Oxford and then at Cambridge, in an era when few British women pursued university-level studies in science.         She married Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, an eminent Africanist and Arabist, in 1937; he died in 1982.         Her survivors include two sons and a daughter.       
         Helen F. Cserr, a professor of physiology at Brown University in Providence, R.I., whose research focused on the anatomy and mechanism of the human brain, died on Aug. 11 at her home in North Dighton, Mass. She was 57.         She died of a brain tumor, said her daughter, Ruth, of Princeton, N.J.         Dr. Cserr joined the Brown faculty in 1970 after serving as a researcher at Harvard University, where she received a Ph.D. in physiology. She was also a graduate of Middlebury College in Vermont.         Besides her daughter, Dr. Cserr is survived by her husband, Dr. Robert Cserr of North Dighton; her mother, Ruth FitzGerald of Missoula, Mont.; two sisters, Jean Seglie of Washington and Susan Othmer of Los Angeles, and a brother, Joseph K. FitzGerald of San Francisco.       
         Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on Sunday at her summer home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 78.         Dr. Coser, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of kidney failure, her family said.         She taught at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987, after which she moved to Cambridge. At her death she was an adjunct professor of sociology at Boston College, specializing in the family and medical sociology.         She was born in Berlin and reared in Belgium; she came to the United States in 1939. She started studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research but switched to sociology at Columbia University, where she earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert K. Merton. Taught Sociology at Harvard         Dr. Coser began her teaching career as an instructor at Wellesley College. In 1959 she began teaching at the Harvard University Medical School as an assistant professor of sociology in the department of psychiatry, and later became an associate professor. She also taught at Northeastern University in Boston.         She was the author of "Life in the Ward" (1962) and was involved as a contributor to or editor of "Sociological Studies of Health and Sickness" (1960), "Studies in the Hospital" (1963) and "The Family, Its Structure and Functions" (revised in 1974).         Her recent writing includes "Training in Ambiguity: Learning Through Doing in a Mental Hospital" (1979), "In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy" (1991) and "Laughter Among Colleagues" (1993). All three books remain in print.         Dr. Coser is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Lewis A. Coser, also a sociologist; a daughter, Dr. Ellen C. Perrin of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Steven M. of Melrose, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, for nearly two decades the dean of New York University's School of Social Work, died yesterday at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokeswoman.         Dr. Ehrenkranz, who was credited with enhancing the school's national reputation, joined its staff in 1966 and became its dean in 1977. In her more than 17 years as dean, the school became one of the largest schools of social work in the nation, enrolling more than 1,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs.         Under her leadership, the school also pioneered the holistic approach to clinical social work and became the first institution in the New York metropolitan area to offer a doctorate in clinical social work.         In recognition of her contributions, New York University had announced that the school would be renamed the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work. Jay Oliva, president of the university, said yesterday that there would be a renaming ceremony on Sept. 19. Was a Former Caseworker         Dr. Ehrenkranz received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, master's degrees in English from Temple University, in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr College and in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.         Before joining New York University, she served as a field instructor at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work and a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Social Work. She was also a caseworker and case supervisor in agencies for families and children. She was president of the New York State Association of Deans in 1980-81 and 1988-89.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Kasoff; two daughters, Pamela Ehrenkranz of New York City and Jean LeGrand of Chicago; a sister, Babette Cohen of Rosyln Heights, L.I., and 16 grandchildren.         Correction:  August 27, 1994, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, omitted a survivor. He is her son, Dr. Joel Ehrenkranz of New Vernon, N.J.       
         Christine Lynn Potts, a Russian affairs expert on the staff of the National Security Council at the White House, died on Thursday at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 36.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Miss Potts, who was from Zanesville, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree in political science from Smith College and, in 1982, a master's degree in Russian studies from the University of Michigan. She began her career at the Brookings Institution as a research assistant on Soviet energy and economics.         She then spent two years at the Kennan Institute in Washington and went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1987. She joined the staff of the National Security Council in 1992, specializing in Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs. At the security council she was the principal policy assistant on the economies of the republics of the former Soviet Union.         Miss Potts also served as the executive secretary of a commission established by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia to foster economic and technological cooperation between the two nations. In that capacity, she helped to arrange the panel's first meeting last September.         She is survived by her parents, Robert and Jean Potts of Callawassie Island, S.C.; and two brothers, Mark, of Bozeman, Mont., and Jeff, of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Dr. Margaret Olds Strahl, a retired New York psychiatrist and analyst known for her research on the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, died on Monday at the William Hill Health Care Center in Easton, Md. She was 77.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Dr. Strahl was born in New York City, received her medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine in 1943 and completed her training in psychoanalysis at Columbia University in 1948. She was an associate in psychiatry at Columbia until 1966.         From 1968 to 1991, she worked at the New York Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center, while also keeping a private practice as a psychoanalyst, preparative psychotherapist and diagnostic consultant.         In the 1980's, she also worked for the Veterans Administration, specializing in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders among Vietnam veterans.         She was the author, co-author or editor of several volumes, including "Masked Schizophrenia: Diagnosis and a Unified Method of Treatment" (1980), "Differential Diagnosis in Clinical Psychiatry" (1972) and "The Complete Psychiatrist: The Achievements of Paul H. Hoch, M.D." (1968). An environmentalist, she donated a 400-acre family farm to the Chesapeake Audubon Society for an educational center in Easton.         Her husband, William E., died in 1974.         She is survived by two sons, Eric R., of Prescott, Ariz., and Dr. Stuart D., of Easton, and two granddaughters.       
         Joy Ungerleider-Mayerson, a former director of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her son Andrew Ungerleider.         At her death, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was president of the Dorot Foundation, whose interests include biblical archeology and Jewish education. She was also the chairman of the Albright Institute for archeological research in Jerusalem and served on the boards of other cultural and educational institutions. She was the director of the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street, from 1972 to 1980, after being a curator there from 1967 to 1969.         In 1971, criticized for neglect of its Judaica collection and facing a substantial deficit, the museum's board decided that the institution should devote itself to "a commitment to the Jewish community." The museum was shut during that year, and Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson has been praised as having subsequently rescued it from its doldrums. She shifted the museum's focus from art to Jewish culture, instituting a strong education program and creating popular exhibitions on the subject of Israel and biblical archeology.         As a philanthropist, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was instrumental in providing support, through family foundations, for the New York Public Library. She was the author of one book, "Jewish Folk Art from the Biblical Period to Modern Times" (1986) and the co-author of another, "The Museums of Israel" (Abrams, 1989).         Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson, who was born in Lawrence, L.I., received a B.A. from New York University in 1942 and a master's degree in Hebrew Studies from New York University in 1971. She was married to Samuel Ungerleider in 1945; he died in 1972.         In addition to her sons Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Peter, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. Steven Ungerleider of Eugene, Ore.; three daughters, Jeane Ungerleider-Springer of Boston, Miriam Mayerson-Michael of Manhattan and Clare Benac-Mayerson of Paris; two sisters, Celeste G. Bartos of Manhattan and Miriam G. Wallach of Scarsdale, N.Y., and seven grandchildren       
         Amy Clampitt, known for her dense, ornate and allusive poetry, died on Saturday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 74 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Anne Close, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf.         Ms. Clampitt published her first full-length book of poetry, "The Kingfisher," when she was 63. It was a delayed but auspicious beginning. Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that the author "immediately merits consideration as one of our most distinguished contemporary poets." The work, which challenged readers with long strings of dependent clauses, an often obscure vocabulary and arcane literary allusions, ran counter to the prevailing taste for pared-down, plain speech. Instead, she offered "baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon," the poet Alfred Corn wrote in a review.         Ms. Clampitt was born in New Providence, Iowa, and grew up on a 125-acre farm. After earning a bachelor's degree with honors in English at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1941 she studied at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         She worked as a secretary and a writer at Oxford University Press from 1943 to 1951 and as reference librarian at the National Audubon Society from 1952 to 1959. Through the 1960's and most of the 70's, she was a freelance writer, editor and researcher. From 1977 to 1982 she was an editor at E. P. Dutton. Initially Self-Published         In college, Ms. Clampitt succumbed to the spell of Gerard Manley Hopkins, but she wrote little poetry at the time. In the 1950's, she made unsuccessful stabs at novel writing. It was not until the 60's that she began writing poetry in earnest, initially without success. In 1974, at her own expense, she published a poetry chapbook, "Multitudes, Multitudes." The work caught the eye of Howard Moss, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, who began publishing Ms. Clampitt regularly. In 1981, a second small collection, "The Isthmus," was published.         "The Kingfisher," published in 1983 by Alfred A. Knopf, immediately pushed its author to the front ranks of American poets. Organized around the elements earth, air, fire and water, it treated subjects as various as the plants and marine life of New England, John Lennon's murder, the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.         Comparing Ms. Clampitt to Hopkins, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, critics noted her pinpoint descriptions of the natural world that led to unexpected metaphysical insights and conclusions. She once referred to herself as "a poet of place," a characterization that she later revised to "a poet of displacement." From Life and Myth         "What the Light Was Like" (1985, Knopf) solidified its author's reputation. Like "The Kingfisher," it began with several poems about the New England coast, notably the book's title poem, an elegy for a drowned lobsterman.         In "Archaic Figure" (1987, Knopf), inspired in part by the author's travels in Greece, Ms. Clampitt used Greek myth to explore what Virginia Woolf called "the ancient consciousness of women." Her other major collections were "Westward" (1990, Knopf) and "A Silence Opens" (1994, Knopf).         She also published an essay collection, "Predecessors, et Cetera" (1991, University of Michigan Press) and edited "The Essential Donne" (1988, Ecco Press).         Ms. Clampitt received a fellowship award for distinguished poetic achievement from the Academy of American Poets in 1982 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. She was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         She is survived by her husband, Harold L. Korn; two brothers, Lawrence, of Brunswick, Me., and Philip, of Auburn Hills, Mich., and a sister, Beth, of Carlisle, Iowa.       
         Jerry Allen, an author and former journalist, died on Monday at her home in Norwalk, Conn. She was 83.         The cause was a heart attack, said Marjorie Berke, a friend.         Miss Allen was best known as a biographer of literary figures, particularly Mark Twain and Joseph Conrad. She also edited and wrote introductions for 1966 editions of Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick" and Oscar Wilde's "Picture of Dorian Gray" along with collections of short works by Melville and Conrad. Among her most successful books was "The Thunder and the Sunshine: Biography of Joseph Conrad" (1958).         The Sorbonne honored her in 1967 for her research on Conrad, and L'Academie de Marines in France did so in 1969 for "The Sea Years of Joseph Conrad" (1965). Her "Adventures of Mark Twain" appeared in 1954.         She was a native of Benton, Wis., and worked for The New York Herald Tribune, Reuters and the National Broadcasting Company in New York, London and Paris in the 1930's.         She broadcast from Paris until the German Army was about to enter the city in 1940, when she escaped with fellow journalists. She worked for the Office of War Information and the State Department until 1947, when she became a freelance writer and contributor to magazines and newspapers.       
         Virginia E. Montes, a former national secretary and lobbyist for the National Organization for Women, died Thursday at her home in Atlanta. She was 50.         The cause was a stroke, the Atlanta medical examiner's office said.         Ms. Montes, a native of Honduras, had been active in NOW for 13 years and was the first Latin American woman to serve as a national officer of the organization.         She was elected secretary of NOW and of its national political action committee in 1991 and served until last year. In the spring of 1993 she led the organization's defense of Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was nominated by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. The President withdrew the nomination after conservatives criticized Ms. Guinier for papers she had written on ways for blacks to increase their influence in elections.         Earlier, Ms. Montes was involved in NOW's lobbying efforts while serving as its government liaison officer. In two terms on the organization's national board she headed the committee for racial diversity.         Ms. Montes, who was known as Ginny, came to the United States when she was 10 years old. She was a delegate to three Democratic national conventions and frequently lobbied for civil rights groups in the halls of Southern state legislatures. One cause she advocated was the redrawing of election districts to strengthen minority representation.         In 1980 she became director of legislative research for the Southern Regional Council, based in Georgia. For a time she directed the Georgia Housing Coalition, but later returned to the council, where she was a senior consultant.         She also conducted leadership training activities for NOW, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Women's Political Caucus and other groups.         Ms. Montes is survived by a daughter, Rebecca Albury of Atlanta; her mother, Greta Hyde Montes of Tampa, Fla.; two sisters, Greta Montes of Wayne, Pa., and Jacqueline Zaborski of West Palm Beach, Fla., and three brothers, Robert, of Clearwater, Fla., and Ronald and Hiram, both of Tampa.       
         Joanne Rathgeb, an actress, director and educator who fought for greater awareness and increased resources to fight breast cancer, died of the disease on Nov. 19 at her home in Essex Junction, Vt. She was 64.         Her cancer was diagnosed nine years ago, but she continued an active life. She retired last year as a professor of fine arts and drama at St. Michael's College in Colchester after 30 years on the faculty. She was the first woman to head the fine arts department there.         Vermont has the eighth highest rate of death from breast cancer in the nation, but Mrs. Rathgeb's prominence as a campaigner against the disease extended beyond her home state. She collected about 14,000 letters that were delivered to the Congressional delegation from Vermont. The letters called for increased research and a cancer registry.         In 1992, she started a cancer registry in Vermont, and Congress passed the Cancer Registries Act, which established a national standard for the collection of cancer data.         Mrs. Rathgeb was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and earned a bachelor's degree in theater and a master's degree in English at Indiana State University. She did post-graduate work at Catholic University of America, taught in the Chicago public schools and helped to organize theaters in Terre Haute.         Early in her career, she joined National Players and took part in productions of "The Taming of the Shrew," "Twelfth Night" and "Oedipus Rex" in Europe and in this country, including a performance at the Carnegie Hall Playhouse in Manhattan. She later returned to New York to appear in Phoenix Theater productions of "Peer Gynt" and "Lysistrata."         Since 1958, she had been a producer, director, coach and actress at St. Michael's Playhouse in Vermont.         Mrs. Rathgeb is survived by her husband of 34 years, Donald Sr.; three daughters, Elizabeth Pratt of Amesbury, Mass., and Laura Rathgeb and Mary Jo Balaskas, both of Manhattan; a son, Donald Jr. of Burlington, Vt.; a sister, Laura Mae Hellrung of Alton, Ill.; a brother, Howard Ellspermann of Cape Coral, Fla., and one granddaughter.       
         Dr. Judith Krieger Gardner, a child psychologist, teacher and researcher at Brandeis University, died of an aneurysm on Saturday at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. She was 51 and lived in Belmont and West Tisbury, Mass.         She fell ill three weeks ago on a trek in Nepal with friends, her family said.         Dr. Gardner was an associate research professor at the Heller Graduate School of Advanced Studies and Social Welfare at Brandeis; she was acting director of the school two years ago.         She also taught a course on the history of child rearing at Harvard University and lectured at Boston University.         Born in Philadelphia, she graduated magna cum laude from the Connecticut College for Women in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard in 1971.         Dr. Gardner was a former research associate at Children's Hospital in Boston and a staff psychologist at the Judge Baker Center in Boston.         She was co-editor with Howard Gardner, her former husband, of many books, including the multivolume series "Classics in Psychology" and "Classics in Child Psychology" published by Ayer.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her daughter, Kerith, of Manhattan; two sons, Jay and Andrew of Belmont, and her parents, Sylvia and Bernard Krieger of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.

         Janet Oppenheim, a historian on aspects of 19th-century British life like psychological depression, the condition of women and sex roles and stereotypes, died on Friday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 46 and lived in Villanova, Pa.         The cause was cancer, said her mother, Elaine Oppenheim.         At her death, Dr. Oppenheim was a professor of history at American University in Washington, where she had taught since 1975.         Her latest book is "Shattered Nerves: Doctors, Patients and Depression in Victorian England" (Oxford, 1991). Praising the work in The New Republic, the author Alfred Kazin wrote, "The scholarship is remarkably full, meticulous and far-reaching." And the Stanford University historian Peter Stansky called it "a fascinating study" that "tells us much about the age itself, its preoccupations and obsessions."         In a 1987 interview, Professor Oppenheim said some feminist historians had suggested that Victorian women had been especially prone to mental and emotional illness because of the confining nature of their lives. But, she said, "for every woman who collapsed in such an illness, there were scores, maybe even hundreds, who soldiered on against the same restrictions and the same limitations on their lives."         Among Professor Oppenheim's other books was "The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914" (Cambridge, 1985), which the journal Victorian Studies called "a major contribution to the history of ideas."         Courses that Professor Oppenheim taught at American University included "Men and Women in Victorian Culture: Gender Roles and Stereotypes" and "Selected Topics on the Condition of Women in Victorian England." She was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1979 and Bryn Mawr College in 1986, and a Guggenheim Fellow in 1988.         Professor Oppenheim was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Brearley School there and, in 1970, from Bryn Mawr College, where she was summa cum laude. She received a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University in 1975.         In addition to her mother, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, John Salmon, a retired Bryn Mawr history professor; a daughter by a previous marriage, Ashley Minihan of Villanova, and a sister, Barbara Berresford of Manhattan.
