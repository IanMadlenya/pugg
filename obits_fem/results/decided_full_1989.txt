        Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         It was generally acknowledged that Miss Milanov was the greatest dramatic soprano after Rosa Ponselle, who retired early in 1937. On Dec. 17, 1937, the young Yugoslav soprano made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Leonora in Verdi's ''Trovatore.'' It was not one of the more fabulous debuts in the Met's history, and critics hedged about the new singer.         But when Miss Milanov settled down after a few performances and demonstrated what she could do, it became clear that the great Ponselle had a worthy successor. In her first season at the Metropolitan Opera, Olin Downes, then the chief music critic of The New York Times, constantly referred to her ''magnificent'' voice and her ''grand manner.'' Virgil Thomson in The New York Herald Tribune wrote that she had a voice ''with a beauty unmatched among the sopranos of this country.''         Everything about Miss Milanov commanded respect, and that included her physical and vocal size.         When Edward Johnson, then general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard her in 1937 at the Salzburg Festival, where she was singing under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, he immediately recognized her potential and offered her a contract that had two stipulations: She had to learn her roles in Italian (up to then she had been singing Italian operas in her native Croatian or in German), and she had to take off 25 pounds. English, After a Fashion         She not only learned to sing in impeccable Italian, but she also learned English, after a fashion. For many years she would order a ''martinelli'' instead of a martini, an allusion to the musical associations with the tenor Giovanni Martinelli.         She was always struggling with her weight and often tried to diet. But she liked to eat, and was herself a good cook, specializing in Yugoslav dishes. Once she took off considerable weight and a critic wrote that the dieting had also brought with it ''a disturbing lessening of her powers.''         Miss Milanov shrugged off the comment. ''You try to do your best to please the public, please critics, please everybody,'' she said. ''Then you lose weight and they don't like you. What you do? You get bugs in the head.'' A Formidable Ego         Miss Milanov was a legend around the Metropolitan Opera in more ways than one. Her ego was commensurate with her stature as a vocalist.         ''I love applause,'' she once said to an interviewer. ''Money is not everything. Money is last.'' Rash was the singer who would try to upstage Miss Milanov at curtain calls.         Stories about her circulated in the house almost from the moment she first set foot on stage. Once, during a stage rehearsal, she looked into the auditorium and saw the team of backup singers for ''Il Trovatore.'' She advanced to the footlights. ''Listen, listen, listen - learn, learn, learn,'' she told the young singers. In a Mischievous Mood         It is said that she could drive her colleagues crazy during performances when she was in a mischievous mood. George London, as Amonasro in ''Aida,'' would be preparing for his big baritone solo. Miss Milanov at that moment would whisper in his ear, ''How's the baby, George?'' Or, in the ''Aida'' Nile scene with a tenor she did not particularly like: ''You're not in good voice tonight, are you? Do you think you can make that high B?''         She could be inconsistent in her singing. It was noticed time and again that Miss Milanov could sing like an angel in one act and have pitch troubles in another.         But there was never a time in any opera when she did not thrill her audiences, and she did so entirely through her voice, because she never was much of an actress. Definitely of the old operatic school of acting, she used the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions that went out in the early days of silent films. But she was a fine musician and never used her voice in an exaggerated manner.         Her singing was refined, subtle, powerful, sensitive or dramatic, as the music demanded. She produced a big, warm sound and had an equalized scale up to a secure high C. In the ''Aida'' Nile scene she was able to take a haunting pianissimo on the C that will forever float in memory. She was equally impressive in ''Il Trovatore,'' an opera that she ''owned.'' Fortunately, she recorded that opera with Jussi Bjoerling and Leonard Warren, and connoisseurs believe it is the greatest performance of that work ever put on disks. Born to a Musical Family         She was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 17, 1906, the daughter of a bandmaster named Rudolf Kunc. The family was musical, and her brother, Bozidar, became a pianist and composer who often was her accompanist for her recitals. She also had an uncle who composed songs for her early recitals. She started singing as a child and made her recital debut in Zagreb when she was 15 years old.         Milka Ternina, a great Wagnerian soprano at the turn of the century, heard the young soprano and took her as a pupil for three years. After graduating from the Royal Music Academy in Zagreb, where she won first prize in singing, Miss Kunc became a member of the State Opera, making her debut as Leonora in ''Il Trovatore.''         Soon she was singing in opera houses in Germany and Central Europe, and appearing with orchestras under conductors like Bruno Walter. Toscanini invited her to Salzburg in 1937 to sing the soprano solo in the Verdi Requiem. She was to sing it with him many times in the future.         She married a Yugoslav actor and director, Predrag Milanov, in 1937. He served as her dramatic coach for many years. Gave 445 Met Performances         At the Metropolitan Opera she specialized in Verdi roles, above all ''Aida,'' which she sang at the house and on tour with the Met 75 times. She also appeared in ''Il Trovatore'' 49 times, ''La Forza del Destino'' 37 times, ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' 30 times, ''Otello'' 17 times, ''Simon Boccanegra'' 10 times and ''Ernani'' 8 times. Her other roles were Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' which she sang 57 times, Ponchielli's Gioconda, Puccini's Tosca, Bellini's Norma (a role ventured by only three sopranos at the Met in the 60 years before Miss Milanov sang it), Mozart's Donna Anna and Maddalena in Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' the role she sang at her farewell. All told, she gave 445 performances with the company.         Miss Milanov became an American citizen in 1946. ''When you come to America,'' she said, ''you get independent like American women.'' At that time, she was getting a divorce from Mr. Milanov. In 1947, she married Gen. Ljubo Ilic of Yugoslavia. Though trained as an architect, he had served as a general with the Resistance in southern France.         At the time of his marriage, General Ilic, a close friend of Marshal Tito, was a diplomat. Miss Milanov left the Met from 1947 to 1951, returning to Yugoslavia with her husband. Accused of Being a Spy         In 1949 she was accused by the Soviet Union of being a United States spy. She said the charge was ''silly.'' Her manager, Jack Adams, laughed at the allegation. He said that Miss Milanov could never have been a spy because she could never keep a secret, and that she was interested only in music, clothes, good food and wine.         She was honored on her 25th anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera with an on-stage ceremony, with Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, as master of ceremonies. She decided to retire at the end of the 1965-66 season, just before the opening of the new opera house in Lincoln Center. ''It is better,'' she said, ''to go away on two legs rather than on one.''         In her last operatic performance, on April 14, 1966, she sang the role of Maddalena in ''Andrea Chenier.'' In a ceremony on stage after the third act, Mr. Bing presented her with a Steuben glass cup and Lowell Wadmond, the chairman of the Met's board, gave her a silver tray. Two days later, Miss Milanov made her final appearance in the house. During the festivities on April 16, the final day at the old Met, she sang a ''Chenier'' duet with Richard Tucker.         In her years of retirement, Miss Milanov kept up a lively interest in the affairs of the Metropolitan and devoted much of her time to coaching younger singers (among them Christa Ludwig, Regine Crespin and Anna Moffo). She divided each year between Manhattan and Yugoslavia. Her recent birthday was celebrated with a party for 20 close friends and relatives in her home, for which the soprano, as was her custom, did all the cooking.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         The San Clemente General Hospital issued a statement saying Miss Jorgensen's death followed a long bout with bladder and lung cancer.         Miss Jorgensen was born in the Westchester section of the Bronx on May 20, 1926, and was named George Jorgensen Jr. In her book, ''Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Biography,'' published in 1967, Miss Jorgensen said she had a normal, happy childhood but on growing up became frustrated by feelings that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. A Sensation in Tabloids         As George Jorgensen, she served as a clerk in the Army. After being honorably discharged, she decided to seek a sex change operation.         Her sexual conversion began with hormone injections in 1950, when she was 24 years old. It was completed in 1952 with surgery at the Danish State Hospital in Copenhagen under the care of Dr. Christian Hamburger, a Danish hormone expert whose first name she took to form her own.         On her return to the United States in 1955, her transsexualism was sensationalized in the daily tabloids, some of which she gave exclusive interviews.         One tabloid headline read, ''Bronx GI Becomes a Woman!'' and went on, ''Dear Mum and Dad, Son Wrote, I Have Now Become Your Daughter.''         The New York Times carried a five-paragraph Associated Press story headlined, ''Bronx 'Boy' Is Now A Girl.''         ''At first I was very self-conscious and very awkward,'' Miss Jorgensen said in an interview in 1970. ''But once the notoriety hit, it did not take me long to adjust.''         Miss Jorgensen was the first transsexual in the United States to publicly announce her change of sexual identity. Rather than withdraw from public attention, she turned the notoriety to her advantage with a series of lucrative tours on the lecture and nightclub circuit. Her nightclub act featured the theme song, ''I Enjoy Being a Girl.''         ''I decided if they wanted to see me, they would have to pay for it,'' she said. Chose Not to Marry         She made headlines again in 1959 when she sought, but was denied, a license to marry because her birth certificate said she was a male. She later chose not to marry. She could not have had children.         In an interview last year, she said she never regretted her decision to change sexes. She linked the public reaction to her decision, in part, to the awakening that led to the sexual revolution of the 1950's and 1960's.         But as a person who had experienced both sides of the issue, she said in an interview in 1972 that she did not understand the women's liberation movement.         Discussing the subject with a group of students at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, Miss Jorgensen said: ''I don't know very many women who arent't liberated. Men need liberation too.''         For the last 20 years, she lived in California, the last two in San Clemente.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy, and two nieces.       
        Mary Regina Hayford, the ''Little Old Lady from Dubuque'' who helped turn a New York snub into a symbol of pride, died Monday. She was 85 years old.         Mary Regina Hayford, the ''Little Old Lady from Dubuque'' who helped turn a New York snub into a symbol of pride, died Monday. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Hayford worked for 25 years to take advantage of a barb from Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker magazine, against Midwestern provincialism. In his prospectus for the magazine in 1925, Mr. Ross declared that the publication was not edited ''for the little old lady from Dubuque.''         Mrs. Hayford began her effort in 1964, at age 60, as part of a Dubuque Chamber of Commerce campaign to fight the city's image. The campaign's organizers decided to use the ''Little Old Lady'' character to counteract Mr. Ross's put-down.         ''She took it very seriously,'' said Auleen Eberhardt, a longtime friend of Mrs. Hayford. ''She would try her best to give Dubuque publicity as a wonderful town.''         As Dubuque's representative, Mrs. Hayford was presented with a sequined gown at Sak's Fifth Avenue in New York. She appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' and traveled the country. She spoke of the city's three colleges, its varied industries and its location in a scenic area on the Mississippi River.         Mrs. Hayford is survived by two daughters, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.         A funeral is scheduled for Wednesday in Dubuque.       
        Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         The Post's vice president for editorial and administration, Peter Faris, said she had died of cancer. Members of the Post staff said Mrs. Schiff had learned in May that she had cancer and had decided against being treated for it.         Mrs. Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker, used her family money to obtain the controlling stock of The Post in 1939. She sold it in 1976 to Rupert Murdoch, who sold it in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow.         Under her stewardship, the newspaper alternately made and lost money, and Mrs. Schiff constantly fretted that it would drive her into pauperdom. But she always managed to keep the newspaper afloat, seeing it outlast its competitors to become the only afternoon daily in New York City. She said in 1987 that she decided to sell the paper to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur, after The Post incurred heavy losses in the mid-1970's. Weak Competitor in '39         Mrs. Schiff bought a controlling interest in The Post in 1939 from J. David Stern at the urging of her second husband, George Backer. She had little business experience, and she later learned that she had assumed obligations for millions of dollars in severance pay if the paper closed.         Mrs. Schiff played only a peripheral role in the management of The Post in the first 10 years of her ownership. When she took active control, her new editor, James A. Wechsler, said the odds of its surviving were 1,000 to 1. Few would have challenged him. The Post was a weak third in the field of New York City afternoon dailies, behind The Journal-American and The World-Telegram, and it had been losing money for 20 years.         But the Post survived and prospered, becoming a liberal power in journalism while its powerful competitors collapsed, one by one. Even her critics agreed that most of the credit had to go to Mrs. Schiff. But they also said her success was partly attributable to personality traits for which they criticized her and to which she freely confessed: a fondness for gossip and scandal, a fear of becoming poor and a craving for power or, as she called it, influence. 'Men, Money & Magic'         Mrs. Schiff resumed her maiden name after her third divorce but decided that ''Mrs.'' was more appropriate than ''Miss'' for a grandmother. She described her private life in her diaries and other papers and in interviews. The book, ''Men, Money & Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,'' by Jeffrey Potter, was published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan in 1976.         Much of the book is devoted to her relationships with her husbands and male friends, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who persuaded her to build a home near his in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her biography suggested that their relationship had included sex and that it had been approved by Mr. Backer.         Mrs. Schiff came to regret what she called ''that awful book.'' In a statement volunteered for this obituary, she said, ''I want to make it very clear that President Roosevelt never made a suggestion that I become his girlfriend, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was just as good a friend as Mr. Roosevelt.'' Born on Fifth Avenue         Mrs. Schiff was born on March 11, 1903, in the Fifth Avenue apartment of her parents, Mortimer L. and Adele Neustadt Schiff. The apartment was a wedding gift from her grandfather, Jacob H. Schiff, a stern banker and the head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company.         As a girl, Dorothy - known to many as Dolly - was often treated coldly by her parents, each of whom had separate romantic and social interests. ''There was no joy in my growing up,'' she recalled. ''None, absolutely none.''         Later she would explain her refusal to grant bonuses or congratulations to Post staff members for good work by saying, ''They weren't given to me as a child, and any words I did receive were not ones of praise.''         She was, by her account, a bookish and sullen girl, associating solely with other young socialites at the Brearley School, Class of '20, on the Upper East Side. After her freshman year at Bryn Mawr College, where, she said, ''I flunked every single course, which is pretty hard to do,'' she set her heart on Richard B. W. Hall, a handsome socialite, though lacking in great wealth. Her parents opposed the match and, in classic fashion, sent her to Europe. But they finally yielded, in 1923. 'Rich at Last!'         Two children, Mortimer and Adele, were born in the first two years, but the marriage quickly turned cold.         After Mrs. Schiff's parents died in 1931, she said, she told her husband: ''My God, I'm rich at last! . . . And now I'm going to leave you.''         Mrs. Schiff said Mr. Hall had resented her Jewish origins as a social handicap. Shedding him, she abandoned a formal conversion to the Episcopal Church and gradually reverted to an old family concern for the fate of European Jewry.         She married Mr. Backer in 1932, because, Mrs. Schiff said, ''In those days, I thought it was important to be married, and since the substantial older ones had enough sense not to marry me, there wasn't much choice.'' Glamour and Politics         Until then, she had been, by her account, a socialite and a nominal Republican, interested chiefly in the glamour of the international set. He was a writer and a liberal Democrat, and he introduced her to the Algonquin Round Table and New Deal politics.         She joined the Roosevelt campaign in 1936 in a minor role and became active in welfare work. Three years later she gained control of The Post, ''with the understanding that I would pay the debts and the deficits,'' she said in 1987.         Mr. Backer became the nominal publisher and editor, and his wife was vice president and treasurer. She lost nearly $2 million the first two years as costs rose and circulation fell, to 190,000 from 250,000. Mrs. Schiff became terrified that the paper would bankrupt her.         She decided it needed a popular approach - a tabloid form, more comics and columns, and plenty of glamour, scandal and human-interest articles.         The features editor, Ted Thackrey, agreed. Mr. Backer did not. Marrying the Editor         Mrs. Schiff took over as publisher in 1942, separated from Mr. Backer and named Mr. Thackrey editor.         The publisher married the editor the next year, and while she was involved in buying radio and television stations, which were eventually sold, The Post under Mr. Thackrey was building circulation and cutting its losses.         The couple diverged on politics, and they publicized their disagreements in a series of columns during the 1948 Presidential campaign, he supporting the Progressive Party candidate, Henry A. Wallace, and she the Republican, Thomas E. Dewey. Both disliked Harry S. Truman, who won.         The Thackreys were divorced the next year. The Golden Age         To many readers and former Post staff writers, the era of James Wechsler's editorship, 1948 to 1961, was the newspaper's golden age. Talented reporters and columnists were hired, and although many features were about sex and celebrities, the paper also took on targets previously immune to critical coverage, like J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and Robert Moses.         From 1950 on, The Post was a money maker almost without interruption. But Mrs. Schiff never lost her sense of financial insecurity. She kept a tight rein on costs, gradually eliminating foreign and out-of-town coverage and permitting many skilled employees to leave for jobs that paid better.         She also kept a close watch on policy, conferring daily with department chiefs. Her decision in 1961 to name Paul Sann editor, making Mr. Wechsler the editorial page chief and a columnist, was generally perceived as favoring human interest over crusading.         As a publisher, she joined the strike-lockout that closed the daily newspapers in New York for 114 days beginning in December 1962. One month before the labor stoppage ended, she resumed publication because, she said, she had been snubbed in the negotiations by her male fellow publishers and because she feared that the continued stoppage might cause the death of weaker papers like The Post. Competition Dwindles         In fact, by 1966 The Daily Mirror had folded, and the morning New York Herald Tribune had merged with the big evening papers into The World Journal Tribune, familiarly dubbed The Widget.         ''I was petrified,'' Mrs. Schiff recalled. ''Here we had Jock Whitney, William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Jack Howard teaming up in the evening field.''         But an executive of the former Herald Tribune, Walter N. Thayer, reassured her, saying, ''It's an impossible three-headed thing.'' He was right. The paper closed a little more than a year later.         Mrs. Schiff then had the evening field to herself. She moved The Post from West Street to The Journal-American plant on South Street. She installed automated equipment and a spacious sixth-floor oval office for herself. The Sale to Murdoch         In December 1976, Mrs. Schiff startled the public and her staff by announcing the sale of The Post to Mr. Murdoch for $31 million. She did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed that she was pessimistic about the future of afternoon papers in the city.         ''The reason has been widely misconstrued,'' she said later in an interview. ''It was not sold for 'estate purposes.' Evening papers in urban areas have not survived. The Post had a deficit in 1975 and was a heavy loser in 1976, and I could no longer meet the deficits.''         In an interview last year, Mrs. Schiff said of her long ownership of the Post, ''It was a terrible headache.'' She said that she was then, in 1988, spending her time on needlepoint and other less stressful activities.         Mrs. Schiff married Rudolf Sonneborn, a Baltimore industrialist, in 1953. They separated in 1965 and were later divorced.         Surviving are the children of the first marriage, Mortimer W. Hall of Millbrook, N.Y., and Adele Hall Sweet, of Manhattan; a daughter from the second marriage, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, also of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
        Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Bette Davis, who won two Academy Awards and cut a swath through Hollywood trailing cigarette smoke and delivering drop-dead barbs, died of breast cancer Friday night at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. She was 81 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.         Miss Davis was en route to her home from the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain, where she had been honored for her acting career. She arrived in Paris on Tuesday and was to fly to Los Angeles, but was taken instead to the hospital, on the outskirts of Paris.         Her lawyer, Harold Schiff, said she had undergone a mastectomy in 1983.         ''The doctors had told us the cancer had spread, that it was terminal,'' he said. ''The doctors had said let her go on going about her business.'' #2 Oscars, 10 Nominations For more than a half century, Bette Davis reigned as a Hollywood star in the grandest meaning of the term. With her huge and expressive eyes, her flamboyant mannerisms and her distinctive speaking style, she left an indelible mark on her audiences in a wide variety of roles.         Nominated for 10 Oscars, Miss Davis was a perfectionist whose tempestuous battles for good scripts and the best production craftsmen for her films wreaked havoc in Hollywood executive suites.         ''I was a legendary terror,'' she once recalled. ''I was insufferably rude and ill-mannered in the cultivation of my career. I had no time for pleasantries. I said what was on my mind, and it wasn't always printable. I have been uncompromising, peppery, intractable, monomaniacal, tactless, volatile, and ofttimes disagreeable. I suppose I'm larger than life.''         She was indeed. Few in the entertainment industry could deny that Bette Davis possessed all the legendary indestructibility of the New England Yankee that she was. Starting as a stage actress, she won spectacular fame as a screen star and, as she grew old, shifted effortlessly to high-paying television roles.         Miss Davis's two Oscars for best performance by an actress were won in 1935, for ''Dangerous,'' and in 1938, for ''Jezebel.'' But perhaps she is best recalled for her tour de force as Margo Channing, the tough-talking but soft-hearted stage actress in ''All About Eve,'' for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.         She made almost 100 films. Her 10 nominations for Oscars are the most any actress has received. And she received many other honors, including the Life Achievement Award of the American Film Institute and the Cesar Award of the French film industry. In 1987 she received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievements in the performing arts.         The Kennedy Honors coincided with the release of ''The Whales of August,'' a film in which Miss Davis co-starred with Lillian Gish and for which she won wide critical praise. She appeared in that movie and in television and film roles despite having had a mastectomy and a series of strokes while hospitalized in 1983. ''It was my terror that I'd never work again,'' she said afterwards, ''for I have always very much loved to work.''         Last April 24, Miss Davis was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at its annual tribute, joining the company of such previous honorees as Sir Laurence Olivier and Charlie Chaplin. ''An honor I'm delighted to get,'' she said at the time. ''Greedy, greedy. Can't have too many awards. I've gotten just about every award there is.''  Enduring Popularity  'Acting Should Be Larger Than Life'         Although Miss Davis reached the apex of her popularity in films between the mid-1930's and the early 50's, her appeal swept across generations, due largely to her frequent appearances in made-for-television films and the repeated showings of her old, now-classic movies on television.         These classics include ''Of Human Bondage,'' ''Dark Victory,'' ''The Corn Is Green,'' ''The Letter,'' ''The Great Lie,'' ''A Stolen Life,'' ''Now, Voyager,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Petrified Forest'' and ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?''         New generations of entertainers, many of them female impersonators, have found her distinct mannerisms and clipped speech irresistible material for their acts.         ''Oh Petah, Petah, Petah,'' such an impersonator will say, rolling exaggeratedly widened eyes and puffing savagely on a cigarette. ''What a dump!'' And, inevitably, the memorable line that Margo Channing utters as she walks drunkenly up the stairs at her party: ''Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night.''         ''You know, I've learned from the imitators,'' Miss Davis said in an interview this year. ''I really have. I was never conscious I moved my elbow like that'' - she moved it from side to side - ''until I saw someone doing me.''         She was always proud of her approach to acting. ''Natural!'' she said. ''That isn't the point of acting. The public must believe us. They must also be somehow ennobled. Did I ever try to be low-key? Never, never, never! I fought that from the beginning. I think that acting should be larger than life.''  At First, Simply 'Betty'  A Broken Home And School Away         Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Mass., on April 5, 1908, Miss Davis came from a firmly rooted Yankee background. Her mother was the former Ruth Favor; her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, a Harvard Law School graduate who became a Government patent attorney.         Her father divorced her mother when Miss Davis was 7 and her sister, Barbara, was 5, leaving her mother to rear the children alone. In later years Miss Davis said many times that she saw the divorce as her father's abandonment of his family, and that it left her barren of love for him and preternaturally devoted to her doting mother.         Mrs. Davis put the girls in boarding school in Massachusetts and moved to New York. In 1917, she was joined by her daughters.         It was at about that time that ''Betty'' Davis took the more exotic-sounding name that would become world-famed. A friend of her mother's who was reading Balzac's ''La Cousine Bette'' suggested the name-spelling change, telling her that it would ''set you apart, my dear.''         In her teens, Miss Davis returned to New England, living in several towns there while her mother worked as a portrait photographer. She waited on tables at her schools, and once, to help with family expenses, posed nude for a woman making a sculpture.         Miss Davis decided in her teens that she wanted to become an actress, and her mother took her to New York in 1928, where she arranged for her to read for Eva Le Gallienne, whose Civic Repertory Theater was then one of the most popular touring companies.         ''Miss Le Gallienne thought I was not serious enough in my approach to warrant my attendance at her school,'' Miss Davis recalled years later.  Breaking Into the Business  Stage Experience, Looks and a Voice         Miss Davis's first professional acting job was with a winter stock company in Rochester, run by the director George Cukor, who dismissed her after a few months. She made her New York acting debut in 1929, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village, in Virgil Geddes's ''The Earth Between.'' Brooks Atkinson, critic for The New York Times, wrote that she was ''an entrancing creature.''         Successes and disappointments were to come in rapid order after that. The young actress, then only 21 years old, was in her first Broadway hit, ''Broken Dishes,'' quickly followed by ''Solid South,'' in which she played the beguilingly named Alabama Follensby, the first of many Southern-belle roles that were to come her way.         The movies had learned to talk only a few years earlier, and Hollywood was greedily spiriting away Broadway actors and actresses who had good speaking voices as well as looks. It was thus perhaps inevitable that a fresh young actress with some training and experience and a couple of good notices would be asked to take a screen test.         She was given a $300-a-week contract by Universal Pictures, and Miss Davis and her mother went to Los Angeles in 1930. Her first movie role was in ''Bad Sister,'' notable only for the fact that it also introduced Humphrey Bogart to films. But the movie's cinematographer, Karl Freund, passed the word to studio bosses that ''Davis has lovely eyes,'' and just as she was to be dropped, her option was picked up for another 13 weeks.         By the end of 1932, Miss Davis, discouraged after having appeared in six lackluster movies and finally without a contract, prepared to return with her mother to New York. Then she got a call from George Arliss, the highly respected English actor, who was to be her mentor until his death.         He hired Miss Davis as his leading lady in ''The Man Who Played God,'' her breakthrough movie role.         The film was a success, and its producer, Warner Brothers, signed Miss Davis to her first contract. It was the start of a love-hate relationship with the studio that was characterized by Miss Davis's frequent storming off sets, being suspended for refusing to act in what she considered inferior movies, and going to court to sever her ties with Warners.         But in her first three years at Warners Miss Davis made 14 films, including Edna Ferber's ''So Big,'' with Barbara Stanwyck starring, and ''20,000 Years in Sing Sing,'' which was, she was to say, ''my only film with the great Spencer Tracy, to my everlasting regret.''         ''He was the finest actor I ever worked with,'' she said.  Getting Parts, and Noticed  Unafraid to Play The Villainess         She was working hard, in mostly forgettable fare, but Miss Davis was also learning the movie craft and earning the respect of technicians.         From the start Miss Davis, unlike leading ladies of the day, had no qualms about playing unsympathetic roles, and so was overjoyed in 1934 when she was lent by Warners to the rival RKO studios to play the cruel and slatternly waitress Mildred in W. Somerset Maughham's ''Of Human Bondage,'' opposite Leslie Howard as the crippled hero Philip.         ''Every actor who becomes a star is usually remembered for one or two roles,'' she said, ''like Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz', Garbo in 'Camille,' Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire.' Mildred in 'Of Human Bondage' was such a role for me. She was the first leading-lady villainess ever played on a screen for real.''         ''It's odd that people remember me best for my evil roles,'' she said, ''since I played so many other kinds of characters. But villains always have the best-written parts.''         She was widely praised for her performance as Mildred and nominated for an Academy Award, but she failed to win one, mostly, she said, because Warner Brothers did not want to promote an Oscar for a film it did not produce. She came to regard the Oscar that she won the next year, for ''Dangerous,'' as ''a consolation prize.''         She was always proud of her two Oscars, though, and said this year: ''I'm not a bit modest about them. I don't use those boys for door stops.''         Warners was treating her with new respect, giving her movies like ''The Petrified Forest,'' with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, but Miss Davis harbored a festering resentment against what she called ''the contract slave system'' at the studio.         Deciding in 1936 to defy the strictures of her contract, Miss Davis agreed with an English company to go to London to make two movies. Years later she was to ruefully confess that before she left, Jack L. Warner, the studio head, offered her a chance ''to play one of the great screen roles of all time, but I didn't know it.''         '' 'Please don't leave. I just bought a wonderful book for you,' '' she quoted Mr. Warner as saying. ''And I said, 'I'll bet it's a pip!' and walked out of his office.'' She learned later that the role she turned down was Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' Mr. Warner later gave up his option on it.  The Glorious Years  Memorable Roles, One After Another         In England, Miss Davis was sued by Warner Brothers, which succeeded in preventing her from working for another producer while under contract to Warners. But once she had returned to the United States, Warners gave her a new contract calling for fewer pictures at a much higher salary.         They also gave her excellent, high-budget pictures, like ''Jezebel,'' for which she won her second Oscar in 1938. In a single year, 1939, Warners released no fewer than four blockbuster Davis movies: ''Dark Victory,'' ''Juarez,'' ''The Old Maid'' and ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex,''         ''Jezebel'' began her halcyon years, she said, and ''in 1939 I secured my career and my stardom forever; I made five pictures in 12 months, and every one of them made money.''         The memorable Davis roles continued in swift order: The murderous and unfaithful planter's wife in Maugham's ''The Letter'' in 1940, quickly followed the next year by ''The Great Lie'' and ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the scheming Regina Giddens. In 1942 she scored again in ''Now, Voyager,'' as Charlotte Vale, a frumpish spinster who blossoms into a confident beauty and finds true love with Paul Henreid. The film is remembered by movie buffs for the scenes in which Mr. Henreid lights two cigarettes at once and gives one to Miss Davis.         There were other triumphs in the 1940's - ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' ''Watch on the Rhine,'' ''Mr. Skeffington,'' ''The Corn Is Green'' and ''A Stolen Life.'' But Miss Davis's luck began to run out with critical and box-office disasters like ''Winter Meeting'' and ''Deception,'' and in 1949 Warner Brothers, after 19 years, released her from her contract while she was making the ludicrous melodrama ''Beyond the Forest.'' In it a by-then plumpish Miss Davis uttered one of her most famous ''camp'' lines, so often used by her mimics, ''What a dump!''  Anguish and Acclaim  Role of a Lifetime In 'All About Eve'         With the end of the Warners era, Miss Davis's third marriage, to William Grant Sherry, an artist by whom she had a daughter, Barbara Davis Sherry, was also ending. She won custody of her daughter.         Miss Davis had previously been married to Harmon Oscar Nelson Jr., a band leader, and she said in 1982 that on his insistence she had two abortions. ''That's what he wanted,'' she said. ''Being the dutiful wife, that's what I did.'' The marriage ended in divorce.         But for decades afterward, Miss Davis publicly battled with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, insisting that she had bestowed her first husband's middle name on the Oscar. ''The Academy has fought stoically to claim that they named the Oscar,'' she said. ''But of course I did. I named it after the rear end of my husband. Why? Because that's what it looked like.''         Miss Davis's second husband, Arthur Farnsworth, a businessman, died of head injuries suffered in a fall in 1943.         Miss Davis was filming ''Payment on Demand'' in 1949 - it was not released until 1951 - when she was offered a role of a lifetime in what she was to call ''that charmed movie, 'All About Eve.' '' She was a last-minute replacement for Claudette Colbert, for whom the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, had written the role of Margo Channing, the fading Broadway star. Miss Colbert was unable to begin the film on schedule because she ''hurt her back, thank God,'' as Miss Davis liked to recall it.         ''When I finished reading 'All About Eve' I was on Cloud Nine,'' said the actress. ''That night Joe Mankiewicz told me Margo Channing was the kind of dame who would treat her mink coat like a poncho.''         She played Margo that way, and brilliantly, and with the aid of a witty, literate script, sharp direction by Mr. Mankiewicz, and a sparkling cast that included Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, George Sanders, Marilyn Monroe (in a supporting role), and Thelma Ritter, the movie became one of the all-time great Hollywood films.         During the filming of ''All About Eve,'' Miss Davis became romantically involved with her leading man, Gary Merrill, and they were married in 1950. Soon afterward they adopted two children, Margot and Michael.  The 'Darkest Decade'  A Broadway Flop, A Retreat to Maine         Miss Davis received another Oscar nomination for ''The Star,'' released in 1953, but the film was unsuccessful. She was by then 45 and younger actresses were being offered the parts that would have once been hers. She accepted an offer to return to Broadway in a revue, ''Two's Company.''         When the show opened in New York in December 1952, Miss Davis recalled years later, ''The ovation was, to say the least, heartwarming, the reviews were bloodcurdling.'' The revue closed after 90 performances.         Miss Davis and Mr. Merrill took an option to buy a home in Maine and, she said with wry amusement, ''We called our house Witch Way because we didn't know which way we were going and a witch lived there. Guess who?''         ''For three years I was solely a wife and mother and Gary fell out of love with me,'' Miss Davis was to say years later. During that period it also became apparent that the Merrills' adopted daughter, Margot, was retarded, and at the age of 3 she had to be put in a special school. Margot has since lived in homes for the retarded.         During what she was to call her ''darkest decade,'' the 1950's, while the the Merrills' marriage continued to disintegrate, Miss Davis again played Elizabeth I in ''The Virgin Queen'' and a year later, in 1956, appeared in Paddy Chayefsky's ''A Catered Affair'' as Ma Hurley, a Bronx housewife, which she sometimes said was her favorite role. The Merrills also traveled cross-country doing one-night stands in ''The World of Carl Sandburg'' until 1960, when they were divorced.  Friends and Enemies  Fonda, Crawford, Cagney and Flynn         Having settled into character acting, Miss Davis in 1961 scored a success as the gin-soaked ''bag lady'' Apple Annie in ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' That same year she was praised for her performance on Broadway in Tennessee Wiliams's ''The Night of the Iguana,'' which she left in April 1962 to film ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'' a box-office winner that earned her yet another Accademy Award nomination for best actress of the year.         The horror movie, in which Miss Davis wore pasty white makeup and padded herself to appear overweight, revolved around two show-business has-been sisters living in creepy seclusion in a Hollywood mansion. The role of the loony Baby Jane Hansen, addled into thinking she was going to make a comeback in vaudeville, gave Miss Davis a chance to pull out all the acting stops, and she did so with relish. The other, wheelchair-bound, sister was played by Joan Crawford.         The casting of Miss Davis and Miss Crawford in ''Baby Jane'' resuscitated longstanding rumors that they had feuded when both were Warners stars. In 1982 Miss Davis told an interviewer, ''I never feuded with Joan Crawford. During 'Baby Jane' the whole world hoped we would fight but we did not. We were both pros.'' In any event, Miss Davis was not reticent about revealing her rancor against other performers. She accused Miriam Hopkins, with whom she co-starred in ''The Old Maid'' and ''Old Acquaintance,'' of upstaging her and scene-stealing. She also disliked Errol Flynn, her co-star in ''Elizabeth and Essex,'' calling him ''unprofessional.''         Intense as her rivalries were, her friendships were deep and long lasting, particularly for Claude Rains, Henry Fonda, James Cagney, Paul Henreid, Olivia de Havilland, Anne Baxter and Geradine Fitzgerald.         As she grew older, Miss Davis continued making movies, many of them horror thrillers or melodramas, like ''The Anniversary'' (1968), in which she wore a patch over one eye.         Unlike many of her contemporaries who held out against appearing on television when it was in its infancy in the 1950's, Miss Davis embraced it. She appeared as a guest on the Jimmy Durante comedy show, and made episodes of popular series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Perry Mason.''  Writing Her Own Epitaph  'The Sweetness Of My Joy'         Despite advancing age Miss Davis kept on working, appearing on television and in an occasional movie, some of them made for television. She said she worked into her later years because the money came in handy, and work was part of her Yankee heritage. ''It is only work that truly satisfies,'' she said. ''No one has ever understood the sweetness of my joy at the end of a good day's work. I guess I threw everything else down the drain.''         This included her personal life, she said, adding: ''All my marriages were charades, and I was equally responsible. But I always fell in love. That was the original sin.''         It was never a secret that Miss Davis was temperamental, opinionated and often difficult to get along with, but in 1985 a scandalous book about her, by her own daughter, shocked her critics as well as her fans.         In ''My Mother's Keeper,'' B. D. Hyman portrayed Miss Davis as an abusive, domineering and hateful mother and as a grotesque alcoholic who was largely responsible for her own mistreatment by certain of her husbands. Two years later Miss Davis replied to Mrs. Hyman's charges with her own bestseller, 'This 'N That,'' in which she defended herself as the victim of a lying and ungrateful child. She confessed later that her estrangement from her daughter pained her.         For some years after her last divorce Miss Davis lived in Weston, Conn., but in the late 1970's she moved into an apartment in West Hollywood.         ''Indestructible,'' she once said. ''That's the word that's often used to describe me. I suppose it means that I just overcame everything. But without things to overcome, you don't become much of a person, do you?''         ''I know what I want as my epitaph,'' she said. ''Here lies Ruth Elizabeth Davis - she did it the hard way.''         Correction:  November 11, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Oct. 8 about Bette Davis credited her incorrectly with a distinction held by another actress.         As a letter from a reader has pointed out, it is Katharine Hepburn who has received the most Academy Award nominations. The obituary also included a film incorrectly among Miss Davis's nominations. She was not nominated for the 1934 film ''Of Human Bondage.''       
        Ellen Lewis Buell Cash, former children's books editor of The New York Times Book Review, died yesterday in Chattanooga, Tenn. She was 84 years old.         Ellen Lewis Buell Cash, former children's books editor of The New York Times Book Review, died yesterday in Chattanooga, Tenn. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Cash, who was known professionally as Ellen Lewis Buell, ended her 32-year career as a member of the Sunday book review staff in July 1963, retiring to the Cash family farm in Wildwood, Ga., south of Chattanooga.         While working in the world of children's books, she saw the juvenile publishers' annual output of books soar from about 400 titles in the early 1930's to more than 2,300 in 1962.         She was a native of Marietta, Ohio, the daughter of Daniel Hand Buell and the former Ellen Lewis Nye. After graduating from Marietta College, she held a reporting job on her hometown paper in Marietta, then headed for New York City in 1931.         After being hired for The Book Review at The Times, she served as a clerk and secretary, listed new books, answered readers' queries and tried her hand at reviews.         In 1935, The Times decided to institute a regular weekly page on children's books, and Mrs. Cash was assigned to share responsibility for the page with Anne Thaxter Eaton on alternate weeks. When Miss Eaton retired in 1946, Mrs. Cash turned full time to the job of children's editor.         From 1945 to 1961, she taught a course in juvenile literature at Columbia University. She was the author of an anthology for children, ''A Treasury of Little Golden Books,'' and a poetry anthology, ''Read Me a Poem: Children's Favorite Poetry.''         During her retirement, she and her husband, the late Harold Cash, a sculptor, maintained the Cash family farm.         She is survived by several cousins. A funeral service will be held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Chattanooga at 3 P.M. on Friday.       
        Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         As one of the city's earliest and most notable female lawyers, Mrs. Buttenwieser bore the admiration of younger generations modestly, with self-deprecating humor and candor. When the City Bar Association honored her last year at an annual dinner, she noted dryly, ''I'd rather be reading a book.''         As a scion of a powerful family, she followed in its tradition of advocacy, philanthropy and concern for social issues. ''Public service is an obligation,'' Mrs. Buttenwieser once declared. 'Embodied the Concept'         Two passions ruled her professional life: the law and civil liberties. They merged when she became the first chairwoman of the Legal Aid Society, an organization she served for more than 50 years.         ''She embodied the concept of public service, and that her profession recognize its responsibility to people unable to represent themselves,'' said Alexander D. Forger, the current chairman of the Legal Aid Society and chairman of the Manhattan law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. As Legal Aid's first chairwoman, she nevertheless insisted on being referred to as chairman, rather than chairperson.         ''That was her style,'' Mr. Forger said. ''She was of the old school, where matters of gender were less important than doing the job.''         Mrs. Buttenwieser, who was born in Manhattan, was the daughter of two leading figures of ''our crowd,'' the 100 or so German Jewish families who founded leading banking, securities and retailing empires. Her mother, Adele Lewisohn, was the daughter of Adolph Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. Her uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, was a New York Governor and a United States Senator from New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, was Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals. Worked in Settlement House         After two years at Connecticut College, she left and enrolled at the New York School of Social Work. Then, she worked in child guidance in a settlement house. In 1930, she was appointed to the Board of Child Welfare. She turned to the law when she aspired to a judgeship in what is now Family Court.         In 1929, she married Benjamin J. Buttenwieser, a partner in the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. In a typical ''our crowd'' twist, one of her husband's partners wed her sister, and the firm later merged with Lehman Brothers, the family firm.         She graduated from New York University Law School and became the first woman to work at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. She left after a year because of the impending birth of a child.         Mrs. Buttenwieser then set out to fashion a life that would enable her to fuse work, family and community service. She founded her own office and practiced law in Manhattan for 50 years, until she retired in 1986. ''I decided when you get to be 80, you retire,'' she said. A Busy Volunteer         Her volunteer activities continued throughout her life and included many firsts. In 1939, she was the first chairwoman of a standing committee of the New York County Bar Association. Ten years later, she was elected trustee of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company, the first female director of a prominent banking concern.         She was chairwoman of the New York City Committee on Adoptions and often served as a pro bono lawyer for children's aid organizations. Mrs. Buttenwieser and her husband frequently opened their home to foster children.         When asked how she had been able to accomplish so much, she often credited ''a good husband.'' The two were a familiar sight at their regular table at Le Perigord, where they dined every Saturday at 8 P.M. precisely and where they recently celebrated their 60th anniversary.         Mr. Buttenwieser, a prominent philanthropist and civic leader, nurtured his wife's career and shared her causes. Mrs. Buttenwieser, as a tireless defender of Alger Hiss, the former State Department official who was convicted of perjury in 1950 after trials that mesmerized the nation, was the host for Sunday brunches at her home, where the defendant and his advisers and friends would gather. 'Fundamental Values'         ''She was a woman of great spirit and fundamental values - human rights, decency and the quality of individuals,'' said Oscar M. Ruebhausen, a longtime neighbor and retired partner of Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm that defended Mr. Hiss.         Mrs. Buttenwieser put her money where her beliefs were. She was an investor in The Nation, the liberal magazine. She formed a coalition of small family foundations, Joint Foundation Support, to serve philanthropists by providing information on the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.         She was also a former trustee of the New York Civil Liberties Union, a former board member of the Citizens Committee for Children, a former chairwoman of Madison House, a former president of the New York Federation of Jewish Charities, a former board member of the Legal Defense Fund and a former member of the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary.         She was a donor of Adele Lehman Hall at Barnard College, named for her mother, and was a former trustee of Connecticut College and a former board member of the Columbia University School of Social Work and the Dalton School.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Frances L. Loeb of Manhattan; three sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, Peter, of Philadelphia, and Paul, of Boston; nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
