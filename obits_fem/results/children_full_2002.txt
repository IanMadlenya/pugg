         Dr. Ruth Whittemore, a Yale professor who conducted groundbreaking research in pediatric cardiology based on data from clinics she founded in 1940's, died on Dec. 27 in North Branford, Conn. She was 84.         In 1947, at the request of the federal Children's Bureau, Dr. Whittemore set up the first rheumatic fever and cardiac clinic in New England, at the Yale Medical School. Rheumatic fever, which can lead to heart failure if untreated, was common in young children then. But with the advent of penicillin, its incidence began to decline, and Dr. Whittemore shifted her focus to congenital heart disease, a relatively new field then.         Many doctors she trained at her clinic went on to become leading pediatric cardiologists, said Dr. Paul Lurie, a retired specialist in the field.         ''Congenital heart disease was a totally unexplored area at the time she was running her clinic,'' Dr. Lurie said. ''Her clinic was one of the first to specialize in it.''         Dr. Whittemore set up two similar clinics in Connecticut and followed her young patients closely, tracking many into adulthood. The information she collected on her patients in the years she tracked them proved extremely important. In the early 50's, she began a research study in which she examined the health histories of 837 children born to 427 of her former patients and discovered that 10 percent of the children had congenital heart abnormalities.         At a time when genetic predisposition to heart disease was not completely understood, Dr. Whittemore's data showed that children whose parents had heart disease were at a higher risk of developing the disease than the general population. Her study challenged previous smaller studies that concluded there was a much lower risk of inheriting heart disease from a parent.         Born in Newton, Mass., Ruth Whittemore completed her undergraduate studies at Mount Holyoke and earned her medical degree at Johns Hopkins as one of six women in a class of 72.         Two years later, she was part of a team of physicians at Hopkins that performed the first ''blue baby'' operation, a surgical procedure that corrected a congenital heart abnormality that robs the blood of oxygen.         Dr. Whittemore joined the Yale Medical School faculty in 1943. In 45 years there, she held several positions, including director of pediatric cardiology.         She was the author or co-author of more than 50 scholarly papers.         She is survived by her sister-in-law, Margaret Keagy Whittemore of Cape Cod, Mass.; one nephew; and three nieces.       
         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les Célébrités, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Edith Bouvier Beale, once a successful model and aspiring actress who later lived a gothic life in Grey Gardens, a dilapidated 28-room house in East Hampton, N.Y., with her mother and dozens of cats, raccoons and opossums, was found dead in her small apartment in Bal Harbour, Fla., on Jan. 14. She was 84.         Her nephew, Bouvier Beale, said the Dade County coroner attributed the death to a heart attack or stroke resulting from arteriosclerosis. Her cousin, John H. Davis, said she appeared to have been dead for five days.         The two Beale women, an aunt and a cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, became famous when their peculiar living situation was shown in the documentary film ''Grey Gardens,'' made by Albert and David Maysles in 1975. The once-elegant grounds were a tangled jungle; 25 rooms were unused, and the fleas were so thick that the filmmakers wore flea collars around their ankles during the filming.         At one point in the film, Ms. Beale's mother, who had the same name (they were publicly known as Big Edie and Little Edie), laughs when a cat relieves itself behind a youthful portrait of her propped against a bedroom wall.         But the loving but embittered relationship between the two women is perhaps the most compelling theme of the film. In it, the daughter has returned to care for her mother, and repeatedly suggests that life has passed her by as a result. The mother's manner is forcefully controlling.         ''You've had enough fun in your life,'' she tells her daughter, who never stops protesting that she wants to move to New York or Paris.         As young Edie empties a box of cat biscuits for the raccoons in the attic, she says, ''I've been a subterranean prisoner here for 20 years.''         The film drew both rave reviews and hard questions about the invasion of privacy inherent in the Maysleses' trademark technique of using a hand-held camera to capture lives uncomfortably close up. It also provoked comparisons to the memory plays of Tennessee Williams.         ''It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, awfully difficult,'' Little Edie laments in the film.         A startling side effect of the movie has been the continuing interest of the fashion world in the costumes she is shown wearing, including a contrived skirt held over her ample thighs by a pin. She said the skirt could double as a cape.         Italian Vogue and Harper's Bazaar have done photographic layouts of fashions inspired by the movie. Calvin Klein was a fan of the film, and Greta Garbo was said to have been.         Edith Bouvier Beale was born in Manhattan on Nov. 7, 1917. She was the eldest of the 10 grandchildren of John Vernou Bouvier Jr., who spent summers at the family estate in East Hampton, Lasata. Another of the grandchildren was Jacqueline Bouvier, the future first lady.         Mr. Davis, another grandchild and author of ''Bouviers: Portrait of an American Family'' (Farrar, Straus, 1969), said Edie was the family beauty, ''surpassing even the dark charm of Jacqueline.''         Her father was Phelan Beale, a Wall Street lawyer, who raised three children at Grey Gardens on Lily Pond Lane. Her two brothers are dead, and she left no immediate survivors.         The parents' marriage ended in divorce, and Mr. Beale's second wife inherited his estate. Edith, the mother, also incurred the wrath of her father, Major Bouvier, by showing up at the wedding of her son dressed like an opera star, just as the ceremony ended. Two days later, her father cut her out of his will.         She eventually received a $65,000 trust fund, and retained the house her husband gave her in 1923.         Ms. Beale lived a gilded life as a youth. In 1936, The New York Times reported on her debut, at which she wore a gown of white net appliquéd in silver and a wreath of gardenias in her hair.         Starting at 17, she began a successful career as a model. She felt that she was on the verge of a big break into films in 1952, when she was 35. She said she had offers from MGM and Paramount, and that her dance career was set to take off. She also said that wealthy men like Howard Hughes and J. Paul Getty had asked her to marry them.         ''She had a very, very fertile imagination,'' Mr. Davis cautioned.         Whether on the verge of success or not, she was called home to Grey Gardens by her mother, who said she was ill and needed her.         Over the years, things deteriorated. On Oct. 22, 1971, inspectors from the Suffolk County Health Department raided the house and discovered that it violated every known building regulation. In the dining room, they found a five-foot mountain of empty cans; in the upstairs bedrooms, they saw human waste.         The story became a national scandal. Health Department officials said they would evict the women unless the house was cleaned. Mrs. Onassis came to the rescue, paying for a cleanup that included 40 gallons of germicide.         Lee Radziwill, sister of Mrs. Onassis, introduced the Maysleses to her relatives as part of a project she had proposed to film the early years of her and her sister's lives. Though that idea was abandoned, the filmmakers returned to the Beales to suggest a film about them.         The elder Edith Beale died in 1977. Her daughter flirted briefly with a singing career and stayed in Grey Gardens for two years before selling it.         Ms. Beale spent more and more of her time in Florida, where she swam every day. She lived off her small savings.         She had not owned a cat in five years.       
         Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish writer whose rollicking, anarchic books about Pippi Longstocking rattled some tradition-bound Swedes when they first appeared almost 60 years ago but came to captivate millions of children around the world, died yesterday at her home in Stockholm. She was 94.         Mrs. Lindgren, who began publishing in the 1940's, became one of the world's most widely translated authors. In addition to being a beloved cultural figure in Sweden, she was also a powerful political force, successfully lobbying on issues like tax reform and improved conditions for farm animals.         Although Mrs. Lindgren produced more than 70 books for young people, she was best known as the author of the classic ''Pippi Longstocking,'' first published in Sweden in 1945 and in the United States five years later. The title character is a 9-year-old carrot-haired enfant terrible who lives cheerfully by herself in the ramshackle Villa Villekulla and befriends her better behaved, better groomed neighbors, Tommy and Annika.         ''She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy,'' the book begins.         ''Pippi'' and its sequels have together sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. The sheer subversive quality of the books, whose brazen young heroine does exactly as she pleases, made them unusual for juvenile literature.         ''Bertrand Russell has written that a child dreams about power as grown-ups dream sexual wish dreams,'' Mrs. Lindgren said in a 1985 interview. ''This is a child who has power. That is wonderful, for children to think, 'Oh, if I were like Pippi! I could say to Father, '' 'You don't do that!' ''         ''She has power, but she never misuses that power,'' Ms. Lindgren said, ''which I think is the most splendid thing, and the most difficult.''         Mrs. Lindgren was born Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson on Nov. 14, 1907, the second of four children of Samuel August and Hanna Jonsson Ericsson, in Vimmerby, in southern Sweden. Her father was a tenant farmer, and Mrs. Lindgren grew up outside Vimmerby at Nas, a 500-year-old farm, in an old red house surrounded by apple orchards.         ''Rocks and trees were as close to us as living beings, and nature protected and nurtured our playing and our dreaming,'' she wrote in a 1973 memoir. ''Whatever our imagination could call forth was enacted in the land around us -- all fairy tales, all adventures we invented or read about or heard about, all of it happened there, and only there. Even our songs and prayers had their places in surrounding nature.''         The pastoral idyll of Mrs. Lindgren's youth came to an end in 1926, when, 19 and unmarried, she became pregnant. She fled to Copenhagen, where she gave birth to a son, Lars, and later settled in Stockholm.         To support herself, she took a secretarial job at the Royal Automobile Club in Stockholm. (Among Mrs. Lindgren's lesser known writing is the 1939 work ''Twenty-Five Automobile Tours in Sweden.'') In 1931 she married a co-worker, Sture Lindgren. Mrs. Lindgren, who was widowed in 1952, is survived by a sister, Stina Hergin; her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         It was Karin who first conjured up Pippi. In 1941 when she was 7 she was sick in bed with pneumonia. Night after night she nagged her mother to tell her a story.         ''What should I tell?'' the exhausted Mrs. Lindgren asked one evening.         ''Tell about Pippi Langstrump'' -- Pippi Longstocking -- Karin replied, coining the name on the spot.         Her mother gamely complied.         ''I didn't ask her who Pippi Longstocking was,'' Mrs. Lindgren told The New Yorker in 1983. ''I just began the story, and since it was a strange name it turned out to be a strange girl as well.''         Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's daughter Longstocking was indeed a strange girl. Her fiery hair stuck straight out from either side of her head in two tight braids. She wore one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. Her mother was long dead; her sailor father had been lost at sea, though Pippi was confident he had come ashore on a South Sea island where ''he had become king of all the cannibals.'' She had a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nilsson for company and a trunkful of gold pieces to provide for her wants.         Like many heroes of traditional Scandinavian lore, Pippi was fearless, ageless and endowed with superhuman strength.         But above all, Pippi was rude:  deeply, outrageously, satisfyingly rude. Invited to a fancy coffee party, she devoured an entire cream cake before the assembled guests.         The sequel ''Pippi Goes on Board'' was published in Sweden in 1946, followed by ''Pippi in the South Seas'' in 1948, ''Pippi on the Run'' in 1971 and several other Pippi stories not translated into English.         In the 1970's she stepped into public life to protest Sweden's income tax laws, which sent self-employed artists like Mrs. Lindgren and the director Ingmar Bergman reeling under a staggering tax burden. A lifelong supporter of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Mrs. Lindgren published a caustic newspaper satire before the 1976 election in which she calculated that, because of competing local and federal taxes, her income was taxed at an annual rate of 102 percent. The Social Democrats, in power for more than 40 years, were defeated, and tax cuts followed, events Mrs. Lindgren was sometimes credited with bringing about.         Although Mrs. Lindgren's career made her wealthy, she continued to live modestly in the same Stockholm apartment where ''Pippi Longstocking'' was first written, rising early to write in bed before going off to her editing job. She regarded her status as one of Sweden's best loved celebrities with characteristic quiet humor.         ''Perhaps this is because in Stockholm drunks come up and hug me all the time,'' she said in 1994. ''And I cannot be that impressed with anyone, except for God.''       
         Elizabeth Mildred Riley, a prominent children's book editor, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 and lived on the Upper East Side.         Her publishing career was spent at the Thomas Y. Crowell Company, now merged into HarperCollins. She joined the company in 1938, rose to senior vice president in 1959 and retired about 30 years ago.         Ms. Riley built the children's division of Crowell and was especially noted for creating the ''Let's Read and Find Out'' series of science primers, started more than 40 years ago. She founded it with Dr. Franklyn Mansfield Branley, a science writer and teacher, as an introduction to a wide range of scientific subjects, attractively put together with pictures and plainly written texts. The books, designed for children from preschool through the early grades, counted well-known science writers among their authors. They have remained a pre-eminent series for decades, used in schools and libraries across the country.         Now the series is known as the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science Books. More than 100 have been published, with about 80 still in print and 6 new ones released each year by HarperCollins.         Elizabeth Riley, born on the West Side of Manhattan, graduated from New York University in 1928 and received a master's degree from Columbia University two years later. Her first job was selling books at department stores, including Macy's.         Munro Leaf -- a friend who was the creator of ''The Story of Ferdinand,'' the classic children's book about the bull who preferred smelling flowers to fighting other bulls -- recommended her to Crowell, where she started as a general editor. At the time, the publisher offered college textbooks but had nothing in print for young readers.         Ms. Riley was entrusted with creating the publishing house's children's book department, and she built it into one of the best. Many of the books she published won prizes, among them several Newbery medals as well as a Caldecott.         She retired when Crowell was bought by Dun & Bradstreet. From the time she joined Crowell, she had accepted stock options as bonuses; the takeover made her a well-to-do woman. But its terms also barred her from working any longer in children's books; she became a volunteer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, working in textile conservation and helping to organize files and photographs.         For many years Ms. Riley also did volunteer work for the Grolier Club, Unicef, the Hroswitha Society of book collectors, and the Pierpont Morgan Library, where she served on the board for 24 years.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Margaret Loeb Kempner, a philanthropist whose special concerns included the well-being of children, families with children and the elderly, died on Dec. 31 at her home in Purchase, N.Y. She was 102.         In 1999, when Mrs. Kempner had her 100th birthday, she was made an honorary director of The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, a Manhattan hospital with which she had ties for five decades.         Her father was Carl M. Loeb, former president of the American Metal Company and co-founder with his son John Langeloth Loeb of Carl M. Loeb & Company, later to become known as the Wall Street firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         The Loeb family gave the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park to New York City.         Mrs. Kempner and her husband, Alan H., gave money and time to the Kempner Rare Book Library at Columbia University.         Another beneficiary of her philanthropy and fund-raising was the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. She was chairman of the board of its women's division and became a lifetime trustee of its successor organization, the UJA-Federation of New York.         She assisted Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., for almost seven decades, raising money and serving on its board. She played the same roles at The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.         Born in St. Louis, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated in 1917 from the the Horace Mann School for Girls, which closed in 1946.         She married Mr. Kempner in 1920. He died in 1985.         Surviving are two sons, Alan Jr. of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Thomas, of Manhattan; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Virginia Hamilton, an internationally recognized writer for children whose work celebrated the African-American experience as an essential component of American life, died yesterday in Dayton, Ohio. She was 65 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.         The cause was breast cancer, said Kris Moran, director of publicity for Scholastic, Ms. Hamilton's publisher.         Ms. Hamilton, known privately by her married name, Virginia Hamilton Adoff, wrote more than 35 books in many genres that spanned picture books and folk stories, mysteries and science fiction, realistic novels and biography. Among her best-known works are ''The People Could Fly'' (1985), ''The Planet of Junior Brown'' (1971) and ''Many Thousand Gone: African Americans From Slavery to Freedom'' (1993).         She won a National Book Award in 1975 for her novel ''M. C. Higgins, the Great''; the book also received a Newbery award, the first to a black writer. In 1995 she became the first children's author to receive a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant.         Woven into her books is a deep concern with memory, tradition and generational legacy, especially as they helped define the lives of American blacks from the days of slavery onward. Ms. Hamilton described her work as ''liberation literature.''         Virginia Esther Hamilton was born March 12, 1936. She grew up on the small farm in Yellow Springs that had been her family's since the 1850's;  she later returned there with her husband and children.         She came from a family of storytellers. Ms. Hamilton's grandfather Levi Perry was born a slave in Virginia and crossed the Ohio River to freedom. Once a year, she wrote, he gathered his children around him. ''Set down,'' he would say, ''and I will tell you about slavery and why I ran, so that it will never happen to you.'' Ms. Hamilton was named Virginia in remembrance of his flight.         After attending Antioch College and Ohio State University -- she lacked the money to complete her studies -- Ms. Hamilton moved to New York. There, while studying writing at the New School for Social Research, she met the poet Arnold Adoff, whom she married in 1960. Mr. Adoff survives her, as do two sisters, Nina Anthony, of Columbus, Ohio, and Barbara Davis, of Los Angeles; two brothers, William Hamilton, of Englewood, N.J., and Kenneth James Hamilton Jr., of Chula Vista, Calif.; a daughter, Leigh Hamilton Adoff, of Berlin, and a son, Jaime Levi Adoff, of Manhattan.         Ms. Hamilton's first book, ''Zeely,'' appeared in 1967. At the time the few children's books about black people were mainly ''problem'' novels, which threw into sharp relief issues like segregation and poverty.         ''Zeely'' was a radical departure. It was not that race was absent, but that it was so completely, unremarkably present. Ms. Hamilton forsook gritty urban drama for a pastoral tale of enchantment whose characters happened to be black. The novel told the story of a girl who, during a summer on her uncle's farm, is captivated by an enigmatic local woman she believes is a Watusi queen.         Among Ms. Hamilton's many honors were an Edgar Allan Poe Award, a Coretta Scott King Award, a Hans Christian Andersen Medal and an honorary doctorate from Ohio State.         Many of her recent books were devoted to the black oral tradition; she combed dusty archives for early manuscripts with long-forgotten songs, riddles and stories.         The fruits of her travels included ''The People Could Fly,'' which retells slaves' traditional tales in an accessible vernacular, without the ugly misspellings historically used to render black dialect. The title story recounts: ''The one called Driver cracked his whip over the slow ones to make them move faster. That whip was a slice-open cut of pain. So they did move faster. Had to.''         The book's carefully worded subtitle, ''American Black Folktales,'' was itself a political statement, Ms. Hamilton later recalled. Her editor had urged on her the more conventional  ''Black American Folktales.''         ''No,'' Ms. Hamilton replied. ''They're American first and black second.''       
         Annalee Whitmore Fadiman, a screenwriter, World War II correspondent and the author, with Theodore H. White, of the best seller ''Thunder Out of China,'' died yesterday in Captiva, Fla. She was 85.         Mrs. Fadiman, who as a member of the Hemlock Society supported a right to suicide, took her own life, said her daughter, Anne. Mrs. Fadiman had been suffering from breast cancer and Parkinson's disease.         A woman successful in several careers, Mrs. Fadiman spent much of her life defying the conventions of professions dominated by men. Nancy Sorel, in her book ''The Women Who Wrote the War,'' called Mrs. Fadiman's career ''a real-life movie.'' Sidney Skolsky, the 1940's Hollywood columnist, called her ''the girl reporter of this war.''         Annalee Whitmore was born on May 27, 1916, on the kitchen table of her family's home in Price, Utah, the eldest of four children born to Leland Whitmore, a bank president who built and flew airplanes as a hobby, and Anne Sharp Whitmore, who later became a librarian at the main branch of the New York Public Library.         When Mr. Whitmore lost his job during the Depression, the family  moved to California and struggled to make ends meet. Ms. Whitmore attended Piedmont High School and was admitted to Stanford University in 1933 after scoring highest in the state on a college entrance exam.  She graduated in 1937, having served as the first woman to be managing editor of the Stanford Daily newspaper.         She took a $75-a-month secretarial job at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in San Francisco, but quit after a year when her boss asked her to type part of the manuscript of a memoir he had written.         In 1938, she moved to Los Angeles and joined the secretarial pool at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When she heard that MGM needed a film to occupy Judy Garland between ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms,'' she wrote a treatment in a single weekend and became the co-writer of ''Andy Hardy Meets Debutante''(1940), with Garland and Mickey Rooney.         With several more screenplay credits, she was offered a seven-year contract by MGM, but she dreamed of reporting in China, where war was already raging. The War Department allowed no female correspondents in China at that time, so in 1941 she landed a job as the Far East representative of a relief agency. Once in Chungking, writing speeches for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, she won a reporting job with Liberty magazine.         She married Melville Jacoby, a Time magazine correspondent she had first met when they were both Stanford undergraduates. Keeping barely a step ahead of the advancing Japanese forces after Pearl Harbor, they eventually withdrew to Brisbane, Australia. Mr. Jacoby was killed at 25 in an airfield accident near Darwin.         In 1944, Theodore H. White, the Time correspondent (he had been a close friend of Mr. Jacoby), finally persuaded his boss, Henry Luce, to seek War Department accreditation for Ms. Whitmore, so that she could join Mr. White in Chungking. She collaborated with him on ''Thunder Out of China,'' about China's role in the war, the strengths and weaknesses of the Kuomintang and the Communists, and the country's future. The book is still in print.         After the war, Ms. Whitmore wrote articles, lectured widely and appeared on the radio quiz show ''Information Please,'' where she met her second husband, Clifton Fadiman, the program's M.C. and the book reviewer for The New Yorker.         They were married in 1950, and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, of Massachusetts; a son, Kim, of Wyoming; a sister, Carol Whitmore of California; and two grandchildren. Mr. Fadiman died in 1999.       
         Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, whose troubled private life aroused both worldwide sympathy and widespread reprobation, died yesterday morning in London. She was 71.         She suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon, the latest in a series that had left her partly paralyzed in recent months, and developed heart problems overnight, Buckingham Palace said.         The queen announced the death ''with great sadness,'' according to a statement from the palace.         Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is touring West Africa, said he was ''deeply saddened.''         Attractive and fun-loving, Princess Margaret earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit. But her 20's were clouded by an unlucky romance with Group Capt. Peter Townsend of the Royal Air Force, a Battle of Britain hero with whom she fell in love when he served as an equerry to her father, King George VI.         A Daunting Hurdle: Divorce         In many ways, the group captain  might have made an ideal husband. But the fact that he was divorced raised strong objections from the very establishment the royal family represented. As queen, Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, was the supreme governor of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. Moreover, in the early 1950's, the political storm surrounding Edward VIII's abdication in December 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Warfield Simpson, was a not-so-distant memory.         News media scrutiny was relentless and the pressure intense on Princess Margaret, then third in line to the throne, to break off the relationship. Bowing to the demands of a moral code that a decade later would seem quaint to many people, she chose not to marry him.         In May 1960 she married Anthony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who was himself the child of divorced parents. Their tempestuous marriage produced two children, but ended in divorce in 1978. The princess did not remarry, but her friendships with men, from prominent people like the actor Peter Sellers to less exalted ones like Roderic Llewellyn, an upper-class drifter 17 years her junior whose main accomplishment appeared to be a talent for gardening, hurt her reputation.         So did the fact that she was often less than gracious when faced with the drudgery of public appearances -- the ribbon-cuttings, diplomatic functions and endless other official occasions by which Britain's royals justify their position and the public money that finances it. Easily bored and often petulant, the princess was known for indulging her moods, which could swing, as Charles Hussey, a British journalist wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, from ''a gaiety that was sometimes febrile'' to ''Hanoverian gloom.''         Her extravagant style also prompted outrage. Her wedding cost the British government £25,000 -- then the equivalent of $65,000 -- and her six-week honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia cost £40,000, or about $115,000. In later years she was criticized for demanding motorcycle escorts and government helicopters to travel around Britain.         Yet admirers spoke warmly of her personal generosity, loyalty to the queen and to her friends, and her irreverent sense of of fun. Louis Armstrong, whose music she loved, once referred to her as ''one hip chick,'' and John Lennon playfully nicknamed her ''Priceless Margarine.''         To many people, Princess Margaret was the black sheep of her generation of royals. But that reputation did not necessarily trouble her. According to a biographer, Theo Aronson, she once told the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, ''Disobedience is my joy.''         Princess Margaret Rose was born on Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis, Scotland, the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, six years before her father became King George VI with the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.         The Family Braved the Blitz         She was educated at home with her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth II.  During World War II, when the king and queen tried to present an image of both stoicism and good cheer to a battered nation, they rejected the suggestion that their two daughters be sent to Canada to be safe from the danger of the blitz. Instead, the two girls remained with their parents, very much in the public eye.         But with Elizabeth clearly being groomed as the next queen, Princess Margaret was often relegated to the background. According to some courtiers, her parents tried to make up for it by indulging her. ''When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one,'' Princess Margaret told Andrew Duncan, author of ''The Reality of Monarchy'' (1970). ''That was boring so the press tried to make out that I was wicked as hell.''         But in threadbare postwar Britain, the press often portrayed her as a glamorous, high-spirited young woman who delighted in trips to Paris and dancing through the night in fashionable London clubs.         After Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece in November 1947, Princess Margaret became one of the most eligible single women in the world, and her name was coupled with various fashionable young men.         She first met Group Captain Townsend during the war, when he joined King George's entourage. The group captain's heroism -- he shot down 11 German planes -- was coupled with a low-key style that appealed to the king. Indeed, King George was godfather to one of his two sons by his wife, Rosemary Pawle, whom he married in 1941 and divorced in 1952 on the ground of adultery.         His relationship with the princess grew closer after the king's death in February 1952, but it did not become public until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, when Margaret, in a gesture of affection that was captured by news photographers, brushed some lint from his uniform.         Princess Margaret was then 22 and Group Captain Townsend 38. He later wrote that their love ''took no heed of wealth and rank and all the other worldly, conventional barriers which separated us.''         But under the Royal Marriages Act, passed in the reign of George III, Princess Margaret could not marry without the sovereign's permission. Under intense media scrutiny, the affair became as politicized as the one involving King Edward and Mrs. Simpson 16 years before. Both Winston Churchill and the queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, advised against allowing the marriage. Pressing Group Captain Townsend to end the romance, the British government posted him to the British Embassy in Brussels as air attaché in June 1953. Princess Margaret learned of his posting while she was on a tour of Rhodesia.  After her return, the lovers kept in touch by telephone and managed to see each other secretly.         But the government continued to oppose a marriage, and though Princess Margaret turned 25 in 1955 and was thus free to marry without the queen's consent, it was made plain to her that if she chose to marry Group Captain Townsend she would lose her royal rights and income. In October of that year, the couple met in Britain, discussed their situation, and came to a decision.         ''I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend,'' Princess Margaret announced in a statement. ''Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.''         Sympathetic observers later said that if the couple had been permitted to marry, the princess would have settled down to a more conventional life, like her sister. But in his 1978 autobiography, ''Time and Chance,''  Group Captain Townsend wrote, ''I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.''         In 1959 the group captain married Marie Luce Jamagne, a 20-year-old Belgian. The next year, on May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Mr. Armstrong-Jones, also a commoner, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon.         A photographer who made a successful career out of photographing the rich and famous, Mr. Armstrong-Jones also enjoyed the the Bohemian side of London life. He and the princess helped liven the staid image of the royal family with a touch of the Swinging Sixties.         Garland Was Not Amused         But Princess Margaret's love of fun and informality coexisted with a  sterner side. She insisted that she be addressed as ''Ma'am,'' except for her closest friends, who were permitted to call her ''Ma'am darling.'' As a houseguest she was notoriously demanding. At parties she often objected if other guests ignored royal protocol and left before her. Even her children were expected to refer to her as ''Princess Margaret'' in front of visitors. So did her husband,  though he was said to have called her Ducky in private.         The haughty manner alienated many friends. Mr. Aronson relates in ''Princess Margaret'' (1977) how at a party in Beverly Hills she once told Judy Garland through an intermediary that she would like to hear her sing. Angered by the form of the request, Miss Garland replied, ''Tell her I'll sing if she christens a ship first.''         Although the princess and her husband appeared to have a happy family life, by the late 1960's there were nasty public quarrels. This, coupled with an often ill-concealed irritability at official functions and a love of reveling, brought growing public ridicule.         Increasingly resentful of life in the public eye, Lord Snowdon began to spend more time away from the princess, working abroad on photographic projects, sometimes in the company of attractive young women. Princess Margaret also went her own way. She was linked romantically with Anthony Barton, a friend of her husband, and then had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and former army officer who was the nephew of a former prime minister and played the piano in nightclubs.         In February 1967, when the British press began reporting that the royal couple were about to break up, Lord Snowdon, who was working overseas, and Princess Margaret arranged to meet in New York and fly on to the Bahamas, trying to give the impression that nothing was amiss. Shortly afterward, Princess Margaret wrote to Mr. Douglas-Home breaking off the affair. Eighteen months later he committed suicide.         Although the royal couple had made a show of togetherness and were often photographed with their children -- David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones (Viscount Linley) and Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (Lady Sarah Chatto) -- their relations continued to deteriorate.         At Home on a Caribbean Isle         Princess Margaret was often seen in the company of famous men, including Mr. Sellers. She also began to spend more time on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where a friend, Colin Tenant, had given her land as a wedding present and where she built a vacation home known as Les Jolies-Eaux.         In September 1973, at a luncheon in Edinburgh, she met the 25-year-old  Roderic Llewellyn, who soon became a favorite companion. The son of minor nobility, Mr. Llewellyn had worked briefly at a mine in southern Africa and as an apprentice brewer in England. Five months after meeting Princess Margaret he spent three weeks as her guest in Mustique. Although their relationship was soon an open secret in royal circles. the queen, according to Mr. Aronson, was said to have disapproved of Mr. Llewellyn and what she called ''my sister's guttersnipe life.'' But the liaison remained unknown to the public.         Then in February 1976 a news photographer's picture of the couple together on the island caused a scandal. In March the royal family announced that Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret were separating.         Meanwhile, the relationship between the princess and Mr. Llewellyn set off a storm in Parliament. When Mr. Llewellyn was hospitalized with stomach problems during a trip to the Caribbean in March 1978, reports that the princess went to his bedside prompted critics to demand that her royal allowance -- then more than $100,000 a year -- be cut. The battle was played out in the newspapers, with some calling for her to end her relationship with Mr. Llewellyn and take her work more seriously, and others writing in her defense.         Although she was patron of more than 80 charities and organizations, colonel in chief of the Highland Fusiliers of Canada and president of the Royal Ballet, there was increasing resentment of her approach to her duties. Critics complained that the number of her public appearances, which had once averaged 150 a year, had dwindled to well below 100. Some Labor members of Parliament called her an embarrassment to the monarchy.         Then in May, while she was hospitalized with hepatitis, Kensington Palace, where she lived, issued a statement announcing her divorce, an action that ended a 400-year-old taboo on divorce in the royal family.         In the fall, Princess Margaret, on an official visit to Tuvalu in the South Pacific, became ill and had to be flown to Sydney, Australia, for treatment. That December, a month after her return to Britain, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who had been married to a film director.         Princess Margaret's traumatic private life had long taken a toll on her health. She smoked heavily and her enthusiasm for Scotch sometimes shocked her companions. In 1974, according to Mr. Aronson, she suffered a nervous breakdown.         The princess herself remained reticent about her private life. ''I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast,'' she once said.         Sometimes, however, she had a penchant for saying the wrong thing. In October 1979, six weeks after Earl Mountbatten was killed by Irish Republican Army terrorists, she angered many Irish-Americans while on a visit to Chicago, reportedly declaring in the presence of Mayor Jane Byrne that the Irish were ''pigs.''         But she could also be quite gracious. In 1980, when Mr. Llewellyn told her that he was breaking off their relationship to marry Tatiania Soskin, a fashion designer, she assured the younger couple she would be happy to attend their wedding, and she remained friends with both.         Lunch With an Old Lover         As the 1980's progressed, public interest turned to the romantic travails of the next generation of royals. Two of the queen's three sons -- Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Andrew, the Duke of York -- married and divorced under the glare of relentless publicity. Anne, the princess royal and the queen's only daughter, was permitted to divorce her husband, Capt. Mark Philips, and in 1992 married a royal equerry.         Through the years the princess  had corresponded with Peter Townsend and in 1992, while he was on a rare visit to Britain, she invited him to lunch at Kensington Palace attended by several other people. The 77-year-old group captain and the 61-year-old princess sat and ''chatted like the old friends they were.'' Group Captain Townsend died in Paris in 1995.         It was often speculated how different her life might have been had the two been allowed to marry.         ''In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, at the time of Group Captain  Townsend's death. ''After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret's life. The queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they've gone too far in the other direction.''         Princess Margaret is survived by her son, Lord Linley, her daughter, Lady Sarah, and three grandchildren.         As she grew older, the princess  lived less in the public eye. ''They leave me alone these days,'' Mr. Aronson quoted her as saying. ''Today they have other fish to fry.''         Correction:  February 15, 2002, Friday  Because of an editing error, a television review on Feb. 4 about ''Bertie and Elizabeth,'' a ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation on the life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, misstated the policy of the Church of England on divorce, a factor in the abdication of her brother-in-law King Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor. An obituary of her daughter Princess Margaret on Sunday also included the error. The church does not forbid divorce. It revokes the right to marry in a parish church while a former spouse is living. But even then, depending on circumstances, a priest can allow a church wedding.       
         Pauline Trigère, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan last night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley. She was 93.         ''Fashion is what people tell you to wear,'' she often said. ''Style is what comes from your own inner thing.'' She herself was an exemplar of style, and was described by her peers as ''a truly intellectual designer'' and ''a creator of timeless fashion'' in ready-to-wear clothes.         Her 50th anniversary in fashion, a milestone reached by no other designer in this country, was celebrated in 1992 at a benefit fashion show and dinner at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. It was attended by 600 of the most influential names in design, manufacturing and retailing, as well as by scores of social and theater personalities who were both clients and friends. The following year, at a ceremony at Lincoln Center, Miss Trigère received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.         She was noted not only for her designing skills, but also for her tailoring and such touches as constructing dresses with no obvious seams.         She did not sketch her designs: in the tradition of Lanvin and Chanel, she cut and draped from bolts of fabric. Her clothes were worn by such women as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Beverly Sills, Evelyn Lauder, Rita Gam and Dina Merrill.         Miss Trigère wore only her own designs, and she generally punctuated them with several of her trademark turtle pins. She was known both for her meticulous grooming and for a charm that surmounted her blunt, sometimes impolitic comments, spoken in a Gallic accent she never lost.         On occasion a prima donna, a description she never challenged (she once told an assistant ''There is room for only one prima donna around here, and that's me''), she was often impatient. But her displays of temper were brief. She admitted that she was outspoken to a fault, but seemed to revel in that image. A woman meeting her at a social event once gushed, ''Oh, Miss Trigère, I have a dress of yours that I've worn for 25 years.'' The designer fixed her with an icy glance and said, ''Just what am I to do with that piece of information?''         Once, when she was approached by two retailers while dining in a restaurant after one of her shows, she asked them, ''Did you come to copy or to buy?''         She was also a woman of strong beliefs. In 1961, she became the first name designer to use an African- American model. She rarely hesitated to offer an opinion and had no reservations about discussing her life and background -- with one exception. She steadfastly refused to reveal her age and sloughed off questions on the subject with ''I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond and I don't touch it up.'' For years, a silver streak intersected her simple hair style, but gradually she allowed the streak to evolve into a blend of salt sprinkled with pepper.         She finally revealed her age in 1998 when she held a 90th-birthday party for herself with 200 guests at La Grenouille restaurant in Manhattan. (During the festivities she announced that her age on the invitation had been printed upside down).         Unlike almost all other name designers, who stage their shows without commentary and emerge only at the finale to the sound of applause, Miss Trigère usually stood on the stage during her presentations, eyes partly obscured by tinted glasses, and talked about each design as it appeared. She interspersed information about fabric and style with somewhat Rabelaisian humor. Typical of her remarks was one she made at the appearance of a dress with a particularly revealing décolletage. ''You can see the boobs better,'' she said. During a personal appearance, she was asked what she really wanted to be. ''A courtesan,'' she replied.         Miss Trigère was born in 1908 in the Pigalle district of Paris to Russian-Jewish parents. Her mother was a dressmaker and her father a tailor who had made military uniforms for Russian aristocrats. She grew up behind the shop in Paris and picked up pins for a few centimes a week. She remembered designing her first dress in her early teens, although, she said, she never particularly wanted or intended to be in the fashion business. As a young woman, she preferred taking part in amateur theatrical productions and even thought of becoming a surgeon, an ambition nipped by her father before it was even a bud.         She married Lazar Radley, a Russian immigrant and a tailor, because, she said, ''I was young, my mother worried about me, he wanted to marry me and so I did.'' She had two sons before her husband, increasingly concerned about the rise of Hitler, decided to leave France. The Radleys left Paris in 1937 and were bound for Chile with what was to be a brief stopover in New York. But, she recalled, ''New York captured my heart,'' and the family settled in Manhattan.         Within a short time, the Radleys opened a small tailoring business with Miss Trigère's brother, Robert.         Five years later, in 1942, Mr. Radley walked out on the marriage, leaving his wife to bring up the two children. Some years later, he wrote to ask for a divorce. Miss Trigère signed the papers and never heard from him again. She did not remarry, but she had several of what she termed ''longstanding friendships.''         ''Don't say 'beaux' -- I hate the word 'beau,' '' she always exclaimed when the subject came up.         She is survived by her two sons, Jean-Pierre Radley and Philippe Radley and a granddaughter, Karen, all of Manhattan.         Although the original business ended when Mr. Radley left, the following year, Miss Trigère and her brother were back with a collection of 11 styles. Within three years, her name was a recognized one in fashion. In the ensuing decades, she received, in addition to three Coty Awards and inclusion in the Coty Hall of Fame, major fashion awards from Neiman Marcus and Filene's, the National Cotton Award and both the silver and the vermeil medals of the City of Paris.         In addition to creating women's fashions, at various times Miss Trigère also designed scarves, jewelry and men's ties. She also developed her own perfume, called Trigère.         Although new and younger designers gradually replaced her at the top of the fashion hierarchy, and a number of stores that had been important customers went out of business, Miss Trigère continued to design collections and to take part in fashion press weeks until 1994. She closed her ready-to-wear business at that time, partly because several of her principal accounts went into bankruptcy, owing her money. She moved out of her prestigious Seventh Avenue showrooms and took a small space elsewhere in the fashion district, forming a company called P. T. Concepts to market her scarves and jewelry. It was during this period that she underwent several eye and throat operations. She gave up even her smaller space in 2000.         Despite her sophistication, she never lost a sense of delight and wonder at the friendships she enjoyed with many of the illustrious names in the fashion, arts, business and political worlds. She entertained frequently, both in her Manhattan apartment and at her country house, called La Tortue (the Turtle), in South Salem, N.Y. She was known as an excellent cook, and in both homes the atmosphere was informal but carefully orchestrated. She was one of the first hostesses to set a formal table but to have guests follow her into the kitchen to pick up their second courses buffet style.         Once she bought her country house, she spent several years tripling its size. ''I'm engaged, married and completely devoted to this house,'' she once said. She was equally passionate about the grounds, and was a dedicated and knowledgeable gardener.         She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country.         ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline Trigère.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.         Miss Trigère's family said there would be a viewing tonight at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on the Upper West Side.       
         Pauline Trigère, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan on Wednesday night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley. She was 93.         ''Fashion is what people tell you to wear,'' she often said. ''Style is what comes from your own inner thing.'' She herself was an exemplar of style, and was described by her peers as ''a truly intellectual designer'' and ''a creator of timeless fashion'' in ready-to-wear clothes.         Her 50th anniversary in fashion, a milestone reached by no other designer in this country, was celebrated in 1992 at a benefit fashion show and dinner at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. It was attended by 600 of the most influential names in design, manufacturing and retailing, as well as by scores of social and theater personalities who were both clients and friends. The following year, at a ceremony at Lincoln Center, Miss Trigère received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.         She was noted not only for her designing skills, but also for her tailoring and such touches as constructing dresses with no obvious seams.         She did not sketch her designs: in the tradition of Lanvin and Chanel, she cut and draped from bolts of fabric. Her clothes were worn by such women as Beverly Sills, Evelyn Lauder, Rita Gam and Dina Merrill.         Miss Trigère wore only her own designs, and she generally punctuated them with several of her trademark turtle pins. She was known both for her meticulous grooming and for a charm that surmounted her blunt, sometimes impolitic comments, spoken in a Gallic accent she never lost.         On occasion a prima donna, a description she never challenged (she once told an assistant ''There is room for only one prima donna around here, and that's me''), she was often impatient. But her displays of temper were brief. She admitted that she was outspoken to a fault, but seemed to revel in that image. A woman meeting her at a social event once gushed, ''Oh, Miss Trigère, I have a dress of yours that I've worn for 25 years.'' The designer fixed her with an icy glance and said, ''Just what am I to do with that piece of information?''         Once, when she was approached by two retailers while dining in a restaurant after one of her shows, she asked them, ''Did you come to copy or to buy?''         She was also a woman of strong beliefs. In 1961, she became the first name designer to use an African- American model. She rarely hesitated to offer an opinion and had no reservations about discussing her life and background -- with one exception. She steadfastly refused to reveal her age and sloughed off questions on the subject with ''I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond and I don't touch it up.''  She finally revealed her age in 1998 when she held a 90th-birthday party for herself with 200 guests at La Grenouille restaurant in Manhattan. (During the festivities she announced that her age on the invitation had been printed upside down).         Unlike almost all other name designers, who stage their shows without commentary and emerge only at the finale to the sound of applause, Miss Trigère usually stood on the stage during her presentations, eyes partly obscured by tinted glasses, and talked about each design as it appeared. She interspersed information about fabric and style with somewhat Rabelaisian humor. Typical of her remarks was one she made at the appearance of a dress with a particularly revealing décolletage. ''You can see the boobs better,'' she said. During a personal appearance, she was asked what she really wanted to be. ''A courtesan,'' she replied.         Miss Trigère was born in 1908 in the Pigalle district of Paris to Russian-Jewish parents. Her mother was a dressmaker and her father a tailor who had made military uniforms for Russian aristocrats. She grew up behind the shop in Paris and picked up pins for a few centimes a week. She remembered designing her first dress in her early teens, although, she said, she never particularly wanted or intended to be in the fashion business. As a young woman, she preferred taking part in amateur theatrical productions and even thought of becoming a surgeon, an ambition nipped by her father before it was even a bud.         She married Lazar Radley, a Russian immigrant and a tailor, because, she said, ''I was young, my mother worried about me, he wanted to marry me and so I did.'' She had two sons before her husband, increasingly concerned about the rise of Hitler, decided to leave France. The Radleys left Paris in 1937 and were bound for Chile with what was to be a brief stopover in New York. But, she recalled, ''New York captured my heart,'' and the family settled in Manhattan.         Within a short time, the Radleys opened a small tailoring business with Miss Trigère's brother, Robert.         Five years later, in 1942, Mr. Radley walked out on the marriage, leaving his wife to bring up the two children. Some years later, he wrote to ask for a divorce. Miss Trigère signed the papers and never heard from him again. She did not remarry, but she had several of what she termed ''longstanding friendships.''         ''Don't say 'beaux' -- I hate the word 'beau,' '' she always exclaimed when the subject came up.         She is survived by her two sons, Jean-Pierre Radley and Philippe Radley, and a granddaughter, Karen, all of Manhattan.         Although the original business ended when Mr. Radley left, the following year, Miss Trigère and her brother were back with a collection of 11 styles. Within three years, her name was a recognized one in fashion. In the ensuing decades, she received, in addition to three Coty Awards and inclusion in the Coty Hall of Fame, major fashion awards from Neiman Marcus and Filene's, the National Cotton Award and both the silver and the vermeil medals of the City of Paris. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor in December in New York.         In addition to creating women's fashions, at various times Miss Trigère also designed scarves, jewelry and men's ties.         Although new and younger designers gradually replaced her at the top of the fashion hierarchy, and a number of stores that had been important customers went out of business, Miss Trigère continued to design collections and to take part in fashion press weeks until 1994. She closed her ready-to-wear business at that time, partly because several of her principal accounts went into bankruptcy, owing her money. She moved out of her prestigious Seventh Avenue showrooms and took a small space elsewhere in the fashion district, forming a company called P. T. Concepts to market her scarves and jewelry. It was during this period that she underwent several eye and throat operations. She gave up even her smaller space in 2000.         Despite her sophistication, she never lost a sense of delight and wonder at the friendships she enjoyed with many of the illustrious names in the fashion, arts, business and political worlds. She entertained frequently, both in her Manhattan apartment and at her country house, called La Tortue (the Turtle), in South Salem, N.Y. She was known as an excellent cook, and in both homes the atmosphere was informal but carefully orchestrated.         Once she bought her country house, she spent several years tripling its size. ''I'm engaged, married and completely devoted to this house,'' she once said. She was equally passionate about the grounds, and was a dedicated and knowledgeable gardener.         She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country. ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline Trigère.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.       
         Mary Stuart, a veteran actress and pioneer of soap operas who spent 35 years as the star of one daytime series built around her, died on Thursday at her home in New York. She was 76.         She died after a stroke, but had been ill with gastric cancer and bone cancer, her family said.         Legions of fans lived with and felt they knew her two most famous characters, Joanne Gardner Barron Tate Vincente Tourneur on ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and Meta Bauer on ''The Guiding Light.''         Ms. Stuart, whose original name was Mary Houchins, was born in Miami and grew up in Tulsa, Okla. She started performing in early childhood. When she was 9, Count Basie's orchestra came through town, and held a contest to find a young female singer to perform with them. They chose Ms. Stuart, and she sang ''Little Girl Blue'' at two of their shows, said her husband, Wolfgang Neumann, an architect. The shows were late, so the band provided a cot backstage so she could sleep between sets.         The story of her rise to stardom resembles a Hollywood fantasy. At 17 she hitchhiked to New York, working at various jobs to support herself. For a little while she was a booking agent for an airline. ''Her sense of geography was absolutely abysmal,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''She didn't last long there.''         She became a hat-check and cigarette girl at the Roosevelt Hotel, where she met the film producer Joe Pasternak, who offered her a screen test. Her nerves got the better of her at the audition, her husband said, and Mr. Pasternak reportedly told her: ''You can't sing, you can't walk, but there is something that you have. Let's find out what it is.''         She spent the next few years working in movies in Hollywood, mostly in small parts, but sometimes with an icon of 1940's cinema. She appeared in more than 20 films, including ''The Girl From Jones Beach'' with Ronald Reagan, ''The Adventures of Don Juan'' with Errol Flynn and ''This Time for Keeps'' with Esther Williams.         After a few years, she returned to New York. ''She realized she wasn't cut out for Hollywood,'' her husband said. ''It was too ruthless.''         In 1951, she won the role of Jo in a new CBS soap opera, ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and played the long-suffering Joanne until 1986, when the show, which had moved to NBC, went off the air.         When not acting, Ms. Stuart read to children in the public schools of New York as part of a program called Book PALS (Performing Artists for Literacy in Schools), a program of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation to encourage children to read for pleasure. She started the New York chapter of the program in 1992. She also started a a Reading Club in 1996 for 4th and 5th graders in six schools. Today, more than 3,300 children in 10 schools are members. Nationally, the program is in 18 cities.         Her character on ''Search for Tomorrow'' endured many hardships and husbands, but remained noble and dignified throughout them, and broke new ground along the way. She was the first daytime actress to have her pregnancy written into the plot. The producers even filmed Ms. Stuart at the hospital after she gave birth to her son in 1956.         ''They filmed her in her hospital bed, to satisfy the fans and let them share in her happiness,'' said Mary Alice Dwyer-Dobbin, executive in charge of Procter & Gamble Productions.         Her son's career on the show was short-lived, however. Within a few days his character was killed off in an accident, much to the horror of his mother and the viewers. ''She really played the death of her son,'' said her daughter, Cynthia, ''and it was too painful for viewers to watch.''         Ms. Stuart was married twice before. In addition to her husband, daughter and son, Jeffrey Krolik of California, she is survived by two grandchildren.         For some of her fans her character was real. ''It was just like famìly,'' said Theresa Cristalli, who watched ''Search for Tomorrow''  from the very beginning. ''You keep watching day after day. I got hooked on them.''         Ms. Stuart was as loyal to her fans as they were to her. She responded to as much of her fan mail as she could, her daughter said. She even befriended some; she invited Ms. Cristalli and a friend to view the last taping of the show in 1986, and they kept in touch through cards and letters over the years.         Correction:  March 6, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of the soap opera star Mary Stuart on Sunday misstated her age. She was 75, not 76.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.         Correction:  March 15, 2002, Friday  An obituary on March 6 about Theresa Castro, who with her husband established the company that makes Castro Convertible sofas, omitted some survivors. Mrs. Castro had six grandchildren, not four, and seven great-grandchildren, not five.       
         Eda J. LeShan, a psychologist and family counselor who brought psychoanalytic insights and common sense to two dozen books meant to guide people through life's challenges, died on March 2 at her home in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was kidney failure, said a nephew, Bruce LeShan.         Ms. LeShan was known for the motherly warmth she brought to books like ''The Conspiracy Against Childhood'' (Atheneum, 1967), her best-known work on raising children; her radio commentaries on CBS; and her show on PBS, ''How Do Your Children Grow?''         Her message to harried parents was to ease off on the pressure, and sometimes allow children to just daydream. She thought that the discussion of love was central to sex education, and that spanking could only make the child feel as bad as the angry parent.         She said every parent should have a sampler on the wall that says, ''I'm only human.'' Raising a child, she said, is like gardening, because each flower develops differently.         A reviewer in Publishers Weekly in 1978 wrote, ''Adults and young people have benefited from LeShan's fluent, sympathetic writing in books addressed to those in trouble.''         Eda Joan Grossman was born in Manhattan on June 6, 1922. Her mother, Jean Schick Grossman, was a parent educator, and her father, Max Grossman, was a lawyer and president of the Ethical Culture Society of New York.         She graduated from the Fieldston School in Riverdale, and received a degree in early childhood education from Teachers College at Columbia University. She earned a master's degree in child psychology from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.         Her life amounted to personal testimony to her message that people could continue to grow throughout their lives.         She wrote her first book when she was 43, began to appear regularly on a television show when she was 46 and got her own program on educational television when she was 48.         In addition to her books, which have been translated into nine languages, and her television and radio shows, she wrote a regular column for Newsday for years and was a contributing editor of Parents magazine. Her articles appeared in many magazines, including The New York Times Magazine in the 1960's. For nine years, she wrote the ''Talking It Over'' column for Woman's Day.         As she aged, she wrote more about older people. Her books include ''The Wonderful Crisis of Middle Age: Some Personal Reflections'' (McKay, 1973), ''Oh, to Be Fifty Again!'' (Random House, 1986) and ''Grandparents: A Special Kind of Love'' (Macmillan, 1984).         ''I used to be a child psychologist and I love children and I kind of miss that part of my life,'' she said in an interview on ''CBS This Morning'' in 1990. ''But I try to write the same way when I'm writing for older people, where I share my vulnerabilities and my aches and pains and my mood swings and so forth.''         She wrote a play in her 70's. It was called ''The Lobster Reef,'' in reference to the vulnerability lobsters experience when they shed their shells and are completely naked until they grow a new one. It told the story of a woman battling to rid herself of literal and figurative cancers.         When the one-woman play opened in 1995 on Ms. LeShan's 73rd birthday, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times that it was ''a striking creation'' that brought to life four generations. He wrote that it would be interesting to see what she could do if she put more than one character on stage.         She is survived by her husband, Lawrence LeShan, and their daughter, Wendy, who also lives in Riverdale.       
         Rosetta LeNoire, a theatrical producer and a pioneer of nontraditional casting who also played the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on the television show ''Family Matters,'' died on Sunday in Teaneck, N.J. She was 90.         She lived at the Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home in Englewood, N.J., after spending most of her life in the Bronx, said Donna Trinkoff, producing director of the Amas Musical Theater. Miss LeNoire founded Amas, a nonprofit theater group, in 1968, partly to promote interracial casting. The company produced hits including ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         Miss LeNoire's life coincided with glittering moments in show business. Her godfather was Bill Robinson, the tap dancer known as Bojangles, and her music teacher was the jazz pianist and composer Eubie Blake. She was directed by Orson Welles in his all-black version of ''Macbeth'' in the 1930's.         She acted in some of the earliest television shows, and once joked that she seemed to play every maid's role on Broadway.         Perhaps as a result, she was an early and effective advocate of expanding opportunities for minority performers to act in plays and musicals. In 1989, her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who was then president of Actors' Equity, chose Miss LeNoire as the first recipient of what became the union's annual award for broadening participation in theater. The award was named for her.         ''Rosetta created nontraditional casting before the phrase itself was created,'' The New York Beacon, a newspaper with a largely black readership, said in 1997.         In 1999, President Clinton lauded her long fight against discrimination as he presented her with the National Medal of the Arts, one of her many honors.         ''Rosetta did more than dream of a theater with no color bar -- she actually built one,'' he said.         Miss LeNoire, whose name was originally Rosetta Burton, was born in 1911 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan. Her paternal grandfather played the organ for five churches in the West Indies, and her father was one of the first black plumbers and electricians licensed by New York State.         When she was a child, her mother died of pneumonia at the age of 27 after giving birth to her brother in a Harlem hospital corridor because segregated policies barred her from a room. Rosetta was crippled with rickets, a result of vitamin deprivation, and when she was 7 doctors broke her legs so the bones could grow properly.         Mr. Robinson, a member of the Elks Club with her father, volunteered to become godfather of the girl he called Brown Sugar. At 13, when her leg braces came off, she began music lessons with Mr. Blake, who told her to ''look up and be proud of yourself.'' When she was 15, she became a chorus girl with the Time Steppers, Mr. Robinson's troupe.         A marriage to an elevator operator ended in divorce. She then married Egbert Brown, who owned a fleet of cabs; he died after 26 years of marriage.         She is survived by her son, William, of Manahawkin, N.J.; her sister, Mary A. Francis of Palm Coast, Fla.; her brothers, Wilmote Burton of the Bronx, and Warren Burton of Palm Coast; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Study at a government-sponsored Works Progress Administration program at a theater on the Lower East Side led to a role in the all-black version of ''Macbeth,'' which Orson Welles was producing in Harlem. She toured with the production.         ''Good lord! He was a delegate from heaven,'' she said of Mr. Welles. ''He was the only one who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to Shakespeare.''         Later she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to acting, she cared for Mr. Jones's infant son, James Earl Jones.         She made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''The Hot Mikado,'' an all-black version of the operetta.         ''It was something,'' she said. ''There were 125 of us, all black Japanese.''         Her other theater credits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Sunshine Boys,'' ''Lost in the Stars,'' ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Sophie.'' She played the role of Stella in ''Anna Lucasta'' in 1944, toured with the show and starred in the 1958 film version, with Sammy Davis Jr. and Eartha Kitt. Her other movie credits include ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Playing for Keeps'' and ''Brewster's Millions.''         She worked in television during its experimental days, and later appeared in ''Search for Tomorrow,'' ''The Guiding Light,'' ''Amen'' and ''A World Apart. She played Nell Carter's mother, Mama, on NBC's ''Gimme a Break'' and was Mother Winslow on ABC's ''Family Matters'' for eight years.         Eight years after founding Amas, she added a children's theatrical course to its program. (Amas is a form of the verb ''to love'' in Latin.) The company's hits included ''Bojangles'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' a Tony nominee in 1976.         ''I produce musicals,'' she said. ''Music is one avenue where no one seems to have any discriminatory attitudes.''       
         Luise Rinser, a schoolteacher who faced execution by the Nazis and lived to write about it, becoming one of the most celebrated and politically engaged authors in Germany, died last Sunday at a retirement home in Upper Bavaria. She was 90 and had lived for many years in Rome.         A best-selling novelist, diarist, short-story writer and political essayist, Ms. Rinser published about 30 books. Her works sold more than five million copies in 24 languages.         Her ''Gefängnistagebuch'' proved to be a particularly enduring success. First published in 1946, it appeared in the United States in 1987, under the title ''A Woman's Prison Journal: Germany 1944'' (Schocken).         When originally published, the book presented a rare -- and harrowing -- account of prison life in Nazi Germany from a woman's point of view. In a foreword, Ms. Rinser insisted that she was merely stating facts, but reviewers judged her vivid portraits of fellow inmates to be literature of a high order as well.         The other prisoners ranged from Jehovah's Witnesses to petty thieves, from discarded wives and mistresses to political prisoners. A political prisoner herself, she suffered separation from her two fatherless children and endured near starvation and constant abuse.         Another early work, ''Jan Lobel From Warsaw'' (1948), published in Britain in 1991, was among the earliest literary treatments of the Holocaust. Shunning pathos and psychological interpretations, the book sketches the lives of two women hiding a Polish Jew from the Nazis.         Luise Rinser was born in Pitzling, Bavaria. She studied psychology and pedagogy at the University of Munich and received a teacher's certificate in 1934.         She started writing while teaching grade school; her first book, ''Rings of Glass,'' a coming-of-age novel, was published in Berlin in 1941. It was a success, but her refusal to join the Nazi Party or any of its affiliates led to her ouster from the writers' guild in 1942.         A second edition of her book was blocked; she was under Schreibverbot, an edict forbidding her to write. She also had to resign her teaching position and was barred from public employment.         In 1934 Ms. Rinser married Horst Günther Schnell, an orchestra conductor, and they had two sons, Christoph and Stephan. Her husband died on the Russian front in 1942 while serving in a penitentiary unit.         A friend denounced Ms. Rinser as a traitor in 1944, and a Nazi tribunal found her guilty of high treason for interfering with the ability of the armed forces to fight. She was sent to a women's prison under a death sentence. The arrival of American soldiers at the war's end saved her life.         Among her most successful books were ''Daniela'' (1953), ''The Scapegoat'' (1954), ''The Middle of Life'' (1950), published as ''Nina'' by Regnery in 1956, ''Mirjam'' (1983) and ''Abelard's Love'' (1991), which was reissued by the University of Nebraska Press in 1996 and remains in print.         Often her public stands courted controversy, like her sympathy for the North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994.         She campaigned against militarism and the arms race as well as for abortion rights and Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik. In 1984 she was the Green Party candidate for president of West Germany, a hopeless campaign against the highly popular winner, Richard von Weizsäcker.         In 1953, her love of music led her into a second marriage, to the composer Carl Orff. They were divorced a few years later because, she said, the marriage stifled her creativity.         In her prison journal, Ms. Rinser wrote that she used the experience to rid herself of bourgeois perceptions. ''I have never seen life as I'm getting to see it here: naked, ugly, tough, but unfaked and real,'' she wrote. ''If ever I return to normal life I shall be transformed.''       
         Eileen Farrell, the American dramatic soprano who built a devoted following among the public through her frequent television appearances and was credited with the first successful crossover album, ''I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues,'' in 1960, died on Saturday in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 82.         She lived in Cliffside Park, N.J., but was taken to a nursing home in Park Ridge last week as circulatory ailments worsened.         From the start, Ms. Farrell was determined to have a singing career on her own terms. Her attitude exasperated many opera buffs, particularly Wagner fans, who heard in her enormous voice the Isolde and Brünnhilde of the future. She sang those roles tantalizingly in excerpted concert performances of ''Tristan und Isolde'' and ''Götterdämmerung'' with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein, but never sang them in the opera house.         Ms. Farrell's belated debut in opera came in 1956, when she appeared as Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' in Tampa, Fla. For her long-awaited Metropolitan Opera debut in 1960 she sang the title role of Gluck's ''Alceste'' in a new production. The ovation she received, with 22 curtain calls, created an ''ear-splitting din,'' said an account in The Saturday Review. But her association with the Met lasted only five years, and she was underutilized.         The problems stemmed partly from her chilly relationship with Rudolf Bing, the Met's autocratic general manager. Bing, who was never comfortable with easygoing American personalities, found Ms. Farrell's irreverence hard to deal with. Down-to-earth and plain-spoken, she liked hanging out with the stagehands and was fond of trading off-color jokes. She did not help herself by publicly dismissing the genre of opera in several interviews, once describing Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' as ''a real nothing.''         Tough and stout of frame, Ms. Farrell was comfortable with herself and confident onstage. But she was impatient with the pretentiousness of the opera world and never embraced it fully. Her work in popular music, radio and television also tainted her in the eyes of many impresarios, though today a singer with such media appeal would be prized by any opera company.         If Ms. Farrell never fulfilled her potential in opera, she had an important career as a recitalist and vocal soloist with orchestras. One of her lasting contributions to opera is the recording of a now-historic 1951 Carnegie Hall concert performance of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos, with Ms. Farrell as a searing Marie and Mack Harrell in the title role.         Ms. Farrell was renowned for the sheer size of her voice. Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times once remarked that Ms. Farrell, singing in Carnegie Hall, could probably be heard in downtown Newark. In his book ''The American Opera Singer,'' the critic Peter G. Davis recounts a story of Ms. Farrell's first performances with the powerhouse tenor Franco Corelli in ''La Forza del Destino'' in Philadelphia. After one duet, Mr. Corelli raced offstage shouting in Italian: ''Who is this woman? She has made me deaf!''         Though at full volume Ms. Farrell's voice could fill any opera house, her sound was never strident or forced. She could modulate her voice beautifully to float lovely pianissimos that still had a penetrating warmth and vibrancy. Her vocal technique was solid, complete with quite passable coloratura agility for bel canto roles like Queen Elizabeth in Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda,'' which she sings memorably opposite Beverly Sills in the title role on a recently reissued 1971 recording. When Ms. Farrell sang pop and jazz standards, she deftly adapted her voice, dipping into a contraltolike low register and bending phrases with smoky lyricism and clear, natural diction.         Ms. Farrell was born on Feb. 13, 1920, in Willimantic, Conn. Her parents were vaudeville performers, Catherine and Michael, the Singing O'Farrells, as they often called themselves. From them Ms. Farrell received her early musical training. Later she studied in New York with Merle Alcock, a Met contralto, and Eleanor McLellan, a vocal and opera coach. Her career began in 1940 when, just 20, she had her own weekly CBS radio program, ''Eileen Farrell Presents,'' in which she offered listeners a populist repertory of arias and light classical works with Irish ballads and Broadway standards mixed in.         The program lasted seven years, by which time Ms. Farrell's voice was one of the most recognized in the United States. All her life she prized a tape recording she had of herself and Frank Sinatra, in a guest appearance on her show, singing ''People Will Say We're in Love.''         In 1946 she married a New York police officer, Robert Reagan. He died in 1986. She is survived by their children, Robert Jr., of Boynton Beach, Fla., and Kathleen Reagan of Washington Township, N.J.; and her brother, John, of Newburyport, Mass.         The conductor Leopold Stokowski gave a boost to Ms. Farrell's classical career when, having heard her sing on radio, he invited her to record Wagner's ''Wesendonk'' lieder with him. Stokowski was on the podium when Ms. Farrell made her New York Philharmonic debut in 1949. In 1950 Mitropoulos, eager to reach audiences beyond Carnegie Hall, asked Ms. Farrell to join him for some concerts at the Roxy Theater, an old vaudeville house that had become a movie palace, singing programs of light classics and arias.         In the 1950's, when Ms. Farrell had all the concert engagements she could possibly want and was enjoying her regular work with the Bach Aria Group, a respected New York ensemble, she stumbled into one of her greatest popular successes: providing the singing voice for the actress Eleanor Parker in the 1955 film ''Interrupted Melody,'' the story of Marjorie Lawrence, the opera star, and her battle with cancer. The soundtrack covered repertory from Isolde's ''Liebestod'' to Butterfly's ''Un bel dì'' to ''Waltzing Matilda.'' A subsequent recording was a top seller.         The same year as her 1956 opera debut in Tampa, Ms. Farrell made her San Francisco Opera debut in ''Il Trovatore'' with Jussi Bjorling, returning in 1958 as Cherubini's ''Medea,'' a landmark performance of a work then little-known. After her Met debut she returned in ''La Gioconda,'' ''La Forza del Destino,'' ''Cavalleria'' and ''Andrea Chénier,'' the last with Mr. Corelli and Robert Merrill, one of Ms. Farrell's best pals at the Met, she used to say.         During these years, though, she continued to appear frequently on the television variety shows of Garry Moore, Jonathan Winters and Carol Burnett, among others. She would sing, chat and take part in sketches.         In the mid-1970's Ms. Farrell cut back on performing and began teaching classical and popular voice at Indiana State University.         Reflecting on her work in her 1999 autobiography, ''Can't Help Singing,'' written with Brian Kellow, a critic and the features editor of Opera News, Ms. Farrell wrote: ''In some ways I'm not sure I was suited to the career I had -- nothing in my background had really prepared me for how to handle it. I'm so grateful that most of the time I was able to keep it at arm's length.''         Correction:  March 26, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary of the dramatic soprano Eileen Farrell yesterday misidentified the university where she taught voice in the 1970's. It was Indiana University at Bloomington, not Indiana State.         The obituary also misstated the illness central to the plot of the film ''Interrupted Melody,'' in which Ms. Farrell provided the singing voice for the actress Eleanor Parker, as the soprano Marjorie Lawrence. The film depicted Ms. Lawrence's battle with polio, not cancer.         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of the dramatic soprano Eileen Farrell on Monday misstated the origin of the old Roxy Theater in New York, where she gave some concerts in 1950. It was built as a movie palace; it had not been a vaudeville house.       
         Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the enduringly popular grande dame of the British royal family and the country's most beloved symbol of courage and self-sacrifice during World War II, died in her sleep this afternoon at the Royal Lodge at Windsor Palace, a spokesman for her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, announced. She was 101.         In a life longer than the 20th century, the queen mother presided over a period of turbulence and change in Britain, helping to sustain the monarchy through the most serious crises to befall it in modern times.         In 1936, when her painfully diffident husband was crowned King George VI after the abdication of his older brother, she became the strength behind the throne, helping transform him from a stammering, insecure second son into a loved and respected monarch.         As queen during World War II, her decision to remain in London through the worst days of the blitz proved a rallying point for Britons desperate for the sort of leadership that only a monarch could provide. And when Buckingham Palace was bombed, she forever endeared herself to the nation by declaring herself in solidarity with the working-class people of London's bomb-ravaged East End.         ''I am almost glad we have been bombed,'' she said, in what became one of the war's most memorable remarks. ''Now I feel I can look the East End in the face.''         Many years later, through the traumas of the divorce and then the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, her granddaughter-in-law, the queen mother proved to be the royal family's most resiliently popular member, providing the country with a rock-steady reason for remaining a monarchy. News of her death today dealt a blow to Britons accustomed to her enduring presence. [Page 16.]         When King George died in 1952, she was thrust at the age of 51 into what would be the longest role of her life: that of the queen mother, necessarily taking a back seat to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. But in the eyes of a country that never lost its abiding affection for its good-natured ''Queen Mum,'' it was a role she fulfilled with grace, carrying out a grueling schedule of public engagements well into her 90's and never losing her common touch, which included a healthy appetite for a glass or two of gin and a love of horse racing and trout fishing.         ''She is the nation's favorite great-grandmother, seemingly known intimately to all of us for years,'' The Times of London declared in 1985, on the occasion of the queen mother's 85th birthday (she celebrated it by flying on the Concorde). ''She has helped make the royal family more secure in the nation's affections than it has been at any other time in history.''         Ben Pimlott, the historian and royal biographer, wrote in 1997 that the queen mother was ''the last survivor of the tiny club of center-stage actors of the Second World War.'' He continued: ''She has also shown a chameleon-like ability to adapt to shifting conditions, something her deeply conservative nature makes the more remarkable. Unlike most public figures, she does not date. She has never made an intellectual remark in her life. Her knack has been to look for the best in people and offer a kind of looking glass to the virtues they would like to have.''         Father Was an Eccentric         Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was born in London on Aug. 4, 1900, in the waning days of the reign of Queen Victoria, a golden time for the British monarchy and its empire. She was the fourth daughter and ninth child of Lord Glamis, a Scottish nobleman whose family occupied Glamis Castle in Scotland, said to be the place where Macbeth murdered Duncan in Shakespeare's play. When his father died four years later, Lord Glamis inherited a considerable fortune and an even more impressive title, becoming the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis.         Lord Strathmore was a bona fide aristocratic eccentric. He had a deep mistrust of eggs (''Poison, my dear, poison,'' he would intone ominously at the breakfast table) and a habit of dragging dead branches from his woods in the middle of the night. Dressed in an old raincoat tied with string, he would then split them into logs for the fire.         Raised partly at Glamis and partly in the fashionable Knightsbridge section of London, the young Lady Elizabeth was by all accounts sunny almost to a fault. Her favorite hobby, she once wrote in an autograph album, was ''making friends.''         Indifferently educated by governesses, Elizabeth spent much of her youth doing what young aristocratic women generally did at the time: learning arts like household management and enjoying herself. The real world intruded during World War I, though, when her brothers went off to fight and Glamis was turned for four years into a convalescent home for soldiers. Wanting to protect her mother from bad news, Elizabeth made sure to waylay the mailman every morning so that she could read the mail first. In fact, there was bad news: one of Elizabeth's brothers was killed, sending Lady Strathmore into a depression from which she never really recovered.         When the war was over, Elizabeth's social life, essentially an extended search for a husband in the guise of a series of amusing diversions, began in earnest. Her biographers tend to agree that she was a great success as a debutante, flirting wildly and constantly fending off a large coterie of broken-hearted suitors, one of whom reportedly -- and unromantically -- serenaded her by cracking his hunting whip under her bedroom window at night.         Elizabeth and Bertie         Although history is hazy on facts, several biographers say there was one suitor whom Elizabeth was genuinely in love with: Maj. James Stuart, the equerry to Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, the Duke of York and King George V's second son. But if there was a romance there, it never went anywhere. Albert began courting Elizabeth himself, and Major Stuart ended up being summarily shipped off to work on an oil rig in Oklahoma. The day before Elizabeth's wedding, he announced his own engagement to one of her friends.         The romance between Elizabeth and Bertie, as the prince was known, apparently did not begin promisingly. Bullied by his parents and overshadowed by his handsome and charming older brother, David, the Prince of Wales, Bertie suffered from delicate health, crippling shyness, an array of nervous tics, a terrible stutter, an unpredictable temper, a tendency to melancholy and what today would be described as a serious case of low self-esteem. When he asked his parents' permission to pursue Elizabeth, his father murmured, ''You'll be a lucky fellow if she accepts you.''         Elizabeth did resist Bertie's attentions for several years, finally accepting his proposal in 1923 and thus agreeing to become the first commoner (anyone below the rank of peer or peeress) to marry so close to the throne since the 17th century. It was when her engagement was announced that Lady Elizabeth had her first and only on-the-record conversation with a reporter. The interview was harmless enough -- ''I play golf, badly, and I am fond of lawn tennis,'' she confided -- but she was roundly rebuked by the king, and never gave another interview.         The wedding was a national extravaganza, but afterward Elizabeth, now the Duchess of York, settled in relatively modest circumstances, at least by royal standards. Though the house she shared with Bertie at 145 Piccadilly, London, had 25 bedrooms and 21 servants, it was hardly a palace, and it opened onto a communal garden at the back. They had two children, Elizabeth, known as Lilibet, and Margaret Rose, and the Duchess settled into a pleasant life of regal domesticity, saying her main duty was ''bringing up her children.''         Another duty was bucking up the flagging spirits of her husband, who hated the spotlight but who was required to make many public appearances, particularly as his father's health waned and his older brother proved more interested in a racy social life than in boring regal duties. But while in many ways the personalities of the Yorks could not have been more different -- she was ebullient where he was glum, relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was laconic -- they were surprisingly well suited.         Among other things, Elizabeth forced Bertie to seek treatment for what was delicately referred to as his ''affliction,'' and the two visited a Harley Street doctor nearly every day for some two and a half months, as Bertie learned to keep his stutter in check. The marriage proved to be just what the future king needed, Bertie's official biographer, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, would later write. ''It brought him much for which he had long craved in deprivation -- love, understanding, sympathy, support,'' he said. ''All these things were now his in generous abundance, and his whole conspectus of life changed accordingly.''         Edward and Mrs. Simpson         The coziness of their early years was abruptly shattered in 1936, when King Edward VIII, as Bertie's older brother styled himself on ascending the throne, announced that he had fallen inconveniently in love with the very married Wallis Simpson, an American whose earlier divorce from her first husband had already ruled her out as a possible royal bride.         Not even the exhortations of his most trusted advisers, or the frightened tears of his younger brother, would make Edward give up Mrs. Simpson, and on Dec. 10, 1936, he abdicated and left for France. Mrs. Simpson got a divorce in 1937, and the two eventually married, adopted a flotilla of small dogs, and spent the rest of their lives in glamorous if bitter exile as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         The terrified Bertie was left behind to comfort a shocked nation and to try to rise to the occasion. ''Dickie, this is absolutely terrible,'' he told his friend and cousin Lord Mountbatten. ''I'm quite unprepared for it. David has been trained for this all his life. I've never even seen a state paper.'' It was clear, even then, how much he depended on Elizabeth. ''With my wife and helpmeet by my side, I take up the heavy burden which lies before me,'' he said on his first day as king.         Elizabeth may have seemed complaisant and sweet, but she had a ''steel hand within a velvet glove,'' in the words of Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, and she never forgave David or Wallis Simpson for throwing her husband to the wolves. ''She can forgive any act but treachery, and then she is implacable as any Scot,'' wrote Dorothy Laird, one of Elizabeth's biographers. ''The wound goes very deep.'' Most of her anger, it seems, was directed against the duchess.         Bertie himself was so unnerved that he never mentioned Wallis's name, referring to her in his diary as ''Mrs. S.,'' but the queen certainly had a hand in ensuring that she and her brother-in-law had as rough a time as possible. On the eve of their wedding and in a move that foreshadowed the battle over a post-divorce title for Diana, the Princess of Wales, more than 50 years later, the couple were informed that while the duke would continue to be styled ''royal highness,'' the duchess would not. The wedding was a tiny, fraught affair, with only 12 guests, none from David's family.         Acutely sensitive to what they saw as the duke's efforts to set up an unofficial rival court, the king and queen continually thwarted David's efforts to return home with Wallis. It was not until 30 years later, with Bertie long dead, that Elizabeth was to come face to face again with her hated sister-in-law, whom she always called in private ''the woman who killed my husband.'' (Wallis was not particularly fond of her, either, referring to her as ''Cookie'' in a disparaging reference to her plumpness.)         The crisis having been weathered, the new king and queen set out to remove some of the stuffiness from royal life, dispensing, for instance, with the custom of requiring the king's daughters to curtsy to him. But they would soon find other matters preoccupying them, as the country became consumed with the specter of impending war. The king tried valiantly, if ineffectually, to do his part for diplomacy, preparing a personal letter to Hitler in 1938 that appealed to him ''as one ex-serviceman to another'' and begged him to spare the world from another war. (In the end, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, sternly if gently forbade the King to send the letter.)         The King and the President         Early in 1939, Elizabeth and Bertie traveled to Hyde Park, N.Y., to visit Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, the president and first lady of the United States. The trip, in which they had their first taste of hot dogs, cemented a friendship that was to prove helpful in obtaining American support for the war effort later. In her memoirs, Mrs. Roosevelt described the easy banter between the king and the president.         ''My mother does not approve of cocktails and thinks you should have a cup of tea,'' Roosevelt said. ''Neither does my mother,'' the king replied. Then they both had cocktails.         War broke out in August, when Hitler invaded Poland, and Elizabeth was formally advised by the British cabinet to take her daughters to Canada until the danger was past. She refused to go, stoutly declaring that ''the princesses would never leave without me, and I wouldn't leave without the king, and the king will never leave.'' Instead, she remained in London, enthusiastically taking target practice at the palace with a revolver that was a gift from the new prime minister, Winston Churchill.         The royal family's role in wartime was a largely ceremonial one -- visiting Red Cross centers, civil defense installations, air-raid shelters, hospitals and munition factories; comforting the wounded, and boosting the morale of soldier and civilian alike --but the importance of such ceremony at such a time cannot be overstated.         ''Your majesty, don't you know what you mean to all of us in this country?'' the minister of food at the time, Lord Woolton, once said to Elizabeth. ''It isn't only your high position that matters; it is the fact that the vast majority of people think of you as a person who would speak the kindly word, and, if it fell within your power, would take the cup of hot soup to the needy person.''         Though the king made secret visits to the troops and Elizabeth made a point of visiting places that had been bombed, invariably wearing a smart dress and pearls, they were relatively unaffected personally until Sept. 13, 1940. That day, as the royal couple sat in one of their living rooms at Buckingham Palace, the palace was struck by half a dozen German bombs, which damaged its courtyard and destroyed its chapel. Although they were able to take refuge in an unusually upscale bomb shelter, prepared by the queen with handsome furniture and a supply of fashion magazines, it was then that the queen made her enduring remark about being able ''to look the East End in the eye.''         In a biography of Elizabeth, the royal writer Anthony Holden called it ''a phrase which will reverberate through the history of the British monarchy's relations with its people.'' He continued, ''Never before, or indeed since, had such a strength of fellow-feeling been so genuine and so widely shared.''         A Spartan Windsor Castle         The queen also made it clear that she was determined to adhere to strict rules of wartime economy. Although the royal family's life was naturally easier than that of most of her countrymen, it was still rigorously ascetic. Windsor Castle, where Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were to spend the next five years, had no heat except for the occasional space heater, and just one bare bulb for each room.         When Mrs. Roosevelt visited Buckingham Palace in 1942, she found a bathtub painted with a black line above which water was not supposed to rise; food that was close to inedible (and severely rationed) and rooms that were so cold that the women wore fur coats and blankets indoors.         Not even Churchill escaped. Accustomed to eating meager sandwiches served by the queen during his weekly luncheon meetings with the king, he found on one occasion that the food was even more horrific than usual. ''I don't know what is in these sandwiches,'' the king told the prime minister. ''Sawdust, I suppose.''         The king's always fragile health was not improved by the stresses of the war or by his lifelong smoking habit, and after victory was declared in 1945, he began the long, slow decline that would result in his death, from lung cancer, in 1952. With the death of her husband, Elizabeth had to face the fact that she was no longer on center stage, would have to leave Buckingham Palace, and would, if protocol was strictly followed, have to curtsy to her own daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Riven with grief, she wrote to President Eisenhower that ''one cannot imagine life without him, but one must carry on as he would have wished.''         In the past, widowed mothers of monarchs were known as queen dowagers, but Elizabeth rejected that title in favor of the more impressive one she held to her death: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. As queen mother, she lost neither her formidability nor her ability to influence. The new queen was just 25 when she ascended the throne, and relied heavily on the advice of her mother. The operators at Clarence House, which became the queen mother's official residence, soon became used to putting through her daughter's daily telephone call: ''Your majesty?'' they would say, ''I have her majesty on the line, your majesty.''         Another Divorce Crisis         Soon afterward, another crisis befell the monarchy when Princess Margaret, the queen mother's younger daughter, fell in love with a divorced man, Peter Townsend, a hero of the Battle of Britain. It is unclear what role her mother played in the queen's decision to inform Margaret that she would have to give up her royal status and leave the country if she married Mr. Townsend, but the lessons of Edward's abdication were surely not lost to her now. The princess gave up her beau, married the photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones five years later, and ended up divorcing him 15 years after that. Margaret died on Feb. 9, predeceasing her mother by less than two months.         Bolstered by a large staff, a number of houses at her disposal, and an allowance of more than $1 million a year from Parliament, the queen mother kept up a busy schedule that began to ease up only when she was in her 80's. She served as either president or patron of 312 British organizations, ranging, as one biographer put it, ''from the Royal Agricultural Society to the Dachshund Club.'' As a link to the past, a symbol of continuity, and, to many, a potent reminder of Britain's finest hour, the she remained a familiar figure even in her late 90's, in her cheerful, brightly colored dresses, large flowery hats and ready smile.         Her health problems over the years always became a cause for concern in a country that simply did not want her to die. She had two hip-replacement operations in her late 90's, which invariably ended with her hobbling slowly out of the hospital while crowds of well-wishers cheered. What the public did not learn, until it was finally reported by the news media much later, was that she underwent a colostomy in 1966 and had to wear a bag to collect her wastes for the rest of her life.         In recent years, there were niggling criticisms of the queen mother: that she was a bon vivant who spent far beyond her means; that she kept too many houses and employed too many servants and generally thought too much of her own comfort. But such sniping was relatively muted.         She remained popular because, in a very different and much more real way than Diana had been, she was a monarch who never lost the common touch. Nor did she lose her rather sly, flirtatious smile, her beguiling manner (''I work awfully hard, but Mummy has all the charm,'' her daughter Elizabeth once said) or her easy way with the public.         Reveling in meeting and chatting to new people (''If we do not pass on, I shall soon pass out,'' her husband once said as Elizabeth persisted in chatting at a public appearance), she was also eternally tactful and diplomatic. At a luncheon on a trip to South Africa, she once listened patiently as an irate Afrikaaner mayor complained about the indignities his countrymen had suffered at the hands of the English. ''Oh, I do understand so well,'' Elizabeth responded. ''That's just how we feel about them in Scotland.''         And once, after touring a garden in London, she stayed on for tea. ''I hear you like gin?'' her hostess blurted out, instantly afraid of appearing tactless. But the queen mother thought it delightful.         ''I hadn't realized I enjoyed that reputation,'' she replied. ''But as I do, perhaps you could make it a large one.''         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother yesterday misstated the name of the royal estate where she died. It is Windsor Castle, not Windsor Palace.         Correction:  April 3, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on Sunday misstated the date of Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, which prompted the cabinet to suggest that she take her daughters to Canada. It was Sept. 1, not in August.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a  golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.       
         Esther Afua Ocloo, who as a young woman turned a gift of less than a dollar into 12 jars of marmalade -- which she sold for a profit -- and went on to become one of Ghana's leading entrepreneurs and a prominent exponent of the role of women in economic development, died on Feb. 8 in Accra, Ghana. She was 83.         Her husband, Stephen, said she  died of pneumonia in Accra Military Hospital.         As the first chairwoman of Women's World Banking, Ms. Ocloo was one of the pioneers of microlending, the financing of homespun businesses, predominantly run by women, through very small loans, sometimes as little as $50. If a business prospers and the loan is repaid -- as more than 98 percent are -- then a larger loan is made available.         Large lending institutions give microlending institutions, like Women's World Banking, big loans of, say, $5 million. The money is then parceled out in small loans, at interest rates slightly higher than normal commercial bank rates, for enterprises as simple as drying fish.         Nancy Barry, president of Women's World Banking, said that 25 million people, three-quarters of them women, had received microloans in more than 40 less-developed countries. Half the loans are from Women's World Banking.         The idea was born at the 1975 Mexico City conference that proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Women. Ms. Ocloo found that ideas she had been developing with women in Ghana were also percolating elsewhere. The premise was simple: more than education, health care or family planning, women in poor countries need money in their pockets.         The other early leaders in the movement were Michaela Walsh, a New York investment banker, and Ela Bhatt, founder of a cooperative bank for illiterate women in India. They and several allies founded Women's World Banking in 1979 with Ms. Ocloo as chairwoman.         Ms. Barry said that concentrating on women made sense because they are discriminated against in borrowing; they do the majority of artisanal work and much of the farming, and they have a keener sense of the interdependence of generations.         Ms. Ocloo, in a speech in 1990, gave a starkly practical explanation.         ''Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power,'' she said. ''You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do.''         Esther Afua Nkulenu was born in  Peki-Dzake in the Volta region of Ghana on April 18, 1919. Her parents were poor farmers, but she was able to attend high school with the help of scholarships offered to young women by Cadbury, the chocolate company, which was a major buyer of Ghana's cocoa crop.         Her mother, with tears in her eyes, sent her off to Accra with just a sixpence. After graduating, she lived with relatives in the city. An aunt gave her 10 shillings, worth less than one United States dollar. She bought sugar, firewood, oranges and 12 jars, and made marmalade jam, which she sold for a shilling a jar.         ''I was ridiculed by all my classmates, who saw me hawking marmalade on the street like an uneducated street vendor,'' rather than seeking an office job, she said.         But she plowed her profits back into the business. She also took some of her marmalade to her old high school and won a contract to supply the entire school. Soon, school officials asked her to supply orange juice from orange trees on its grounds.         She next got a contract to supply juice to the military, but lacked the necessary funds to produce it. Though she had no collateral, she persuaded a bank to give her a loan on the basis of the contract. The result was her company, Nkulenu Industries, which grew to produce products like canned tomatoes and soup bases.         After six years, she had saved enough money to go to Britain to study food technology, preservation, nutrition and agriculture. She also learned leatherwork and lampshade-making in the hope of sharing the skills with rural women back home.         Even as she continued running her own company upon her return, she devoted more and more of her time to improving women's economic situation. For example, she established her own program on a farm to train women in agriculture, preparing and preserving food products and making handicrafts.         She paid for the program in part with her half of the Africa Prize, a $100,000 award she split with Olusegun Obasanjo, the current president of Nigeria, in 1990. It was presented by the Hunger Project for their leadership in working to end hunger in Africa.         She liked to keep things simple, as when she taught business management skills to women involved in cooking and selling food on the streets.         ''I have taught them to cost the things they sell and determine their profits,'' she said. ''You know what we found? We found that a woman selling rice and stew on the side of the street is making more money than most women in office jobs -- but they are not taken seriously.''         Ms. Ocloo, who always wore bright African clothes and loved to cook traditional meals, preferred to be known as Auntie Ocloo, in the Ghanaian tradition. She usually began meetings of bankers and others with a prayer, and often ended them with a song: ''We Are Wonderful.''         The day she entered the hospital she gave a speech urging women to carry on her campaign for micro-lending. Days before she died, she was on the phone from her hospital bed to governmental officials arguing that microloans, rather than grants, should be specified in Ghana's new budget.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Georgina Nkulenu; her daughter, Vincentia Canacco; her sons Vincent Malm, Christian Biassey and Stephen Jr., and six grandchildren.         She once said her children complained that the women she trained competed against her.         ''I don't listen,'' she said. ''My main goal is to help my fellow women. If they make better marmalade than me, I deserve the competition.''       
         Linda Boreman, the woman once known as Linda Lovelace, who starred in one of the first feature-length pornography movies, ''Deep Throat,'' and who later denounced it as depicting her ''rape,'' died on Monday in Denver. She was 53.         The cause was injuries from a car accident on April 3, her family said.         The 62-minute film, released in 1972, made money so fast that its producers joked they had to weigh their receipts each day; by many estimates it earned more than $600 million. It cost just $30,000 to make, according to Variety. Ms. Boreman said she was paid nothing.         ''Deep Throat'' and Linda Lovelace became household words and figured in three dozen books and 18 published songs. During Watergate, Washington Post reporters called their secret source Deep Throat.         But Ms. Boreman testified about the dangers of pornography before Congress, courts and city councils in the 1980's, and became a poster child for feminists like Gloria Steinem, who wrote an introduction to her 1986 book with Mike McGrady, ''Out of Bondage.''         Ms. Boreman insisted that she had made the movie only because her husband at the time, Chuck Traynor, threatened her with violence. ''I knew the feeling of a gun to my back and hearing the click, never knowing when there was going to be a real bullet,'' she said in her 1980 autobiography, ''Ordeal,'' written with Mr. McGrady.         Linda Boreman was born in the Bronx on Jan. 10, 1949, and moved to Yonkers when she was 3. Her father was a police officer, and her mother held Tupperware parties.         ''How does she do it?'' Vincent Canby asked in an article in The New York Times. ''The film has less to do with the manifold pleasures of sex than with physical engineering.''         She told of literally escaping from Mr. Traynor, who was already seeing his second wife, Marilyn Chambers, another pornography star. She hid out in different hotels for weeks, then began appearing in Las Vegas and London in skimpy costumes, drawing a smattering of publicity. The movie career for which she had hoped never materialized.         She later married Larry Marchiano. They divorced in 1996. She is survived by their children, a daughter, Lindsay, and a son, Dominic; a sister, Barbara Boreman; and three grandchildren.         The family lived on welfare when Mr. Marchiano was unemployed, and Ms. Boreman had a liver transplant in 1987. After they moved to Denver in 1990, she worked at low-paying jobs.         In recent years, she enjoyed the reception she received at memorabilia shows, said Eric Danville, author of ''The Complete Linda Lovelace'' (Power Process Publishing, 2001). ''People would tell her how much they loved her 100 times a day,'' he said.         Mr. Danville also recalled watching ''Deep Throat'' with her nine months ago. It was the first time she had seen it from start to finish.         ''I don't see what the big deal was,'' she said.       
         Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, who emerged as a popular, prolific writer of keenly observed nonfiction with a 1978 book about the dozen years she spent as a Jehovah's Witness, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 67 and lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her daughter, Anna Harrison. She once wrote that for years she smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.         The turning point in her life and career was her decision, at 22, to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade a college education. What followed was a successful self-education and a blossoming into a multifaceted writer of literate travel books, many essays and reviews, and a novel.         With ''Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Simon & Schuster), she became nationally known; her later work, mostly nonfiction, usually received excellent reviews.         In The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick said ''Visions of Glory'' was ''quite well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the personality of its author is extremely appealing.''         Ms. Harrison was converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses faith by her mother when she was 9; she went door to door carrying its message. At 19, she went to live and work at its world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights.         After three years there, she renounced the faith and left.         ''Visions of Glory'' mixes her autobiography with detailed historical research. She portrays the religion as racist, sexist and totalitarian, but also details members' kindness to one another, their care for the elderly and their courage in the face of persecution.         Barbara Grizzuti was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 14, 1934. She grew up in various Brooklyn neighborhoods, mainly Bensonhurst. Her father, a printer, and her brother, Richard, did not become Jehovah's Witnesses, creating a deep fault line in the household. She wrote of an extremely disorganized family, and of a father who sexually abused her and once tried to kill her.         As a young teenager, Barbara already knew she wanted to be a writer. When asked in an interview in ''Contemporary Authors'' how she could reconcile this ambition with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses, she suggested that the religion's images of the watery creation of the world and its imminent bloody destruction stimulated her imagination.         ''I think the two things were going on simultaneously: the religion encouraged something it was bound to squash,'' she said.         In her autobiography, ''An Accidental Autobiography'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), she wrote, ''I read Sartre in my late teens and made the mistake of taking him seriously.''         After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, she moved to the East Village and worked as a secretary at a publishing house and at the American Committee on Africa. There she met W. Dale Harrison, whom she married. He took a job with CARE, and they lived in Libya, India and Guatemala.         They returned to Brooklyn with their two children, and she wrote that she thought of herself as ''one of those furtive, silly housewives with a novel under her apron.''         Her first book, ''Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School'' (Liveright, 1969), grew out of the children's experiences with efforts to quell sexism at what was then the Woodward Park School in Brooklyn.         The Harrisons divorced in 1968 after eight years of marriage.         Ms. Harrison was an early writer for Ms. Magazine. Often described as a gifted interviewer, she contributed to many other national magazines and newspapers. She was noted for her humor and her strong opinions; she once called the highly regarded novelist Joan Didion a ''neurasthenic Cher.''         Her other books included ''Italian Days'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989), an impressionistic and literary travel book about Italy that won the American Book Award, and a novel, ''Foreign Bodies'' (Doubleday, 1984).         Ms. Harrison is survived by her daughter, who lives in Bethlehem, Conn., and her son, Josh Harrison of Manhattan.         Her daughter said her mother returned to the religion of her early childhood, Roman Catholicism, in her 40's, partly as a result of interviewing Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and partly because she hoped to meet in heaven the high school English teacher who had first appreciated her writing.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Indra Devi, the daughter of European nobility who introduced the ancient discipline of yoga to the Kremlin leadership, Hollywood stars like Gloria Swanson and even students in India, died on Thursday in Buenos Aires. She was 102.         In Buenos Aires, where she had lived for several years, she formed a yoga foundation that was named after her.         Known to her followers as Mataji, which means mother, she was a student of Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, the legendary guru who gained worldwide attention for stopping his heartbeat for two minutes. At a time when yoga was almost an exclusively masculine pursuit, she was his first female student.         Like two of his other students, B.K.S. Ayengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, both men, she took his essential teachings and built a style of yoga accessible to Westerners. It was characterized by gentleness.         ''She herself became a kind of seminal figure,'' said Phil Catalto, a senior editor of Yoga Journal. ''She was an ambassador of yoga.''         She was born Eugenie Peterson in Riga, Latvia, on May 12, 1899. Her father was a Swedish bank director, and her mother was a Russian noblewoman. She attended drama school in Moscow as a girl, and escaped to Berlin with her mother when the Communists came to power in 1917.         In Berlin, she became an actress and dancer. Her fascination with India began at 15, when she read a book by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, then some books on yoga. In 1927, she sailed for India.         Under the stage name Indra Devi, she became a rising star in Indian films. In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, commercial attaché to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Bombay. Through him, she met the Maharaja and Maharini of Mysore, who maintained a yoga school in their palace where Sri Krishnamacharya taught.         She asked the master for a lesson. He refused, on the grounds that she was a Westerner and a woman. But she persuaded the royal couple to prevail upon the guru, and he reluctantly consented, said Fernando Pages Ruiz, a freelance writer who interviewed her.         Rather than the cursory lessons he had at first intended, Sri Krishnamacharya taught her for a year. When he learned that her husband was to be transferred to China, he trained her to be a yoga teacher.         In Shanghai, she taught what was thought to be the first yoga class in modern China, Mr. Ruiz said. Her husband, she said in a 1996 interview in Yoga Journal, was ''dead set against'' her yoga courses. It was also the time of the Japanese occupation.         For a time she held five classes of 25 students a day in the bedroom of Madame Chiang Kaishek, wife of the nationalist leader and a new yoga enthusiast.         After the war, she returned to India and wrote her first book, believed to be the first book on yoga written by a Westerner to be published in India. She also became known as the first Westerner to teach yoga there.         Her husband, meanwhile, had been ordered back to Czechoslovakia, where he died in 1946.         She returned to Shanghai to recover their belongings and was unsure whether to go to India or the United States. She bought tickets for both destinations and resolved to take whichever ship sailed first. America won.         She found her way to Hollywood, arriving in January 1947. She discovered ready students among movie stars, who found yoga's breathing and relaxation techniques useful to their work. Her students included Miss Swanson, to whom she dedicated one of her 12 books, Robert Ryan, Greta Garbo, Jennifer Jones and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin.         She taught yoga for at Elizabeth Arden's spas in Maine and Arizona, but refused to join the staff.         In 1953, she married Dr. Siegrid Knauer, who preferred preventive medicine to antibiotics. After becoming an American citizen, she legally changed her name to Indra Devi.         Dr. Knauer bought her a 24-room estate in Tecate, Mexico, at which to give training courses for yoga teachers. He died in 1977.         In 1960, India's ambassador to Moscow arranged for her to meet the top Soviet leaders, including Aleksei Kosygin, the premier, Andrei Gromyko, the foreign minister, and Anastas Mikoyan, chairman of the Supreme Soviet. After she spoke to them of the benefits of yoga, it was legalized in Russia.         In 1966, she became captivated by the teachings of the guru Satya Sai Baba. This resulted in a new form of yoga that she called Sai Yoga.         She traveled and taught around the world. In 1982, she visited Argentina, where her popularity snowballed after a single television appearance. She formed a foundation to spread her yoga methods. At the time of her death, it operated six studios.         ''She was like a national treasure,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''It wasn't just yoga, she was known by the population at large.''         She had no children by either marriage. A woman at her foundation who identified herself only as Anna said that she had an adopted daughter named Rosita.       
         María Félix, the Mexican film star whose extraordinary beauty and force of personality made her a living myth to Mexicans and a symbol of glamour and sophistication to fans throughout the world, died yesterday at her home in Mexico City. She was 87.         Ms. Félix made 47 films during a tumultuous film career that began with overnight stardom in the early 1940's and raged on for three decades. During the entire period, she reigned as the supreme goddess of Spanish-language cinema.         Ms. Félix made films in Mexico, Spain, Italy, France and Argentina, portraying figures like a belly dancer, a brothel keeper, a teacher, a soldier, a cabaret singer and a man-eating Roman empress. She was cast so often as a notorious or strong-minded woman that those characteristics became indistinguishable from her own tempestuous personality in the minds of many fans, especially after the success of early films with titles like ''Woman Without a Soul.''         She did not speak English and never accepted work in Hollywood, where directors offered her only stereotyped parts as a Latin spitfire.         She married four times, divorcing her first husband, a cosmetics salesman, and her second, Agustín Lara, who was Mexico's greatest songwriter. She was widowed by her third husband, Jorge Negrete, the country's leading male star, and by her last, Alex Berger, a French financier.         ''Many feminine images have ignited the fantasy of the Mexicans,'' wrote Octavio Paz, Mexico's Nobel Prize-winning poet, in a 1992 essay on cinema and myth-making. Some, he said, like the Virgen de Guadalupe, are sweet, maternal figures, and others, like the Malinche, Cortés's indigenous concubine, are inscrutable.         ''But the myth of María Félix is different,'' Mr. Paz declared. ''María Félix is a woman -- such a woman -- with the audacity to defy the ideas machos have constructed of what a woman should be. She's free like the wind, she disperses the clouds, or illuminates them with the lightning flash of her gaze.''         Ms. Félix's best movies were filmed in the 1940's, when she was a dominant figure in the golden age of Mexican cinema. She became so powerful that she exerted great influence over lighting, camera angles, scenario, wardrobe and other aspects of films usually reserved for producers and directors. In Europe and in Mexico during the 1950's, she worked with eminent European directors like Jean Renoir and Luis Buñuel and leading men like Gérard Philipe and Yves Montand.         Ms. Félix was born María de los Ángeles Félix Guereña, on May 4, 1914, in Álamos, Sonora, according to the birth certificate discovered by Paco Ignacio Taibo, the author of ''La Doña,'' a 1985 biography of Ms. Félix (Mexico City: Planeta).         Her father, Bernardo Félix, was a merchant turned civil servant and an imperious dictator over his middle-class household. Ms. Félix described him in 1993 interviews with Enrique Krauze, the Mexican historian, as a classic macho who hid his emotions, beat his sons and ignored his daughters. Her mother, Josefina Guereña, bore 16 children, of which 12 survived. María was the ninth.         When Ms. Félix was about 10, her family moved to Guadalajara, where she was expelled from several schools. But she made it to the university, where she was elected Queen of the Carnival. Enrique Álvarez, a traveling salesman proposed to her after demonstrating his Max Factor cosmetics to her, and she agreed to marry him. Her only son, Enrique Álvarez Félix, was born in 1934 when she was not quite 20. He died in 1996.         Her husband was jealous and rough. Ms. Félix became unhappy, and after a brief affair with a college student, obtained a divorce.         After she moved to Mexico City, a minor film director, Fernando Palacios, saw her on the street, persuaded her to consider acting, and helped her obtain her first part, in the 1942 film ''El Peñón de las Ánimas,'' or ''The Rock of the Spirits,'' a rural melodrama modeled loosely on ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Critics have lampooned the movie over the years for its histrionics; in its climactic scene, Ms. Félix is shot and hurled from the top of a tall pine. But the part immediately thrust Ms. Félix to the summit of Mexican cinema.         ''This was the appearance of a personality who had nothing to do with the rest of Mexican cinema,'' Mr. Taibo wrote in his biography. ''María was not only a singular beauty. She had a lofty bearing that stood in complete contrast to the traditionally submissive Mexican actress.''         In the years that remained in the decade, Ms. Félix filmed 19 movies that include her classic portrayals.         ''Enamorada,'' filmed in 1946, was the first of several in which she was teamed with the director Emilio Fernández and the cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, and which critics have judged her best work. In the film, a romantic comedy, Ms. Félix played the daughter of a wealthy patriarch in a Mexican town seized by revolutionary troops. The occupying general, who falls in love with her, was played by Pedro Armendáriz, a dashing Mexican star.         Ms. Félix never studied acting in any formal sense, but improvised her own approach to movie parts and to the cameraman's lens. ''She was never interested in a realistic style of acting,'' said Manuel Puig, the Argentine author, in 1990. ''Instead, she worked out a highly personal way of moving and talking.''         Adding to Ms. Félix's mythic stature was a romantic life that brought marriage or liaison with many leading men of her era and courtship by numerous powerful but eventually disappointed pretenders.         In 1943 she married Mr. Lara, Mexico's national musician-poet, a sensational union that drove newspapers wild, especially after Mr. Lara wrote Ms. Félix a song, ''María Bonita,'' or ''Pretty Maria,'' which became fabulously popular. The marriage was to Mexicans what Marilyn Monroe's marriage to Joe DiMaggio was to Americans.         But the marriage began to chafe under Mr. Lara's jealous eye. They divorced in 1947, and she traveled to Spain to film her first European movie, ''Mare Nostrum,'' in which she played a Latin Mata Hari.         Mr. Lara was only one of dozens of eminent men who fell in love with Ms. Félix, some ridiculously.         The artist Diego Rivera became so obsessed that he dedicated an entire period to painting her portraits. One, in which he dressed her in a sheer white gown revealing her silky figure, he titled ''Very Bad.'' A photo of the two at the time shows him, fat and froglike, embracing her as she, looking cool and gorgeous, stares away in bemused boredom.         ''He threw himself on me like misery throws itself on the poor,'' Ms. Félix recalled later.         Ms. Félix first met Mr. Negrete, who would be her third husband, filming ''The Rock of the Spirits.'' Their 1952 wedding was a national event, but the marriage was shortlived. Mr. Negrete's health was failing, and Ms. Félix, called again to film in Europe, left him behind. When word came that Mr. Negrete was stricken in Hollywood, she flew 36 hours west to his bedside, and accompanied his coffin back to Mexico City, where a line of mourners 10 miles long were waiting.         Starting in 1948 Ms. Félix began a love affair with Europe, filming six straight films in Spain, France and Italy, and a seventh in Argentina.         Blocked from a Hollywood career by her inability to speak English, Ms. Félix was determined to make movies in France. She devoted eight hours a day to studying French, putting a pencil under her tongue to practice her pronunciation.         Her French movies included ''La Belle Otero,'' directed by Richard Pottier in 1954, in which she played a turn-of-the-century courtesan, and ''French Cancan,'' directed by Jean Renoir later that same year.         Her last movie, ''La Generala,'' in which she played the sister of a rebel general who takes up arms when she sees the revolution betrayed, was released in 1970.         One of Ms. Félix's longest and most disagreeable conflicts involved Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican writer, who modeled the main character of a 1967 novel, ''Zona Sagrada'', on Ms. Félix, portraying her as a pathetic egomaniac. Fifteen years later, Mr. Fuentes again publicly dissected Ms. Félix's personality, along with that of another major Mexican actress, Dolores del Rio, in a play, ''Orchids in the Moonlight.''         Ms. Félix was bitter. ''Not only did he steal my soul in his novel, but he also attacked me and Dolores del Rio in his play,'' she told an interviewer from Vanity Fair magazine in 1990.         ''María has a mythic quality, and she's a great national symbol,'' Mr. Fuentes responded. ''That's why I could dare to have a character impersonate her: only a myth can inspire imitation.''         Yesterday, in learning of her death, Mr. Fuentes said: ''She was a goddess. There were no eyes in the world more beautiful than María Félix's. She was a magnificent character, and, along with Dolores del Rio, the greatest beauty of the golden age of the Mexican cinema.''       
         Dorothy Love Coates, a gospel singer whose gruff delivery and blazing theatrics made her one of the giants of the genre, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., where she lived most of her life. She was 74.         The cause was heart disease, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and gospel music scholar.         Ms. Coates's voice was rough and gravelly, and did not have the range or sweetness of Mahalia Jackson, Marion Williams and other leading gospel singers of her day.         But what Ms. Coates lacked in vocal purity she more than made up for in her impassioned delivery. She was one of gospel's great performers, regularly stirring crowds into a frenzy with her intense vocalizations and animated physical style.         She also had a subtle but substantial role in the civil rights movement. She sang at many benefit concerts and in her music alluded to current events. In her 1964 song ''The Hymn,'' she preached: ''When the president was assassinated, the nation said, 'Where is God?' When the little children lost their lives in the church bombing, the nation cried, 'Where is God?' I got the answer for you today: God is still on the throne.''         Born Dorothy McGriff in Birmingham, she was one of seven children of a minister who divorced when Ms. Coates was young. She sang in local churches and started a family group, the Royal Gospel Singers, as a teenager. She quit school after the 10th grade to support her family as a maid.         ''On weekdays I worked for the white man. On weekends I sang for the people,'' she told Mr. Heilbut in his 1971 book, ''The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times.''         Ms. Coates joined the Gospel Harmonettes, a well-known Birmingham group, and in 1951 the group cut its first hit, ''I'm Sealed,'' and quickly rose to fame on the gospel circuit. She continued with the Harmonettes throughout the 50's and 60's on a variety of record labels, writing much of the group's material. Among its hits were ''You Must Be Born Again'' and ''That's Enough'' on the Specialty label, ''I Won't Let Go of My Faith'' on the Nashboro label and ''You've Been Good to Me'' on VeeJay. She also sang ''No Hiding Place'' and ''(You Can't Hurry God) He's Right On Time.''         The Harmonettes broke up in 1970, though Ms. Coates continued to perform with the Dorothy Love Coates Singers, featuring her sister Lillian and other singers from Birmingham. She sang at the Newport Jazz Festival several times, including in a 1975 tribute to Mahalia Jackson at Carnegie Hall.         She stopped recording in 1980, but appeared in two films, in ''The Long Walk Home'' (1990) and in ''Beloved'' (1998), in which she can be seen leading a chorus of ex-slaves in an inspirational song.         Ms. Coates married twice. Her first marriage, to Willie Love of the Fairfield Four, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Carl Coates of the Sensational Nightingales, died in 1999.         She is survived by her daughters, Cassandra Madison of Birmingham and Carletta Criss of Arlington, Tex.; a brother, Fred McGriff of Newark; a sister, Naomi Chambers of Plainfield, N.J.; and two granddaughters.         Ms. Coates's music influenced many pop and rhythm-and-blues singers, such as Mavis Staples of the Staple Singers, and Cissy Houston, and she was well aware of that. But she steadfastly refused to betray her calling by singing blues, jazz or any other secular idiom.         ''I can't sell out,'' she told Mr. Heilbut.       
         A. J. Levinson, who pressed a national campaign to improve what she called ''the quality of death'' by promoting living wills, and who educated both professionals and the public on ways to bring dignity to dying, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was widespread cancer, her daughter Martha Levinson said.         Ann-Jane Levinson (she preferred A. J.) was executive director of Concern for Dying for 11 years beginning in 1976, a period in which thorny cases like that of Karen Ann Quinlan, who spent years on life support equipment, provoked deep questioning about how people die. Ms. Levinson's message was that family doctors, nurses and others should strive to honor the dying person's wishes.         The group, which is defunct, grew out of the Euthanasia Educational Council. Perhaps its most important accomplishment was helping develop and promote the concept of the living will. Such a will is a formal document that permits a person to record desires for how the end of life should be handled. Living wills often express the determination to die a ''natural death'' and not to have life extended artificially by life support equipment.         These documents, which millions of people in many states have prepared, can call for ending medical procedures that have been instituted in the patient's behalf. Most deputize a relative or an acquaintance to act if the patient is incapacitated, and health care proxies, their formal name, are recognized as binding in many states.         The organization sent out more than seven million forms for living wills to groups and individuals all over the country. After a single mention in an Ann Landers column, hundreds of thousands of requests poured in.         The group also advocated allowing people to have ample pain medication at the end of their lives, if they wished.         ''Doctors are afraid of things like addiction and overdosing when that isn't the primary concern to a terminal patient in severe pain,'' Ms. Levinson said in an interview in 1985 with The Record, a newspaper in northern New Jersey.         But she denounced mercy killing.         ''I don't think society should be in the business of killing people,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ''I don't think killing is a person's right.''         She was born in Boston on Jan. 7, 1929. Her mother drove an ambulance in France during World War I. Her father, Dr. John Rock, was a professor at Harvard Medical School who helped develop the first birth control pill. Earlier, he had angered the Roman Catholic Church by performing abortions.         She graduated from the Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., and Bryn Mawr, where she majored in history. She then briefly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, but never told her family what she did.         She had two daughters, Martha Levinson and Kate Ewing, both of Manhattan, and a son, Paul T. Levinson of Milton, Mass., with her husband, Henry W. Levinson, who also survives, as does a sister, Rachel Achenbach of Boxford, Mass.         In 1957, she did graduate work in psychology and sociology at Columbia, then taught at several private schools in Manhattan. She introduced courses on sex education, drug abuse and skills for urban living.         Katherine Strauss Mali, president of Concern for Dying, hired her as executive director in 1976. Martha Levinson said her mother was motivated by the vastly different experiences of two dying relatives: her brother died alone and miserable with hospital officials barring visits; while her mother died at home surrounded by loved ones.         Much of her work involved bringing people from different disciplines together in seminars about death and dying. She appeared on national television programs like ''The Tonight Show.'' She had her children stuff living wills into envelopes for mailing.         She formally retired in 1988, after suffering a debilitating stroke the previous year. She had a living will.         Her husband said she did not like death. She was interested in the conduct of living people.         Correction:  May 4, 2002, Saturday  An obituary on Wednesday about A. J. Levinson, an advocate for living wills, included a family member's erroneous reference to the work of her father, Dr. John Rock, in the field of birth control. The family says Dr. Rock, a professor at Harvard Medical School who helped develop the birth control pill, did not perform abortions.       
         Sharon L. Monsky, a scleroderma sufferer who founded an organization that raised millions of dollars to look for a cure for the disease, died on Saturday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 48 and lived in Santa Barbara.         The cause was systemic scleroderma, said Charles Spaulding, a vice president of the organization, the Scleroderma Research Foundation, which Ms. Monsky founded in 1987.         Ms. Monsky had systemic scleroderma, a chronic and painful disease afflicting the connective tissues, for two decades. She was the foundation's chairman and chief executive until she died.         ''She was a leader in raising awareness and funding in search of a cure for scleroderma,'' said Dr. M. Kari Connolly, a professor of dermatology and medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, who has been doing research about scleroderma for 10 years.         The struggle for awareness and money encountered problems. Ms. Monsky said in a 1990 interview with The New York Times: ''It's a hard one to sell. It's a mysterious disease. It's an ugly disease. And there are no scleroderma poster children to help.''         In the early 1980's, when she found out that she had scleroderma, which hardens the skin and internal organs, Ms. Monsky was given only two years to live. But as she lived on, she decided to create the foundation.         She had a master's degree in business administration and had become a highly regarded management consultant with McKinsey & Company, which she had to leave in 1985 after her health deteriorated. She applied her business expertise to the foundation.         Besides corporate donors, celebrities in the performing arts were persuaded to donate time and money to the cause.         Ms. Monsky's activities generated more than $14 million for research and helped expand understanding of the disease. Money she disbursed for basic medical research on scleroderma led to the publication of scientific articles exploring potential cures. Her work also helped make scleroderma better known.         The foundation's activities include operating two sites for research on the disease, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of California at San Francisco. The foundation also has adjunct laboratories at Ohio State, Stanford and Duke Universities.         Born in Omaha, Ms. Monsky was a top amateur figure skater as a teenager. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., and a master's degree in business administration from Stanford.         She was separated from her husband, Mark Scher.         She is survived by her mother, Ramelle Monsky of Palm Desert, Calif.; a son, Max, and two daughters, Samantha and Montana, all of Santa Barbara; a sister, Robin Monsky of Chicago; and a brother, Henry Monsky of Omaha.       
         Laura Johnson, a flamboyant New York social figure who reveled in personal publicity but refused to have her many philanthropies made public, died May 12 at her home in Manhattan. She was believed to be in her late 80's, but although she celebrated her birth date, July 17, her birth year remained a mystery even to those closest to her.         Mrs. Johnson and her husband, Raymond Johnson, a Saks Fifth Avenue executive who died in 1965, were prominent members of cafe society, constantly seen and photographed at El Morocco, the Stork Club and other fashionable nightclubs of the era, and at numerous charity benefits.         She was never lost in a crowd. She delighted in being the center of attention and worked at it. On occasion, though, she was not above shooing away people who might share a photograph with her.         She subscribed to the more-is-better school of fashion and was well aware of the swiveling heads and incredulous stares as she strolled the Upper East Side, or anywhere else. Just when it seemed she could go no further with her extraordinary hats, she appeared in a confection fashioned like a rooster sitting in a nest of feathers, the whole thing perched rakishly on her explosion of red hair.         A friend who encountered her on Madison Avenue swathed from head to knees in blue fox, complete with tails, made a mild remark about the generous amount of fur.         ''No one outfoxes Laura Johnson,'' she said.         Bill Cunningham, who over four decades photographed her on numerous occasions, said: ''She liked clothes and people with spirit. She could give you a snow job, and when you called her on it, she'd back down and laugh at herself.''         At benefits she paraded in bejeweled exuberance, her designer gowns notable for a décolletage that verged on the reckless.         Other than her age, the only thing she refused to discuss or make public was her philanthropy. In one typical gesture several years before the World Trade Center terrorist attack, she gave the Police Department $1 million.         ''She came into my office with Howard Safir, then the police commissioner,'' the former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Thursday at her memorial service. ''She wouldn't let us have a press conference or publicize her contribution other than within the department.''         After Sept. 11, she gave another $1 million to the families of police officers and firefighters, he said.         She was also a generous contributor to Literacy Partners, the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of the City of New York. She also raised funds for what was then the American Symphony Orchestra and the charities that benefited from the April in Paris Ball.         Mrs. Johnson, then Laura Safir, met her future husband in 1956, three years after arriving in Manhattan from Europe. They were married two years later, and shortly after Igor Cassini, who wrote the Cholly Knickerbocker gossip column, described her as the city's ''bird of paradise.''         She was born near Bucharest, Romania, one of 11 children, and received her primary education there. She spent the years after 1948, as pieced together from family and friends, at the Sorbonne in Paris, where, she said, she received doctorates in law and philosophy, but apparently never practiced or taught in either discipline.         After her arrival in New York in 1953, she took courses in English at Hunter College, but her speech always retained a decided European inflection.         Her survivors include a brother, Adorel Safir, who lives in Israel, and a stepson, Patrick Johnson of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.         Before her death she had a farewell message that was illustrated with her favorite flower, a rose, printed for the friends who attended her memorial. ''I love you and I will watch over all of you with love,'' it read in part, and she signed each one individually.         ''She was a caricature but a lovable one,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''Her life was a banquet, and she wanted her friends to share it.''       
         Niki de Saint Phalle, a Franco-American artist internationally known for her colorful, monumental, cartoonlike sculptures and environments, died on Tuesday in San Diego, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was pulmonary failure after an illness of several months, said Harry Mathews, the writer and her first husband.         A heroine to feminism before the modern movement even emerged, Ms. de Saint Phalle first made her mark in Paris in the early 60's when she was associated with the Nouveaux Réalistes, a group of avant-gardists that included the sculptors Christo, Arman and Jean Tinguely. Their antic, absurdist works challenged conventional ideas about art-making in ways that echoed the earlier Dada movement.         Ms. de Saint Phalle became notorious for what she called ''target paintings,'' at which darts were thrown, and then for actual ''shooting paintings'' and sculptures. In galleries, she would use a .22-caliber rifle to shoot at plaster sculptures in which she had embedded bags of paint, causing color to splatter all over.         Ms. de Saint Phalle went on to produce a far different kind of art, an amalgam of Pop, Surrealism, Folk and outsider art that she prolifically realized in sculptures, paintings, prints and large public installations. Inspired in the mid-60's by a visit from the wife of Larry Rivers, Clarice Rivers, who was then pregnant, Ms. de Saint Phalle created the first of what would become an extensive population of ''Nanas.'' (Nana is a mildly rude French term for woman, comparable to broad.) They were bulbous, archetypal maternal figures like Mexican piñatas painted in bold colors and decorated with crisp, cartoon outlines.         In contrast with the aggressive Conceptualism of her early performance works, the art for which she became best known seemed to flow from an endlessly fertile, visionary imagination.         The Nanas gave birth to legions of fanciful humanoids, animals, plants and monsters and a trend away from the refinement of individual objects toward the creation of whole, fantastic worlds that would be most fully achieved in ambitious public works like Surrealistic amusement parks. Made of cement and produced on a gigantic scale, the Nanas became houses that visitors could enter, and surrounding grounds became teeming, part-organic, part-architectural mazes. At once avant-garde and populist, Ms. de Saint Phalle's art had the unusual ability to appeal to a wide range of viewers, from art-world professionals to children.         In the late 1970's, on acreage in southwestern Tuscany made available by wealthy friends, Ms. de Saint Phalle began her most ambitious project, a sprawling sculpture garden featuring 22 large sculptures based on the fortune-telling Tarot cards. With its wildly grotesque forms decorated by ceramic tiles, glass and mirrors, it calls to mind the architecture of Antonio Gaudí, whose work made a lasting impression on Ms. de Saint Phalle when she first encountered it in the 1950's. Financing it in part through the sale of a perfume called Niki de Saint Phalle, which she created for the Jacqueline Cochran company, Ms. de Saint Phalle worked on the Tarot Garden for 20 years. It opened to the public in 1998.         Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle was born into a wealthy family on Oct. 29, 1930, at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, but was partly raised in New York, where her parents moved after the crash of 1929, and educated at the Brearley School, among several others. She told of being thrown out of Brearley for painting the fig leaves on the school artworks red.         At 18 she eloped with Mr. Mathews, and two years later the couple moved to France, where she began to paint after a nervous breakdown at age 23. She was mostly a self-taught artist. Her first solo exhibition took place in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 1956, but she did not begin to show her work regularly until 1961.         Divorced from Mr. Mathews in 1960, she began a relationship with Jean Tinguely, the Swiss sculptor known for his kinetic, mechanical sculptures. They were married in 1971 and she collaborated with him on many projects. Although they lived separately after their marriage, their partnership lasted until his death in 1991. Ms. de Saint Phalle returned to the United States in 1994 to settle in La Jolla, in San Diego, partly because of her frail health.         In addition to producing public works in cities from Jerusalem to San Diego, Ms. de Saint Phalle had many museum exhibitions. The Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts in New York assembled her first American retrospective in 1987, and a larger retrospective was organized by the Kunst und Austellunghalle in Bonn in 1992. In 1994, an institution dedicated to her work, the Niki Museum, opened in Nasu, Japan. In 2000 she won a $140,000 Praemium Imperiale Award given by the Japan Art Association.         Ms. de Saint Phalle is survived by a brother, John de Saint Phalle, of Florida; a daughter, Laura Duke, of Paris; a son, Philip Mathews, of New York; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Zypora Spaisman, who did everything to keep Yiddish theater alive, from producing plays to selling tickets to sweeping floors to her great love, acting (including not a few Jewish-mother roles), died on May 18 in Manhattan. She was 86.         The Yiddish stage was the center of Mrs. Spaisman's life, from her girlhood in Poland to a Soviet labor camp to Paris and Montreal and finally to New York, where she became a principal force in maintaining the nation's only surviving Yiddish theater, the Folksbiene (People's Stage). She seems never to have made a penny for her efforts.         ''Nearly single-handedly, she led the pack in the fight to keep Yiddish theater going,'' said Eleanor Reissa, the artistic director of the Folksbiene, for which Mrs. Spaisman was once in charge of productions.         In 1914 there were 14 Yiddish theaters in New York, and avant-garde movements like naturalism, expressionism and Stanislavsky's Method often found their first expression there. But the combined effects of the Holocaust, the diffusion and assimilation of American Jews and the aging of the immigrant population gnawed away at audience numbers.         A bitter, often-quoted joke in Yiddish circles is that each time one of the Yiddish theater's remaining audience members dies, a seat is removed so it will not look empty. But dwindling numbers only heightened Mrs. Spaisman's determination.         ''My whole life has been about preserving the Yiddish language,'' she said in an interview. ''Hitler didn't kill it. Neither did Stalin.''         Zypora Tanenbaum was born in Lublin, Poland, on Jan. 2, 1916. By the time she was 10, she was participating in town and school dramatic presentations in both Polish and Yiddish, a language that mingles Old High German and Hebrew, with Slavic and Romance elements.         She graduated from nursing school, became a midwife in 1933, and married Joseph Spaisman in 1938. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, she saw her sister shot. The Spaismans fled to the Russian part of Poland, and from there were taken to a labor camp in the Urals.         Mrs. Spaisman delivered more than 1,000 babies while in the camp. Each Sunday, she would organize a Yiddish theatrical presentation in a different barracks, said her son, Ben-Ami, who survives her, along with his two children.         When Mrs. Spaisman returned to Poland after the war, she learned that all the members of her family were dead, as were most of the country's Jews. She acted in the Yiddish theater in Lodz, working with the great Yiddish comedians Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Shumakher. In Paris and Montreal, where she waited with her husband and son for permission to enter the United States, she also worked in the theater.         The Spaismans came to New York in 1955, and she sought stage work at the Hebrew Actors Union, but was rebuffed. So she went to the Folksbiene, which she had heard about from a Polish director.         The company, which opened in 1915, is now the oldest continually performing Yiddish theater in the world. Although Mrs. Spaisman never worked with the renowned actress Molly Picon, she appeared with many of the other luminaries of the Yiddish stage.         She often created characters that combined surface humor with inner wisdom. The publication Back Stage called her ''the grande dame,'' and The Jewish Week referred to her as ''a national treasure.'' Reviewing ''The Land of Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1989, Richard F. Shepard called her ''the mistress of the glumly comic look and acerbic tongue.''         Mrs. Spaisman's fans seemed to respond to her performances as if the characters she played were real. Once when she portrayed a shabbily dressed town gossip, two women met her outside the theater with new stockings and blouses.         ''You make us laugh, you make us cry,'' they told Mrs. Spaisman, according to The Jerusalem Post. ''You're so poorly dressed, we brought you these things.''         In 1989, Mrs. Spaisman appeared in the movie ''Enemies: A Love Story,'' directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver. During her acting career, she won an Obie Award, a Drama Desk Award and a New York City People's Choice Award.         Mrs. Spaisman, who lived in Manhattan, supported herself by working as a recreation director at the Jewish Institute for Geriatric Care, first in Manhattan and then in New Hyde Park, N.Y. On a typical day, she left for work at 7 and returned at 5 to cook dinner for her husband and son. Then she went to rehearsal. Performances were on weekends.         Mr. Spaisman died in 1997. In 1998, Mrs. Spaisman was shocked when the Folksbiene board eliminated her position -- executive producer -- to hire younger producers attuned to younger audiences. She refused to retire gracefully.         ''They wanted to give me a nice party,'' she said in an interview in The Times in 2000, ''to get money in my name and give it to the Folksbiene. And I should step down. I have to be such an idiot?''         Ms. Reissa said she wanted Mrs. Spaisman to remain as a valuable consultant; Mrs. Spaisman refused. With her death, the three people who long steered the Folksbiene are now gone: Benjamin Schechter, managing director, died in 1994, and Morris Adler, president, died in December at 107.         After what Mrs. Spaisman insisted on viewing as her dismissal, she took the Folksbiene's mailing list with her and started a new Yiddish theater company, the Yiddish Public Theater.         She cast herself in a starring role in November 2000 in its first and so far only production: ''Grine Felder'' (''Green Fields''). A review in Back Stage said that in her role as a mother, she ''proves that passing time cannot deter a real trouper.''       
         Antonia Pantoja, an advocate for New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin whose educational organization Aspira won a landmark lawsuit in the 70's that brought bilingual education to New York City public schools, died on Friday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was cancer, said her partner, Dr. Wilhelmina Perry.         Dr. Pantoja, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1996 for her efforts to provide educational and economic opportunities for Puerto Ricans, was born in poverty in San Juan, P.R., in 1922. Wealthy neighbors helped her attend the University of Puerto Rico, where she earned a teaching certificate in 1942. She taught in a rural school for two years, then, as a member of the first wave of impoverished emigrants from the island, she moved to New York City.         At first finding wartime factory work as a welder, she won a scholarship to Hunter College, graduating with a bachelor's in sociology in 1952. She earned a master's degree from Columbia University's New York School of Social Work in 1954.         Upon graduation, Dr. Pantoja focused her attention on the grinding poverty of Puerto Ricans in New York. At the time, half the Puerto Rican families lived below the poverty line; 70 percent of those who were employed worked in the lowest-paying jobs; 50 percent of those above the age of 25 had less than an eighth-grade education; and 40 percent lived in substandard housing.         To begin addressing these problems, Dr. Pantoja founded the Puerto Rican Forum in 1957 to serve as an incubator for organizations and programs promoting economic self-sufficiency. The nonprofit organization is now known as the National Puerto Rican Forum.         Dr. Pantoja directed most of her energies, however, to improving the performance in New York schools of Puerto Rican children, children of Spanish speakers who were taught only in English. By 1961, two out of three eighth graders had fallen more than three years behind in reading; by 1963, when there were 179,000 Puerto Rican public school students, only 331 received high school academic diplomas, and only 28 went on to college.         In response, in 1961, Dr. Pantoja established Aspira, a nonprofit organization encouraging educational attainment, self-esteem, cultural awareness and leadership development.         Operating through clubs in city schools, Aspira used rituals and symbols to appeal to students tempted by gang culture. It had a solemn induction ceremony, based on a Taino Indian ritual, in which ''aspirantes'' held candles and pledged to pursue educational excellence and to dedicate their success to their community. Its symbol was the pitirre, a small tropical bird known for its agility and speed. The group taught the ''Aspira process'' of awareness, analysis and action.         Aspira now has offices in six states and Puerto Rico, and provides approximately 50,000 Latino students with career and college counseling, financial aid and other assistance. The program's graduates include Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president and 2001 mayoral candidate, and Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.         As politics changed in the United States, especially with President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, Dr. Pantoja shifted her emphasis from self-help programs to reform of the educational system.         In 1964, she helped draw up a request by the Puerto Rican Forum for $12.5 million from the city's antipoverty council to establish bilingual prekindergarten classes, after-school programs for struggling students, parental guidance and adult education courses, and other programs.         In 1967, she served on a committee, convened by Mayor John V. Lindsay, that recommended the decentralization of the school system. That summer, after the riots that occurred in many American cities, she attended the New York constitutional convention in Albany, where she pressed for the state to assume constitutional responsibility for free higher education, adult education and ''compensatory education'' for the disadvantaged.         In 1972, frustrated by what Dr. Pantoja saw as the continuing failure of city schools to educate Puerto Rican students -- who still had a graduation rate of only 30 percent -- Aspira filed a civil rights suit in federal court demanding that New York City provide classroom instruction in Spanish for struggling students. The suit resulted in a 1974 ruling ordering the city to establish bilingual classes and English as a second language classes for Latino students whose English skills were in the lowest fifth.         Dr. Pantoja was also active in higher education. In 1970, she established the Universidad Boricua and the Puerto Rican Research and Resource Center in Washington, becoming its chancellor in 1973, the same year that she earned a Ph.D. from Union Graduate School in Ohio. She joined the faculty of San Diego State University's School of Social Work in 1978, and later founded the Graduate School for Community Development.         After 1984, Dr. Pantoja devoted much of her time to work in Puerto Rico, establishing Producir, an organization that provides economic assistance to small businesses in poor rural areas, and Provivienda, which works to develop housing.         She is survived by her partner, Dr. Perry; her brother, Esteban Lopez; and her sister, Haydee Lopez.         Her autobiography, ''Memoir of a Visionary,'' is being published this month by Arte Público Press. She was also working on a history of Aspira.       
         Lois Gould, a best-selling novelist, essayist and memoirist known for her acutely observed portrayals of the emotional complexities of women's lives, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         She had fought cancer for some time, said her son, Anthony C. Gould.         Ms. Gould was perhaps best known for her debut novel, ''Such Good Friends'' (1970, Random House). Partly autobiographical, the book is about a woman who learns of her husband's wide-ranging infidelities only as he is dying in a hospital. It spent seven weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and was released as a film the next year.         Most recently, Ms. Gould published a critically praised memoir, ''Mommy Dressing: A Love Story, After a Fashion'' (Anchor/Doubleday, 1998), a cleareyed recollection of life with her glamorous, remote mother, the fashion designer Jo Copeland. Reviewing the memoir in The New York Times Book Review, Margo Jefferson wrote that ''dispassionate compassion is a very moving quality, and it marks 'Mommy Dressing' from beginning to end.''         As an essayist and critic, Ms. Gould was a frequent contributor to The Times, writing the inaugural Hers column in 1977 and many thereafter. Her subjects included sexual politics, family and the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between men's and women's attitudes toward emotionally laden topics like adultery, eroticism and divorce.         Ms. Gould was born Lois Regensburg to parents ensconced in the Stork Club set of Manhattan. Her father, Edward J. Regensburg Jr., a debonair cigar manufacturer, left the family, ''whistling,'' she would write, when Lois was 3. Her mother, whose designs were prized by the social lights of New York, Hollywood and Europe, was consumed by her passion for her work and her distaste for her children.         As parties rustled silkenly in Jo Copeland's Park Avenue living room -- guests might include Joan Crawford or Tyrone Power -- Lois and her brother were expected to remain in their rooms with their supper trays, blissfully unseen and unheard.         After graduating from Wellesley, Ms. Gould reported on the criminal courts for The Long Island Star-Journal, a newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that has since folded. She became an editor on several national magazines and served as executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal. She married Philip Benjamin, a novelist and a reporter for The Times, in 1955.         In 1966 her husband died suddenly after surgery, leaving her with two boys. Among her husband's papers, Ms. Gould found a diary written in code. She cracked the code and discovered a catalog of his extramarital liaisons, many with her friends. The experience provided a foundation for her first novel.         In ''Such Good Friends,'' Julie Messinger, a young mother, uncovers a similar diary as her husband lies dying. Ms. Gould's novel offered a raw, darkly comic portrait of Julie's emotional life -- her grief, rage, amphetamine popping and suicidal depression -- along with frank depictions of her sexual life, which ran the gamut from quiet marital frustration to ardent masturbation.         The book caused a sensation in 1970, when Americans were still struggling to comprehend the social upheavals set in motion by the women's movement.         Likening Julie to a female Alex Portnoy, Saturday Review said: ''What some men find offensive in 'Such Good Friends' is just this kind of intimate disclosure'': the passage under critical scrutiny involved reading Krafft-Ebing in bed while eating Sara Lee fudge cake. The review continued, ''Women aren't supposed to have equal sexual and human rights -- and talk about them as openly as men.''         In 1967 Ms. Gould married the psychiatrist Robert E. Gould. (Her sons, whom Dr. Gould adopted, took his surname.) Dr. Gould died n 1998; Ms. Gould's son Roger V. Gould, a sociologist at Yale University, died of leukemia at 39 on April 29. Ms. Gould is survived by her son Anthony, of Manhattan, and her brother, Anthony Regensburg, of Camden, Me., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Among Ms. Gould's other books are the novels ''Necessary Objects'' (1972), ''Final Analysis'' (1974), ''A Sea Change'' (1976) and ''La Presidenta'' (1981) and the essay collection ''Not Responsible for Personal Articles'' (1978).         If Ms. Gould was known primarily for her knife-edged fictional depictions of marriage and its discontents, she was an equally incisive observer of human connection -- and disconnection -- in her nonfiction.         In an evocative passage about her mother, she recalled a bittersweet childhood ritual: watching Jo Copeland at her vanity table as she prepared for an evening out.         ''It seemed to me an ark of some covenant, with hidden doors that swung open to reveal fragrant jars and beautiful bottles, each of which held other secrets,'' she wrote.         ''Everything I knew about my mother, Jo Copeland, happened right there,'' Ms. Gould continued. ''For what I knew about her was only the dressing. Nothing of the rest of her life was visible to me. Unless the dressing was, in fact, the life.''       
         Barbara Anne Castle, a onetime Labor cabinet minister and determined socialist whose radical, ill-timed attempt to tame Britain's mighty trade unions doomed her political career, died yesterday. She was 91.         She died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Buckinghamshire, her family said in a statement. In a tribute, Prime Minister Tony Blair described her as a ''radical independent spirit.''         Baroness Castle of Blackburn, as she became in 1990, served in Harold Wilson's first two Labor cabinets, from 1964 to 1970, and in his third, from 1974 to 1976. After Mr. Wilson's surprise resignation in 1976, she might well have become party leader and the first woman to serve as prime minister. But the unions, aroused by her efforts to curb their power, cut short her rise.         In 1969, as secretary of state for employment and productivity and with the prime minister's enthusiastic support, Ms. Castle had published a plan called ''In Place of Strife,'' which sought to inject some discipline into Britain's chaotic industrial relations by making trade unions subject to legal sanctions.         The proposal proved popular with the public at large but split the Labor cabinet and provoked so furious a backlash from the unions, on whom the party relied for votes and money, that it had to be withdrawn.         The home secretary, James Callaghan, had led the opposition to her plan within the cabinet, and when he succeeded Mr. Wilson as prime minister in 1976 his first act was to dismiss her. He told her she was too old for ministerial office.         Three years later, despite a lifetime's opposition to British membership of the European Common Market, as it was then called, Ms. Castle left the House of Commons and embarked on a second political career as a member of the European Parliament, where she spent the next 10 years fighting European federalism but supporting efforts to establish Europe-wide social standards.         Considered one of the most left-wing members of Mr. Wilson's three cabinets, Ms. Castle was an intensely ideological politician, a stranger to compromise and pragmatism whose misfortune was to serve at a time when Britain's perilous economic condition required both skills.         As Britain's first minister of overseas development, she pulled together a disparate array of aid programs run by different departments and subjected them all to a single test: the promotion of development in backward countries.         In 1965 she took over the transport ministry, where she confronted the railway unions with a recommendation to close 2,000 stations and 3,000 miles of track -- a task proposed by the preceding Conservative government.         She also introduced breathalyzer testing in a crackdown on drunken driving that cut road deaths by 1,200 in the first year and ordered safety belts fitted to new cars.         As secretary for employment and productivity, she legislated equal pay for men and women. And after a spell in opposition, she overhauled Britain's social security system as secretary for social services, linking state pensions to average earnings and introducing new child allowances paid directly to the mother rather than through a husband's pay check.         But she always served in governments buffeted by industrial unrest and unending currency crises, which forced them into deflationary policies she could never accept. She also served under party leaders anxious to maintain good relations with Washington during the Vietnam War, which she strongly opposed. She differed with the leaders also over their resolve to retain Britain's nuclear deterrent, which she wanted to abandon, and their determination to keep Britain in the European Common Market, which she had never wished to join.         Barbara Anne Betts was born on Oct. 10, 1910, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the daughter of a socialist tax inspector who taught himself ancient Greek and a strongly socialist mother, both of Quaker background.         From Bradford Girls Grammar School she won a scholarship to St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where, excluded from the student debating society, known as the Union, because it did not admit women, she threw herself into Labor Party politics to the neglect of everything else, graduating with a disappointing third-class degree.         After Oxford she entered local politics in London and helped found a left-wing weekly, Tribune, which was edited by her lover, William Mellor, who died before they could marry. Soon afterward she met Ted Castle, a political journalist, and married him in 1944. He died in 1979. They had no children.         She was sent to Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire in 1945 as part of the postwar Labor landslide. The election brought Clement Attlee to power and led to the creation of the National Health Service and the nationalization of large swaths of British industry.         Ms. Castle's personal popularity with the party's rank and file was confirmed in 1950 when she was elected to its national executive committee, a post she held until 1979. But in her autobiography she acknowledged that the split between the party's extreme left wing (led by the Welsh firebrand Aneurin Bevan) and Labor's leadership ''helped keep the party out of office for 13 years.''         In 1952, Mr. Bevan published a personal political testament called ''In Place of Fear'' that greatly influenced Ms. Castle's thinking and largely explains how a self-proclaimed leftist like herself could set out to discipline Britain's powerful unions.         She borrowed shamelessly from its title when she called her reform blueprint ''In Place of Strife,'' thus seeking to place it in the middle of radical Labor Party thinking. What inspired those reforms, she wrote in her autobiography, was Bevan's plea for politicians to be more flexible and his belief that their ''Holy Grail'' should be ''the living truth, knowing that the truth being alive must change.''         This lead Ms. Castle to conclude, as she put it, that ''the trade unions, being an expression of the living truth, must learn to change their role'' and become more responsive to the needs of society as a whole.         Although ''In Place of Strife'' was stillborn, the task she had set herself would be accomplished a decade later by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, in every way her antithesis and a woman she disliked.       
         Shirley Hayes, who waged a long battle -- called quixotic by some, psychotic by others -- that eventually succeeded in banning cars from Washington Square Park in Manhattan, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 89.         She marshaled children in strollers, including her own four sons, to press the case that Greenwich Village's only significant park had no business being a bus turnaround, much less being cut in half by a four-lane road.         She collected 16,000 signatures and the endorsements of politicians, newspapers, 12 parent-teacher associations and the Lions Club. When others sought some middle ground, say a smaller road, Mrs. Hayes spurned deal making.         ''When Shirley refused to compromise, I told her she was turning into a crackpot,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, in an interview with McCall's magazine in 1967. At the time he was a lawyer living in the Village.         ''I thought it was unreasonable to expect the city to cut a major artery and detour traffic through narrow streets,'' Mr. Koch said, ''but she proved her goal was not unrealistic.''         The long-running drama included some legendary New Yorkers: Robert Moses, the powerful official who demanded the biggest road possible, was her arch enemy. Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady who had once lived on Washington Square, was her illustrious supporter. Carmine DeSapio, the leader of Tammany Hall, was the éminence grise who at the final moment gave the quiet nod to her position.         ''This was where the tide turned against the indiscriminate taking of parkland for automotive purposes,'' said Henry J. Stern, the former city parks commissioner, who last year put up a sign in Washington Square honoring the event.         Mrs. Hayes was born Shirley Zak on June 15, 1912, in Chicago. She attended the University of Wisconsin and studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and acting at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She moved to New York in 1932 to pursue a career in acting. In 1936, she appeared in Leslie Howard's ''Hamlet,'' which was making Broadway history by competing with Sir John Gielgud's ''Hamlet.'' She played a lady in waiting and met her husband, James, during the production; he played a pallbearer.         They had four sons: Christopher, who lives in Manhattan and Los Angeles, and his twin, Kerry, who lives in Toronto, Timothy, of Manhattan and East Hampton, and Dennis, of Rio de Janeiro and Manhattan. In addition to her sons, she is survived by four grandchildren.         Mrs. Hayes, who was often busy entertaining clients for her husband, who had gone into advertising, also became involved in other neighborhood causes, like fighting the large apartment houses that Robert Moses eventually built south of Washington Square. Because she frequently took her sons to Washington Square Park, she leapt into the fight in 1952, when Mr. Moses proposed building a 48-foot roadway through it. The road -- which would have linked Fifth Avenue on the north side of the park to West Broadway on the south -- would have wiped out some playgrounds. ''A few women got together to say no, no, no,'' Mrs. Hayes said in an interview with The Villager, a neighborhood paper, last fall.         The debate took many turns; one big struggle was over what to do with the buses that already used the park as a turnaround. Eventually politicians came up with the idea of using a smaller road as a compromise. The original proposal for a below-the-ground road was changed to ground level. But Mrs. Hayes had decided she would accept nothing less than no road through the park, and no vehicles of any kind in it, including the buses.         ''She took the extreme position,'' said Anthony Dapolito, owner of Vesuvio Bakery and long a leader in Greenwich Village politics. ''She and the mothers kept insisting and wouldn't give up.''         On April 9, 1959, the city's Board of Estimate, the body that then governed the city's spending and land use, voted to oust cars entirely, shortly after Mr. DeSapio, always attuned to opinion in the Village, had passed the word that he wanted them out.         In her 1961 book, ''The Life and Death of Great American Cities,'' Jane Jacobs noted the courage of the position taken by Mrs. Hayes and her allies: ''They advocated eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all automobile traffic -- but at the same time, not widening the perimeter roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without compensating for it.''         Ms. Jacobs wrote that traffic did not become unmanageable, and that more of the low-scale profile of Greenwich Village was preserved. Others suggested that the defeat of the road represented the first nail in the coffin of Mr. Moses's plan for a Lower Manhattan expressway. The park road would have fed into the Moses freeway, which he planned to link the bridges and tunnels to Brooklyn and New Jersey.         Mrs. Hayes was divorced in 1965 and went to work as a classical radio disc jockey on WNYC's ''While the City Sleeps'' and other programs. She also worked with Mayor John V. Lindsay, for whom she campaigned, on making the city friendlier to movie companies. She was a charter member of the National Organization for Women.         Correction:  May 15, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Shirley Hayes, who successfully fought a road through Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, reversed two words in the title of a book by the urban planning critic Jane Jacobs, which praised her. It is ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' not ''Life and Death.''       
         Prof. Florence G. Roswell, who spent more than half a century teaching and writing, particularly about ways to diagnose and overcome reading disabilities, died May 4 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 97.         A former director of the reading clinic at the City College of New York, she remained active into her 90's, with several of her books and manuals published or reissued within the last few years.         She worked with Dr. Jeanne S. Chall, another leading expert on teaching children to read, to devise instructional materials to guide teachers. First published in the 1950's, these materials had a revival in the 1990's and remain in print. Dr. Chall died in 1999.         In 1997, Educators Publishing Company reissued the ''Roswell-Chall Auditory Blending Test,'' and the ''Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Test of Word Analysis Skills.''         Florence Garfunkel Roswell was born in Manhattan in June 1904. She entered New York University at 16, majoring in English literature; she graduated in 1924.         She taught second grade for several years while taking graduate education courses at Teachers College. When children in her classroom were having trouble learning to read, she asked them to come to school earlier and stay later to help them catch up.         City College offered her a teaching fellowship in 1942, asking her to test children with various reading problems and to supervise student teachers. At the time, conventional wisdom regarding reading disabilities was that a child's difficulties were rooted in emotional problems, and that not much could be done by the teacher until the problems were addressed.         Based on her experience in testing and teaching poor readers, Professor Roswell took a more positive tack. She concluded that a child's reading deficiencies required special attention regardless of emotional problems. Her views and those of like-minded teachers eventually prevailed. Their stand brought about recognition of distinct disabilities like various kinds of dyslexia.         For teaching reading, she advocated using phonics along with the whole language method, or a system that chiefly exposes students to the sight of words. The dual approach meant that readers could be able to decode sounds and words.         Her first text, ''Reading Disability: A Human Approach,'' was published in the 1960's and had four printings. Most recently she was a co-author of ''Teaching Children to Read, a Step-by-Step Guide for Volunteer Tutors'' (Continental Press, 1998); and ''Creating Successful Readers'' (Riverside, 1994).         Professor Roswell is survived by a son, Dr. Arthur, of Bridgewater, N.J.; a daughter, Elaine Roswell of New Haven; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her husband, David S. Roswell, an economist, died in the 1960's.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Zena Sutherland, the most prominent reviewer of American children's books for nearly three decades and the author of five editions of ''Children and Books,'' the classic textbook on the subject, died on June 12 in Chicago. She was 86.         As the editor and reviewer of The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, essentially a one-woman operation, she concisely assessed about 30,000 titles, more than 100 a month, from 1958 to 1985. The Bulletin is directed to librarians, but her words were also taken seriously by editors, publishers, writers and illustrators.         ''No other individual's views had such an impact on children's books then or now,'' said Roger Sutton, the editor of The Horn Book magazine and one of her many protégés.         Mrs. Sutherland led the way in the critical rather than sugary descriptive reviewing that accompanied the flourishing of American children's books. She explained the great change in the field of children's books that paralleled her career as the lifting of taboos, most of which reflected a sincere wish to protect children. She accepted children as real and aware individuals and their books as real literature, and she was a stalwart supporter of books that addressed a range of problems and issues that some still find shocking.         In 1963 the psychologically incisive picture book ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' by Maurice Sendak, was controversial in the way it depicted a child's temper tantrum. Mrs. Sutherland found it ''most imaginative and unusual.'' Her 1970 review of Mr. Sendak's ''In the Night Kitchen'' serenely sailed past little Mickey's brief nudity, which so disturbed other reviewers, and described the book as an ''engaging fantasy.''         Mr. Sendak remembered both her criticism and her friendship as ''a magnifying glass.'' He added, ''You couldn't lie or be sappy or ridiculous.''         Of John Donovan's ''I'll Get There. It Better Be Worth the Trip,'' a 1969 novel for young adults that introduced homosexuality as a theme, she said, ''It is not the crux of the story, and it is handled with dignity.'' Similarly, in 1974 she identified Robert Cormier's first novel, ''The Chocolate War,'' now considered a classic, as ''a sobering, dramatic and timeless story.''         Zena Karras was born in Winthrop, Mass., in 1915 and moved with her mother to Chicago after her parents divorced. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1937, married Roland Bailey the same year and had three children. In 1956 she began course work at the Graduate Library School with the vague intention of becoming a medical librarian, took a children's literature course on a whim and was soon asked to take over The Bulletin temporarily.         Mrs. Sutherland also reviewed children's books for The Saturday Review from 1966 to 1972 and for The Chicago Tribune from 1972 to 1984. She taught at the Library School from 1972 to 1986 and served on all the important library and children's book committees, including those for the Newbery and Caldecott Awards.         She succeeded May Hill Arbuthnot as the author of ''Children and Books,'' the basic college text on children's literature, in 1972, and revised it regularly, most recently in 1996.         Her friendship with Scott O'Dell, the author of ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' and other historical novels for children, led to the establishment in 1981 of the $5,000 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, of which she was the permanent chairwoman.         In 1983 a collection of articles in her honor, ''Celebrating Children's Books,'' generated royalties that were used to establish the Zena Sutherland lecture series, now run by the Chicago Public Library and the University of Chicago Lab School.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1961. In 1964 she married Alec Sutherland, a Scot who was then director of broadcasting at the University of Chicago. He died in 1990.         Her survivors include a daughter, Katherine Linehan, a professor of English at Oberlin College; two sons, Stephen Bailey, associate dean and professor of history at Knox College, and Thomas Bailey, a teacher in Hellenbaek, Denmark; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         ''I love reading and I love reviewing,'' Mrs. Sutherland once said in an interview. ''Opening every single package was like Christmas. I have been known to stop in the middle of unpacking a load of books and sit down with one.''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Maia Wojciechowska, an award-winning author of children's books, died on June 13 in Long Branch, N.J. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Oriana Rodman.         Ms. Wojciechowska wrote 19 books, the best-known of which is ''Shadow of a Bull'' (1964), about a young boy in Spain who finds his identity after his father, a bullfighter, dies in the ring. The book won the Newbery Medal in 1965.         The book's authenticity came from the author's own experience. Ernest Hemingway acclaimed her as an expert on bullfighting; she managed to get training with fighting bulls and killed one in the ring in Mexico.         Maia Teresa Wojciechowska was born to Zygmunt Wojciechowski and Zofia Wojciechowska in Warsaw on Aug. 7, 1927. When the Nazis invaded Poland at the outbreak of World War II, the family escaped to southern France and later joined her father, a colonel and chief of staff of the Polish Air Force, in England.         After the war, the family moved to Los Angeles. She entered college in 1945 but dropped out after a year. In 1950 she married the author Selden Rodman, who helped her publish her first book, ''Market Day for Ti André,'' (1952). Their marriage ended in divorce in 1957. Her second marriage, to Richard Larkin, in 1972, ended in divorce the next year.         In addition to writing, Ms. Wojciechowska was a private detective, a translator for Radio Free Europe, a publicity director for Hawthorn Books and a professional tennis player and instructor. In 1975 she started her own publishing company.         She is survived by two daughters, Ms. Rodman, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Leonora Wojciechowska of Garfield, N.J.; and two brothers, Zbigniew, of Laguna Hills, Calif., and Christopher Wojciechowski, of Pebble Beach, Calif.       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''

An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail.         The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers.         Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m. She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of good will to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going. ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own. A 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         While her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-protection organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research. ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955. ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' she said in 1990. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Barbara Scott Preiskel, a lawyer whose career helped break down racial barriers in entertainment law as well as on the numerous corporate boards on which she served, died Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her husband, Robert H. Preiskel, said.         Ms. Preiskel, who grew up in Washington and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945, was the second black woman to graduate from Yale Law School, in 1947.         Barbara Scott was born July 6, 1924, in Washington, the daughter of a real estate broker and a chemistry teacher.         Her decades of membership on charity boards began in 1958 with the Hillcrest Center for Children and ended with the Sept. 11 Fund. She had also been on the boards of the New York Community Trust and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, among many others.         She was a lawyer and executive with the Motion Picture Association of America from 1959 to 1983. She helped Jack Valenti, the president of the association, in a legal effort to overturn state and local censorship laws, many of which sought to ban depictions of interracial relationships, on the ground that such laws violated the First Amendment to the Constitution.         Ms. Preiskel was a director of the Washington Post Company, General Electric, Textron, R. H. Macy & Company and Levi Strauss & Company, among others. She was a trustee of Yale, Wellesley and Tougaloo College in Mississippi. She also was chairwoman of the council of advisers to the Hunter College School of Social Work and an adviser to the N.Y.U. Program on Philanthropy and the Law.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her sons, John, of San Francisco, and Richard, of New York, and a grandson, Malakai, of San Francisco.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, she was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Jane Bancroft Cook, an heir to her family company, Dow Jones & Company, and a member of its board for 36 years, died yesterday morning at her home in Cohasset, Mass., the company announced yesterday.         Mrs. Cook was 90 and had been in failing health for a decade, said a daughter, Martha Robes. She was the largest family shareholder at Dow Jones.         She served on the board of Dow Jones from 1949 to 1985 when its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, grew to wield international influence and the company evolved from a small private enterprise to become a publicly traded, $4 billion media empire.         Mrs. Cook was an active philanthropist, though she preferred to give anonymously, her daughter said.         Roy A. Hammer, a senior partner at the Boston law firm of Hemenway & Barnes and the trustee of many of the family trusts, said yesterday that Mrs. Cook had been intensely interested in the company, particularly its flagship newspaper. She held more shares than any other individual family member, Mr. Hammer said.         ''She was vitally interested in the company and its success and its maintaining its journalistic independence and standard of accuracy in its news reporting,'' he said. ''She was a very dedicated director for a great many years and instilled, particularly in her three daughters, a sense of responsibility for the stewardship of The Wall Street Journal.''         Mrs. Cook was the last of three children of Jane W. W. Bancroft, the stepdaughter of Clarence W. Barron, who bought Dow Jones from its founders in 1902. At his death, Mr. Barron left the company to his stepdaughter. One descendant of each of Jane W. W. Bancroft's children -- Hugh Bancroft Jr. and Jessie Bancroft Cox, who both died years ago, and Mrs. Cook -- now serve on the board.         In a statement released yesterday, Peter R. Kann, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones, said that Mrs. Cook ''was firm on principles, kind to people and ever modest about herself.''         ''Her abiding commitment to editorial integrity and corporate independence,'' Mr. Kann added, ''will continue to guide the company, its management and its owners.''         The company announcement was made minutes after the stock market closed. It stressed that her death ''will not result in any change in voting control of Dow Jones.''         Mr. Hammer said yesterday that the Bancroft heirs controlled about 70 percent of Dow Jones, with most of the shares held in a series of interlocking trusts.         Mrs. Cook gave large sums to institutions throughout New England, from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University to animal shelters, her daughter said. She also helped create New College in Sarasota, Fla., where she had a second home, a residence that she bequeathed to the college, Mr. Hammer said.         In addition to Mrs. Robes, of Round Pond, Me., Mrs. Cook is survived by two other daughters, Jean Stevenson, of Lyme, N.H., and Boca Grande, Fla., and Elizabeth Steele, of Burlington, Vt.; six stepchildren; eight grandchildren; 11 stepgrandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Esphyr Slobodkina, a prominent abstract artist better known for her down-to-earth children's book ''Caps for Sale,'' a tale about a peddler and a band of mischievous monkeys, died on Sunday at her home in Glen Head, N.Y. She was 93.         ''Caps for Sale'' was first published in 1938 and still sells steadily, as generation after generation of children demands that the cheerfully repetitive words be read and reread.         In ''Caps for Sale,'' a cap salesman awakes from a nap to find that monkeys have taken his wares up a tree. He angrily shakes his finger at them, but they respond by shaking their fingers back and saying ''Tsz, tsz, tsz.'' No matter what he does, they imitate him. Finally, in exasperation, the peddler throws down his hat, and the rest is history.         She went on to write and illustrate numerous other books, including ''The Wonderful Feast,'' (1955), ''The Clock'' (1956), ''The Long Island Ducklings'' (1961) and ''Pezzo the Peddler and the Circus Elephant,'' which was first published in 1967 and was reissued this year as ''Circus Caps for Sale.''         The original ''Caps for Sale'' has sold more than two million copies since it was first published, according to Ms. Slobodkina's publisher, HarperCollins. In sales it ranks with such classics as ''Good Night Moon,'' though well below books like ''Pat the Bunny,'' ''The Cat in the Hat'' or ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit,'' according to lists compiled by Publisher's Weekly.         Even as Ms. Slobodkina found success in writing and illustrating books, she continued her paintings, textiles and sculptures. She was a founding member of a group called the American Abstract Artists, established in 1936 to promote the emerging genre, which included artists like Josef Albers, Ad Reinhardt, Ilya Bolotowsky, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and David Smith.         Her work is represented in numerous collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Corcoran Gallery and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.         Reviewing a retrospective of her work at the Kraushaar Galleries in Manhattan earlier this year, Grace Glueck wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Slobodkina's varied works were ''all of a creative piece, and a pleasure to behold.''         Esphyr Slobodkina (the name is pronounced ess-FEER sloh-BOD-kee-nah) was born in the small Siberian town of Cheliabinsk on Sept. 22, 1908, and came to America at 20.         She started in children's books by necessity. During the Depression, she was short on money and worked in her mother's dress shop. A friend introduced her to Margaret Wise Brown, the author of ''Good Night Moon'' at the Bank Street Writers Laboratory in Greenwich Village. Ms. Slobodkina went on to illustrate several of Brown's other books, including, ''The Little Fireman,'' ''The Little Cowboy'' and ''Sleepy ABC'' .         In a memoir published on her Web site, www.slobodkina.com, Ms. Slobodkina wrote, ''When Margaret died, I was left without a writer, and since she always insisted that she liked the way I told my stories, I took a deep breath and began to send them to my agent.''         Ms. Slobodkina married Mr. Bolotowsky, a fellow artist, in 1933. They were divorced three years later. She married William Urquhart in 1960. He died in 1963.         Her survivors include a sister, Tamara Schildkraut, who lived with her in Glen Head; a stepdaughter, Charlotte Van Stolk of Cleveland; and several stepgrandchildren.         Ms. Slobodkina took her responsibility as a children's book author seriously. In her memoir she wrote: ''The verbal patterns and the patterns of behavior we present to children in these lighthearted confections are likely to influence them for the rest of their lives. These aesthetic impressions, just like the moral teachings of early childhood, remain indelible.''       
         Annie Snyder, a leader of efforts to prevent the development of land near the site of the Civil War battles of Bull Run in northern Virginia, died on July 19 in Manassas, Va. She was 80. She and her husband had a farm near the battlefield.         The cause was pneumonia, The Associated Press reported.         By 1988 Mrs. Snyder had been involved, by her count, in six efforts in 30 years to prevent developers from encroaching on what she called the ''hallowed ground'' of the battlefield. She said then that she had lost only one confrontation, when a power company strung lines near the field.         In an interview in The New York Times in 1988, she said, ''When we first moved here it was easy to imagine at night that you heard the creaking of leather saddles as General Longstreet's advanced guards arrived to help Stonewall Jackson as he held on to that railroad embankment over there.''         At the time, she was leading conservationists and Civil War enthusiasts in opposing developers who wanted to build a giant shopping mall next to the battlefield. She also generated backing for her side of the issue in Congress, where legislation was passed to buy and protect the land where the mall was to have been built. The confrontation over the plan for a shopping mall has been called the Third Battle of Bull Run.         Earlier, she had prevailed against federal officials who wanted to rearrange roads near the battlefield. Other victories included helping to thwart plans to build a Great America theme park near the historic site.         In the 1950's she championed civil rights in Virginia and was active in the Republican Party.         Born in Pittsburgh, Anne Delp Snyder attended the University of Pittsburgh's law school. In World War II she was one of the first female officers in the Marine Corps, serving in the United States as a recruiter and a quartermaster.         Her survivors include her husband, Waldon Peter Snyder, known as Pete, a former Marine Corps aviator; six children; six grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.       
         Dr. Alice M. Stewart, an epidemiologist who first demonstrated the link between X-rays of pregnant women and disease in their children, a finding that changed medical practice, died on June 23 in Oxford, England. A resident of the countryside outside Oxford, she was 95.         Dr. Stewart, who became one of the most authoritative critics of the safety of the American nuclear weapons program and a leading proponent of the idea that no level of exposure to radiation is safe, came to prominence in 1956 for her report on prenatal X-rays.         It was an increasingly common practice in the 1950's to X-ray the abdomens of pregnant women to determine the position of their babies, said Dr. Gayle Greene of Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., who wrote ''The Woman Who Knew Too Much: Alice Stewart and the Secrets of Radiation.''         Dr. Stewart, then a member of the social medicine department at Oxford, was surprised to discover when she conducted a survey that children of mothers who had had this X-ray were almost twice as likely to have cancer as other children.         Her finding that there was danger in receiving even such a low dose of radiation was met with outrage by doctors and the nuclear industry, and Dr. Stewart had difficulties obtaining financing for other studies. But by the mid-1970's, other scientists had duplicated her findings on prenatal X-rays, and the practice ended.         In a 1995 interview with The Times Higher Education Supplement, a weekly publication in Britain, she described her problems with financing of studies. ''If I had been a man I would never have stood it; I would have gone,'' she said. ''The prospects were too bad, the pay too low. But being a woman I didn't have all that number of choices.''         Dr. Stewart was also at the center of a 14-year battle with the Department of Energy, which cut off her access to its records on the health of nuclear-weapons workers after she and her colleagues found that low doses of radiation had increased the number of cancers among workers at the Hanford nuclear weapons plant in Washington State.         Congressional pressure, fueled by Dr. Stewart's appearances before a House subcommittee, forced the department to open the records to independent researchers in 1990 and to surrender its monopoly on government financing of radiation research.         More recently, Dr. Stewart devoted her time to arguing that data on Hiroshima survivors, the main source for standards on the safe levels of radiation exposure, was deeply flawed and underestimated radiation's harmful effects.         She was born Alice Mary Naish in Sheffield, England. Her mother, Lucy Wellburn Naish, was one of the first British women to become a doctor, and four of the Naish children became doctors as well.         After earning a medical degree at Cambridge, Dr. Stewart joined Oxford in 1941 and studied workers who filled shells with TNT at munition plants. Her conclusions that exposure to TNT impaired the body's ability to form blood led Britain to change its manufacturing techniques.         Dr. Stewart left Oxford in 1974, and became a research fellow at the University of Birmingham in England, where she worked until about two years ago.         Her marriage to Ludovick Stewart ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Anne Marshall of London, who is a doctor, and four grandchildren.       
         Ghity Lindenbaum Stern, whose philanthropy benefited educational institutions in the United States and Israel, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Mrs. Stern had been honorary chairman of the board of directors of Yeshiva University's Stern College for Women. It was founded with a donation from her husband, Max Stern, whom she married in 1950.         Mr. Stern was founder and chairman of the board of the Hartz Mountain Products Corporation, a philanthropist and a fund-raiser for Jewish education. He was president of the Jewish Center, a synagogue in Manhattan, for 45 years until he died in 1982.         Mrs. Stern was one of the founders of the Manhattan Day School. She was also a supporter of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.         Ghity Amiel was born in Lithuania and married Nathan Lindenbaum in 1928. She fled Hitler's forces and traveled to New York City with Mr. Lindenbaum and four children in 1940 from Antwerp, where her father, Moshe Avigdor Amiel, was chief rabbi before he became chief rabbi of Tel Aviv. She lived in New York City the rest of her life.         Mr. Lindenbaum died in 1946. Two of her sons, Henry Lindenbaum and Stanley Stern, also died before her.         She is survived by five children, all residents of the New York area: two daughters, Maidy Jeger and Gloria Kisch; three sons, Armand and Marcel Lindenbaum and Leonard Stern; 24 grandchildren and 37 great-grandchildren; and two sisters, Esther Mann of Tel Aviv and Sully Selbourn of Manchester, England.       
         Dolores Olmedo Patiño, the combative Mexican art collector who turned her hacienda into a museum devoted to paintings by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, died in Mexico City on Saturday. Her age was a matter of debate, but she used a birth date that would make her 88.         Mrs. Olmedo amassed 137 works by Rivera and 25 by his wife, Kahlo, and for decades controlled the estates of these Mexican artists. Although Mrs. Olmedo eventually opened her collection to the public, she was denounced by her critics for delays in inaugurating the museum and for her reluctance for many years to give art experts and biographers ready access to the works and archives of Rivera and Kahlo.         But the diminutive Mrs. Olmedo, who once modeled for Diego Rivera, welcomed controversy as an opportunity to move from the margins of Mexican cultural history to center stage. Her stubbornness was vindicated when her Museo Dolores Olmedo Patiño, on the southern outskirts of Mexico City, was judged an artistic success.         Mrs. Olmedo loved flaunting her independence. Once asked how she would like to be remembered, she replied: ''Just as I am -- a woman who did whatever she felt like doing, and luckily succeeded at it.''         Born in Mexico City on Dec. 14, 1913, Dolores Olmedo was 17 when an encounter cast her destiny. She accompanied her mother, a schoolteacher, to the Ministry of Education, where they had a chance exchange in an elevator with Rivera, then a renowned artist in his 40's working on murals in the building.         ''He asked my mother if he could make some drawings of me,'' Mrs. Olmedo recalled. ''She agreed without knowing that I would pose nude.''         Rivera made 27 drawings of the young woman and gave them to her. Years later, her husband, Howard S. Phillips, an American publisher in Mexico, discovered them and ordered her to return them to Rivera. When Rivera was dying in the mid-1950's, Mrs. Olmedo, by then divorced and wealthy, put him up in her home and helped care for him. A grateful Rivera, whose reputation and earnings had tumbled, again gave her the nude drawings. He also sold her scores of his paintings and many works by Kahlo, who had died in 1954. Before his own death in 1957, Rivera designated Mrs. Olmedo to administer his and Kahlo's estates.         As the artists' reputations -- and the prices for their work -- rebounded, art critics and intellectuals began to resent Mrs. Olmedo's huge hoard of Riveras and Kahlos and her power over the artists' legacies. She was accused of having grossly underpaid for her collection. Stories swirled that a jealous Mrs. Olmedo was intent on sabotaging Kahlo's legacy.         ''I was never a friend of Frida Kahlo,'' Mrs. Olmedo conceded in an interview with The New York Times, in which she referred to the artist's bisexuality. ''Frida Kahlo liked women. I liked men.''         She said that she bought her 25 Kahlo paintings -- for which she paid only $1,600 -- because Rivera begged her to do so to make sure that an important part of his wife's work remained in Mexico under one roof. ''Otherwise I would not have done it,'' Mrs. Olmedo said.         Fewer than 200 Kahlo paintings survive, and Mrs. Olmedo's collection is the most significant private holding of her works.         Critics agreed that she owned some of the most highly regarded Kahlo paintings. Mrs. Olmedo ''has Kahlo's gritty, ferocious paintings -- the kind no one else could have painted,'' said Hayden Herrera, the author of ''Frida,'' a 1983 biography.         Mrs. Olmedo had little regard for Kahlo as an artist, and in several interviews referred to her works as ''trashy.'' Her estimation of Rivera, on the other hand, was uncritical. ''I will always defend his work energetically, while I'm alive and even after I die,'' she wrote in her museum's catalog.         Mrs. Olmedo's collection included dozens of little-known early works by Rivera done in post-Impressionist and Cubist styles. She also owned highly acclaimed paintings from Rivera's later period, including ''La Tehuana'' (1955), a portrait of Mrs. Olmedo wearing the colorful dress of a native of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; Kahlo often wore such a costume. But she also had many of his least memorable works, like saccharine portraits of Russian children that look like Soviet propaganda.         Mrs. Olmedo became the major collector of Riveras as well as Rivera's benefactor late in his life, thanks to her entrepreneurial acumen. After divorcing in the 1940's, she became one of the first Mexican women to succeed in real estate development. The business brought her into contact with leading industrialists and politicians, and fueled rumors, vigorously denied by Mrs. Olmedo, linking her romantically to several Mexican presidents.         Mrs. Olmedo was married and divorced three times. She is survived by four children from her first marriage, to Mr. Phillips. She also had 14 grandchildren.         In the early 1990's Mrs. Olmedo was accused of deliberately shutting down the Frida Kahlo Museum, also in Mexico City, for two years, under the guise of doing renovations in the building, once Kahlo's home. Mrs. Olmedo declined to explain the long museum closing. Friends suggested that the government was at fault for failing to cover the rather modest renovation costs as it was supposed to, but that Mrs. Olmedo refused to make any public statements that might hurt her political relationships or cast her as too stingy to foot the bill.         Similar reasons seem to have postponed the opening of Mrs. Olmedo's own museum for more than five years. In the mid-1980's she announced that with Mexican government backing she would convert her 16th-century Spanish colonial hacienda in Xochimilco, at the southern end of Mexico City, into a museum and then donate her collection for permanent display there.         During the renovations, the architects discovered that half the building was slowly sinking into its watery foundations and that the roof and walls were leaking.         Eventually, the government paid the renovation costs, and in late 1994 the museum opened. Even then many critics lambasted Mrs. Olmedo for displaying her collection according to her quirky tastes.         ''I lived with this art for most of my life,'' Mrs. Olmedo said. ''Who knows better than me how it should be displayed?''       
         Quail Hawkins, the author of gentle children's books like ''A Puppy for Keeps,'' and ''Mark, Mark, Shut the Door,'' both popular in the 1940's, died on Aug. 16 at the retirement home where she lived in Pacific Grove, Calif. She was 97.         Miss Hawkins wrote nine books and edited or was co-author of numerous others. Her work ranged from ''beginning to read'' picture books to chapter books for young adults and included several collections of prayers, animal tales and verse.         All her books were illustrated, usually with boys and girls in motion, often with pets, mothers in aprons and fathers in jackets, ties and hats. Among the illustrators she worked with were Kurt Wiese, Marguerite de Angeli and Phyllis Coté.         She was also a specialist in children's literature. She worked at bookstores and publishing houses and encouraged the work of authors like Beverly Cleary and Ursula K. Le Guin. In Ms. Cleary's memoir, ''My Own Two Feet,'' she wrote how in 1941 Ms. Hawkins hired her to work during the Christmas rush at Sather Gate Book Shop in Berkeley, Calif. She described Ms. Hawkins, then the manager of children's books at the store, as ''a rapid, omnivorous reader with a retentive memory, a love of books and a passion for persuading others to read them.'' That first job -- and Ms. Hawkins's encouragement -- led to Ms. Cleary's first book contract, she wrote.         Miss Hawkins spent more than 30 years at the Sather Gate shop, which was a major supplier of books for schools and libraries. Miss Hawkins traveled extensively through Northern California for the store. She also served for seven years as a children's book specialist at the University of California Press.         Quail Hawkins, the oldest of seven children, was born Helena Ann Hawkins on March 29, 1905, in Spokane, Wash. No one in the family today is sure how she came to be called Quail, said a nephew, Mark Hawkins, but the name stuck. Her father was a fruit wholesaler and her mother a columnist for a local newspaper, The Spokane Register.         According to family lore, Quail became a storyteller because she spent so much time caring for her younger brothers, especially after her father's death at an early age. Ms. Hawkins never married and is survived only by nieces and nephews.         Among her books are ''Prayers and Graces for Small Children'' (Grosset & Dunlap, 1941), and several books for Holiday House, including, ''A Puppy For Keeps'' (1943), ''Don't Run, Apple'' (1944), ''Mark, Mark, Shut the Door'' (1947) and ''The Aunt-Sitter'' (1958). None of the books are still in print. Only one of them, ''A Puppy For Keeps,'' was listed for sale yesterday on amazon.com.       
         Helen Matthew Robinson, the matriarch of the family that in 1864 bought the Hawaiian island of Niihau and then so zealously guarded its privacy that it is the only one of the islands where Hawaiian is still spoken as an everyday language, died on July 31 at her home in Makaweli, on the island of Kauai. She was 91.         Though Mrs. Robinson herded cattle at 65, climbed trees at 75 and drove until she was 85, her health had gradually deteriorated in recent years, her son Keith said. She finally had to relinquish decision making concerning the island, which she had assumed in 1969 with the death of her husband, Lester.         Keith Robinson said his mother's influence lived on in the indigenous people who still speak Hawaiian and in the population of rare monk seals on the coastline. Both are results of so severely restricting access to Niihau that it is known as ''the forbidden isle.''         Niihau (pronounced nee-ee-HOW), the seventh-largest Hawaiian island, is 69.5 square miles and is 17 miles southwest of Kauai. Geologically the oldest of the Hawaiian islands, it is considered the home of the volcano goddess Pele, according to legend. Niihau was the only Hawaiian island to vote against statehood in 1959.         The 200 or so residents collect delicate shells to make leis that sell for thousands of dollars. The islanders also work on the Robinsons' sheep and cattle ranch in return for salaries, free housing, food and education for their children. Their daily life seems a throwback to the misty Hawaiian past. There is no electricity or indoor plumbing -- rain is collected in buckets. There are no paved roads, and conversations are conducted in the lilting native language, though Mr. Robinson said that more English words were creeping in.         Guns and alcohol are forbidden, and the Robinsons will not bring tobacco on the weekly supply barge. The residents can be evicted at any time and have no contractual rights.         Mrs. Robinson herself tended to minimize the uniqueness of Niihau, even as she fought to preserve it.         ''It's just a little cattle ranch we operate in our own way,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1970. ''There's nothing sensational about it. I don't see why everyone is so interested in it.''         The story of the Robinsons and the island begins in Edinburgh with Eliza Hutchinson, the widow of a Scottish sea captain, Francis Sinclair. With some of her children and their spouses, Mrs. Sinclair eventually went to the Sandwich Islands, as Hawaii was then known.         There she met the ruler of Hawaii, King Kamehameha IV, who offered her several parcels of land, including one that stretched from what became downtown Honolulu to Diamond Head in Waikiki. She turned it down in order to buy an entire island, paying $10,000 in gold in 1864.         As he signed the contract, the king said: ''Niihau is yours. But the day may come when Hawaiians are not as strong in Hawaii as they are now. When that day comes, please do what you can to help them.''         The family, who were strict Calvinists, required all residents of the island to attend Congregational church services on Sunday. (It was an easy sell: missionaries had converted them to Christianity 40 years before.) At first, visitors were permitted, though scarce water supplies began to limit invitations.         From the beginning, Mrs. Sinclair and her heirs sought to protect the indigenous culture. They also remained close to the royal family and opposed the American overthrow in 1893, after which the provisional government forbade use of the Hawaiian language.         Keith Robinson said the family totally cut off visits to Niihau in the 1930's because of the vulnerability of people to diseases to which they had never been exposed like measles, which had killed 11 children on the island.         Lester Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's husband, was the great-grandson of Eliza Hutchinson. He grew up in the family compound in the Makaweli District of Kauai, where Mrs. Sinclair had bought more property.         Helen Marion Matthew was born on Aug. 2, 1910, in Washington, D.C., which her family was visiting. She grew up in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of California.         Her aunt, a tutor to Lester Robinson when he was a boy, arranged a visit to the Robinsons in 1935, and a reluctant Lester was asked in advance to look after Helen. Rather than the dreaded child in pigtails he expected to meet, she turned out to be an attractive, friendly woman in her mid-20's. Keith Robinson said he had always heard it was love at first sight, though the two were not married until 1937.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Robinson rejected numerous offers for the island, including a large one from Japanese interests. The only intrusions she permitted were tourist helicopter flights overhead and secret military activities, which were kept away from both endangered wildlife and residents.         Keith Robinson said he and his brother, Bruce, had no intention of changing anything on the island, much less selling it. Mrs. Robinson is also survived by seven grandchildren.         In 1983, she wrote a letter to a researcher in which she chose one word to describe her vision of Niihau: ''seclusivity.'' It is not in the dictionary, but her meaning was apparent.       
         Diane J. Lipton, who fought for the rights of her disabled daughter and went on to become a lawyer and prominent advocate for children with disabilities, died on Aug. 8 at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 57.         The cause was a rare form of lung cancer, her husband, James Armstrong, said.         Her daughter Chloe had cerebral palsy and developmental delays. In 1979, when Chloe was 7, the Richmond Unified School District reduced her occupational training sessions to one a week from three. Ms. Lipton and other parents demanded that the school district restore the sessions and change its complaint procedures.         By the time the battle ended in 1987, Ms. Lipton had won what she and other advocates considered a major civil rights battle. The district had closed its four schools for pupils with disabilities and integrated them into regular schools.         Her winning tactic had been persuading federal officials in Washington to temporarily cut off money for the education of disabled children in all California schools until the Richmond situation was remedied.         The result was a new state policy to end the segregation of disabled children. Ms. Lipton took the issue a step further in 1990 when she and other advocates for the disabled took the Sacramento school district to court to demand the mixing of disabled children into regular classrooms.         In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco decided the case in Ms. Lipton's favor and defined standards for judging whether school districts were complying with the 1975 federal law requiring that disabled students be educated to the maximum extent possible and with other children as much as possible.         Diane Julie Zelman was born on June 13, 1945, in Forest Hills, Queens, where she grew up. She graduated from the University of California with an English major and experience in many campus demonstrations. She married Lennie Lipton, a campus activist and co-writer of the song ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''         In 1972, Chloe was born, the only one of triplets to survive. Ms. Lipton became friendly with parents of other disabled children, and Chloe at 3 began to attend a school for orthopedically handicapped children. In 1974, Ms. Lipton began a master's-degree course in rehabilitation counseling at San Francisco State University, graduating in 1976.         She divorced around 1979. Within two years, she had become a parent advocate with the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund and was organizing a statewide campaign to integrate the Richmond schools, traveling to Washington to press for the cutoff in money. At night, she earned a law degree at Golden Gate University.         In 1980, she married Mr. Armstrong, whom she had met at a union meeting for rehabilitation workers.         Her passion in the initial battle was fueled by a chain-link fence that separated Chloe's special education school from what was considered a conventional school. The only time the students were allowed to mingle was on Halloween, when they were in costume. Ms. Lipton thought this indicated that school officials regarded disabled students as freaks, Arlene Mayerson, a lawyer for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, said.         Ms. Lipton is survived by her husband; Chloe, who, with some help, lives on her own in Emeryville, Calif.; and a daughter from her second marriage, Daria Armstrong.       
         Nancy Chaffee Whitaker, a leading tennis player in the 1950's who won three consecutive national indoor championships, died Sunday in Coronado, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Indian Wells, Calif.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her husband, the sportscaster Jack Whitaker.         In the early 50's, Nancy Chaffee vied for tennis supremacy with figures like Maureen Connolly, Althea Gibson, Margaret Osborne duPont, Doris Hart, Louise Brough and Shirley Fry.         She was the national indoor titleholder from 1950 to 1952, defeating Gibson, Beverly Baker and Patricia Todd in the finals, long before the open era and the advent of huge prize money. The indoor tournaments were played on the boards at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan before perhaps 2,000 fans at the final rounds.         ''What did I win?'' Chaffee Whitaker said in a 1993 interview. ''A little silver ball and a silver ashtray with a glass base, and I don't even smoke. No money.''         Comparing the modern game with her era, she said: ''There are more better players. When I was playing I was an automatic almost into the semifinals of any tournament. That's just the way it was, a gap between the few top players and the rest. And there was no qualifying for tournaments.''         The daughter of a tennis instructor and a native of Ventura, Calif., she played on the men's tennis team at the University of Southern California because there was no women's squad. While a sophomore, she captured the 1947 United States girls' lawn tennis singles championship and teamed with Baker to win the doubles title.         She emerged in the national spotlight in 1950, reaching the singles quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the singles semifinals of the United States nationals -- the forerunner of the United States Open -- in addition to winning the first of her indoor championships.         In 1951, she teamed with Todd in doubles at the nationals, losing in the final to Fry and Hart, and she played doubles on the 1951 Wightman Cup team that defeated Britain, 6-1.         She was married in October 1951 to Ralph Kiner, the Pittsburgh Pirates' slugger and future Hall of Famer, and retired from most tournament play after winning the 1952 indoor title, devoting herself to rearing a family.         She was later a sports commentator for ABC, developed tennis programs at resorts and helped found the Cartier tennis tournament in Long Island's Hamptons to benefit the American Cancer Society.         In addition to Whitaker, whom she married in 1991, she is survived by three children from her marriage to Kiner, the longtime Mets broadcaster; sons Michael and Scott Kiner, and a daughter, Kathryn Freeman, all of Palm Desert, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Lucia Pamela, a one-of-a-kind entertainer best known for recording a music album in 1969 about her fictional travels to the moon, died on July 25 in a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 98.         Until 1992, Ms. Pamela's only album, ''Into Outer Space With Lucia Pamela,'' was all but forgotten. Irwin Chusid, a radio disc jockey, helped revive her career and produced a reissue of her album. When a small independent label, Arf Arf, reissued it on CD that year, record collectors around the world took note. Not only were the homemade lyrics and songs unusual and full of infectious childlike optimism and sincerity (she truly believed she had gone to the moon), but her background was equally compelling.         Ms. Pamela's story is a mixture of fact and self-invention. She claimed, for example, to be the first person ever on television and radio; that Ignace Paderewski told her mother she would be the finest pianist in the world; that she was kicked out of a German music conservatory for being overqualified. Relatives said there were grains of truth in all these stories.         Ms. Pamela was born in St. Louis, and her mother was a concert pianist and composer. In 1926, Ms. Pamela won the title of Miss St. Louis. After performing in St. Louis theaters, she moved to Fresno, Calif., where she managed the Fresno Storyland amusement park (she also played Mother Goose there). She was also the host of two radio shows for young women, ''The Encouragement Hour'' and ''Gal About Town.''         Ms. Pamela formed what some say was the country's first all-female orchestra, Lucia Pamela and the Musical Pirates, in which she claimed to have played 15 instruments. With her daughter, Georgia, she formed the vocal duo the Pamela Sisters. Nowadays her daughter, Georgia Frontiere, is best known as the owner of the St. Louis Rams. Ms. Pamela married several times, the last time to Billy Angelo, a professional prizefighter, who died in 1987.         Ms. Pamela is also survived by a son, Ken Irwin of Palm Springs, Calif.; 12 grandchildren; and 27 great-grandchildren.         A documentary on her life is being completed by Danielle Lemaire, a Belgian artist.         One of Ms. Pamela's proudest accomplishments, she liked to say, was building a rocket, touring the Milky Way and stopping on the moon to record her album. With the feel of a warped bebop children's album, it features Ms. Pamela on all instruments -- piano, accordion, drums, clarinet, and probably various household appliances -- accompanying herself as she tells, with gee-whiz glee, tales of amiable lunar roosters, trips to Mars and blue winds. At 65, she sang of a world where anything was possible and everything was shot through with an innocent joy, excitement and imagination.         The album was released in 1969 on a small label, Gulfstream, and signed copies are said to fetch as much as $1,000. She also created a coloring book that tells the story of a moon trip in which she met cows, Indians and anthropomorphic cashews. ''Some of the people there spoke Almond,'' she wrote.         A tireless entertainer, Ms. Pamela was cited by ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for having memorized some 10,000 songs. The English band Stereolab even wrote a song about her, ''International Colouring Contest.'' She performed at Las Vegas hotels into her 80's.         ''It was recorded on Moontown,'' Ms. Pamela said of her album. ''I was the only one from Earth there.''       
         Doris Wishman, a prolific independent director of truly tasteless movies -- from nudist camp romps to the cult classic ''Bad Girls Go to Hell'' -- died on Aug. 10 in Miami. She lived in Coral Gables, Fla.         She never revealed her age, but her passport carried a date of birth of April 23, 1920, making her 82, said Michael Bowen, who is writing her biography. He said family members believe she was around 90.         Miss Wishman has been called the female Ed Wood, the legendary director of ''B'' movies. She wrote, produced, cast, directed and edited around 30 films, including several she made under pseudonyms. She rarely spent more than $70,000 on a picture, usually beginning by begging her sister Pearl Kushner, who also lives in Coral Gables and is her only immediate survivor, for startup money.         Joe Bob Briggs, the drive-in movie critic, called her ''the greatest female exploitation director in history.''         She often said she did not like her movies, but she clearly enjoyed making them. The title of Mr. Bowen's biography is ''It's Better Than Sex,'' a phrase she often applied to filmmaking. Her work, which had faded from view in the 1980's, made a resurgence after being featured at the Harvard University Film Archive in 1994.         She was born in Manhattan, and her mother died when she was a young child. Her father, who sold hay and grain, and his six children then moved to Westchester County. Miss Wishman took some courses at Hunter College and studied acting.         She took a job as a secretary and movie booker in a relative's film distribution business. She married an advertising executive, Jack Abrahms, and moved to Florida; he died a few years later.         In her grief she wanted work that would occupy all of her waking time. She decided she could produce independent films as well as distribute them, and hit upon the idea of making films about nudist camps. Recent court rulings had removed them from censorship.         She made a total of eight, including ''Blaze Starr Goes Nudist,'' the only feature film starring the burlesque queen (as herself).         ''Nude on the Moon,'' in which astronauts are greeted by naked women with pipe-cleaner antennas poking out of their bouffant hairdos, was banned in New York State. The censor board at the time allowed only films about nudist colonies, turning aside her argument that it was about a nudist camp on the moon.         In her next phase, she made sexual melodramas in which women were depicted as tragic heroines being exploited by men. There was nudity and plenty of violence against women but no explicit sex. In the grainy black-and-white pictures, which included titles like ''A Taste of Flesh,'' she defined a quirky personal style: bizarre cutaways to ashtrays, lamps and squirrels; suggestive lesbian subplots and gratuitous nudity and violence.         By the early 1970's, court decisions allowed and audiences demanded more explicit pornographic films. She made several, but left the room when sex scenes were being shot.         ''She was actually rather sexually naïve,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''She personally thought someone's hand caressing your face was more erotic than sex itself.''         Her big successes in the 1970's were two films starring Chesty Morgan, named for her commanding physical endowments. The movies had scant sex and very little nudity.         Miss Wishman wanted to make ''slasher'' films like ''Friday the 13th,'' but she lacked the money and technical skills. But in 1989, ''A Night to Dismember'' was finally released.         She had moved back to New York after the death of her husband and married again in 1966, a man she referred to only as Lou in interviews. The marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970's.         She moved back to Florida in the late 1980's and was working in a lingerie store when interest in her work, which was readily available on video, began its resurgence. Her last movie, ''Each Time I Kill,'' will probably be released later this year, Mr. Bowen said.         He said that despite the raciness of her films she herself claimed little sexual experience.         ''I've had two husbands and a lover, and that's my quota,'' she said.       
         Marjorie Slaiman, the longtime costume designer for the Arena Stage theater company in Washington, died on Sept. 13 at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 77 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications from heart surgery, her family said.         In her 26-year career with Arena Stage Ms. Slaiman designed thousands of costumes for more than 130 productions, including the 1967 premiere of ''The Great White Hope'' with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, which alone required more than 230 costumes.         She also worked on Arena Stage's productions of ''Our Town'' and ''Inherit the Wind,'' which both toured the Soviet Union in 1973.         Her credits on Broadway include Arthur Kopit's ''Indians,'' Studs Terkel's ''Working'' and Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God.'' Ms. Slaiman won the first Helen Hayes Award for her costume design for ''Man and Superman'' in 1985 and was nominated for seven more Hayes awards before her retirement in 1993.         Born Marjorie Lawler in the Bronx, she graduated from the New York School of Industrial Art and got her start designing lingerie in New York and costumes for the Shakespeare Theater Festival in Washington during the 1960's.         She is survived by four children, Gary, of McLean, Va.; Donald, of Columbus, Ohio; Lauren, of Manhattan; and Tracey Barrentine of Annandale, Va.; five brothers, John Lawler of Yonkers; Lawrence Lawler of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; Robert Lawler of Seaford, N.Y.; Brendan Lawler, of Katonah, N.Y.; and James Lawler, of Staten Island; four sisters, Therese Lawler Stevenson of Bedford, N.Y.; Kathleen Lawler Gerard of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y.; Patricia Lawler Odell of Parlin, N.J.; and Joan Lawler Cirone of San Luis Obispo, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Joan Littlewood, the producer, director and author who was one of the most important and original figures responsible for the regeneration of the British theater in the 1950's and 60's, died Friday in London at the home of her assistant. She was 87.         Ms. Littlewood's Theater Workshop, based in a shabby old playhouse in a poor section of East London, won an international reputation with seasons of offbeat work that she staged by herself. These included ''Oh What a Lovely War,'' a vaudeville-style re-creation of key events in the First World War; ''The Quare Fellow'' and ''The Hostage,'' two plays by her protégé, the Irish dramatist Brendan Behan; and ''A Taste of Honey,'' a bleak portrait of life in Northern England by the 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney.         As early as 1956 the critic Harold Hobson could declare that Theater Workshop was known throughout Europe as ''England's premier company.''         As much as the kitchen-sink drama of John Osborne and others, which started to appear the same year, Joan Littlewood was responsible for what she called ''the destruction of complacent, well-behaved middle-class theater.''         She demonstrated to the British that lively work could be produced on a shoestring, that tight-knit ensembles were likely to produce better work than ad hoc casts, and that performers and dramatists did not need to suppress their working-class identities in order to succeed.         ''Theater should be grand, vulgar, simple, pathetic,'' Ms. Littlewood said, but ''not genteel, not poetical.''         It was her exuberant energy and feisty informality that once provoked Laurence Olivier to remark ruefully: ''I wish I could work that way. But I'm a trained parrot.''         Joan Maud Littlewood was born in London in 1914, the daughter of a 16-year-old unmarried housemaid. School trips to the Old Vic, and in particular to John Gielgud's performance as Hamlet, bred in her a love of the theater and she won a coveted scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. But she was very much the Cockney outsider in a school she later described as being full of ''debs and rich Americans acquiring English accents.'' She dropped out and made her way, mostly on foot, to the northern city of Manchester, where she got a job in a local repertory theater.         She quickly decided, however, that ''curtain theater'' was not for her. An instinctive radicalism, combined with habitual restlessness, impelled her toward theater work in which, as she later wrote, everything was created by the actors on a bare platform: ''tempest, sun and rain, rivers, storm-tossed seas.''         With Jimmy Miller, who wrote plays under the name of Ewan McColl and was to become her husband, she formed an agitprop group in Manchester called Theater of Action and then created a company called Theater Union, which introduced the British to the American concept called the Living Newspaper, improvisations based on the day's news. After the war this evolved into Theater Workshop, which toured with plays of social or political significance both in Britain and on the Continent.         The company's reputation grew, but its finances remained shaky, provoking George Bernard Shaw to tell Ms. Littlewood that her company ''should all go and be stockbrokers -- the English don't want art.'' The actors paid for one tour by picking tomatoes in the country and selling them at a profit in Manchester.         Tiring of squalid surroundings, Ms. Littlewood decided in 1953 to settle her players in the Theater Royal, a dilapidated Victorian playhouse in the area of London described in Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' as Stratford-atte-Bowe, but now simply known as Stratford East. This caused a permanent breach with Mr. Miller, who feared the move to London would compromise the company's radicalism, and was itself financially risky.         For many months the actors slept in hammocks in the auditorium, shared what little box-office income there was and seldom earned more than $3 a week each. For this they were also expected to paint, decorate and clean the theater as well as perform.         Even in the 1960's, when the theater was internationally renowned, Ms. Littlewood herself was to be found washing the steps before opening nights, reportedly snapping at one passing actor, ''I'm expecting company -- what about you?'' That hospitality and lack of pretension found its way into productions that combined simple staging and dramatic gusto with a determination to break down the conventional barriers between actors and audiences.         Spectators might find themselves directly addressed by characters. There was so much good-natured improvisation that the company was prosecuted for breaching censorship laws, which remained in force in Britain until 1968. Evenings would often end with cheerful gatherings in the theater bar, maybe with Behan or another maverick orchestrating the fun.         Ms. Littlewood met Behan after his incongruously exuberant attack on capital punishment, ''The Quare Fellow'' landed in an inky, tattered bundle on her desk in 1956. She helped him radically revise it, transferred it from Stratford to the West End and so thoroughly took control of his career that he once described himself as ''a creature of Joan's imagination.''         She said she was on the floor, holding Behan's legs to his chair, while he gave a notoriously incoherent, drunken interview in the BBC studios. She also calmed the police when they brought him to the Theater Royal after finding him at the wheel of a ferry on the Thames, saying he was crossing the Missouri. Later she took Behan's Irish Republican Army play, ''The Hostage,'' to the West End and on to New York. But she was unable to stem the drinking that was to kill him in 1964 while he was working on his final piece for the Theater Royal, ''Richard's Cork Leg.''         Among the other plays Ms. Littlewood edited into dramatic shape was ''A Taste of Honey,'' about a white Lancashire girl who becomes pregnant after an affair with a black sailor. The manuscript was sent to her by the teenage Shelagh Delaney with this note: ''I am sending this play to you for your opinion. Would you please return it to me, as whatever sort of theatrical atrocity it is to you it means something to me.''         Ms. Littlewood put the play into rehearsal within two weeks, and it had its first performance at the Theater Royal in May 1958. It went on to the West End and Broadway, providing personal triumphs for Joan Plowright, who played the girl onstage, and Rita Tushingham, who played her in Tony Richardson's 1961 film.         The improvised ''Oh What A Lovely War,'' which brought Theater Workshop its greatest success, was a satire of World War I done in 1963 as a music hall revue with the actors in black-and-white commedia dell'arte costumes. It was later staged on Broadway and made into an all-star film in 1969 by Richard Attenborough. ''Oh What a Lovely War'' used war records, memoirs, speeches and the beloved songs of the Great War -- among them ''Pack Up Your Troubles,'' ''It's a Long Way to Tipperary,'' and ''Keep the Home Fires Burning'' -- to, as Ms. Littlewood put it, ''mock the absurdity, the vulgarity of war.''         She also gave William Saroyan's ''Sam, the Highest Jumper of Them All'' its world premiere, enjoyed success with Wolf Mankowitz's ''Make Me an Offer'' and the ex-convict Frank Norman's ''Fings Ain't What They Used to Be,'' and discovered talent that ranged from John Bury, later the National Theater's head of design, to Richard Harris, who played Macbeth for her.         Though she was best known for staging new work, she directed many classic plays, usually in a rough style that emphasized their immediacy and topicality.         ''If I have to choose between the gods and the clowns, I'll take the clowns,'' Ms. Littlewood once said. ''They're close to the commedia dell'arte and that's what I'm trying to get close to. There's so much nonsense about theater being this or that. Who needs a National Theater? We've already got enough museums.'' She continued: ''My idea is to open doors, to create a community, a meeting place. My doors are open to anyone, to any prostitute or gangster.''         In ''Joan's Book,'' her autobiography, published in 1994, she described herself as ''plain, moody, often amusing sometimes.'' She was known for being tough, combative, ribald and generous. In the words of Philip Hedley, the current director of the Theater Royal, she ''loved conflict, enjoyed provoking, and could demolish people -- and then make them a meal in the green room.''         Though she never married Gerry Raffles, Theater Workshop's general manager, he became her partner and the most significant person in her life. After his death in 1975 she left London for France, where she lived as a recluse. That ended her much-publicized plan to build a ''fun palace'' in East London where people from backgrounds like her own might join in cultural activities of every kind.         She left no immediate survivors. As experimental theater groups sprung up all over London and all around the world, she once said, as The Guardian reported in its obituary: ''I didn't need to have children. All over the world I have children.''       
         Mollie Wilmot, the socialite with the oversize white sunglasses who rose to celebrity in 1984 when a tanker ran aground at her Palm Beach, Fla., mansion, died on Sept. 17 at her apartment in Manhattan.         She was always reluctant to give her age, and ages from 73 to 78 have been reported. The Times Union of Albany, which regularly noted her attendance -- and choice of jewels -- at horse races in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said longtime friends estimated that she was in her early 80's.         Paul Wilmot, a former husband, guessed 73 was closer. At least that is what she told him.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Mrs. Wilmot had no children, and her sole immediate survivor is her sister, Francice Bushkin, of Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Wilmot rose to prominence the day after Thanksgiving in 1984, when a maid awakened her. Madame had callers to her one-acre oceanfront estate, next door to the estate of Rose Kennedy on North Ocean Boulevard Drive.         ''I thought it was the man who was coming to photograph my home for Town and Country,'' she said in an interview in The New York Times.         Instead, in a town that reveres privacy, it was visitors who arrived unannounced -- something frequent visitors like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor just would not do.         ''Let's have coffee first,'' Mrs. Wilmot said with a sigh.         She finally padded out to the patio in her dressing gown to find a 197-foot Venezuelan freighter pounding her seawall into concrete chips. A freak tropical storm had driven the ship, a rust bucket named the Mercedes, hard against her wall.         She overcame her dread of escaping Venezuelan rats and served finger sandwiches, caviar and coffee to the crew of 10, and martinis to the journalists who showed up.         She also fed the ship's cat, which the crew later gave to her. The cat, by then known as Mollie Mercedes, was passed on to her neighbors, the Pulitzer family, who sent it to the beauty parlor for a thorough fluffing and then outfitted it in velvet collars decorated with gold.         Such trappings were typical of the Palm Beach way of life that Mrs. Wilmot had known since she bought her mansion in the early 1960's. She brought her touch to the house, covering the walls of the grand drawing room with leopard-print fabric and laying the skins of lions and zebras on the gleaming floors. She displayed oceans of flowers, always white. Her own elegant, sometimes ostentatious, costumes also had a decidedly personal signature, particularly those sunglasses.         Soon after her purchase, Mrs. Wilmot was forced to put up with Secret Service agents who overran her property to protect her neighbor, President John F. Kennedy. The agents were less of a bother than a large boat in the backyard. But still.         Mollie Netcher was born in Chicago. She was named after her grandmother, who began as a clerk and underwear buyer in the family store and became known as ''the merchant princess of State Street.'' Her parents, Charles and Gladys, inherited the business, the Boston Store.         Mrs. Wilmot graduated from the Foxcroft School. She was married to and divorced from Eddie Bragno, a wine merchant who is now dead; Albert Bostwick, of the polo family; and Mr. Wilmot, a fashion publicity agent.         She exuberantly moved from charities, particularly ones related to dancing and horses, to art auctions. Her philanthropy included the New York City Ballet, the National Museum of Racing, the National Museum of Dance and equine research at the Veterinary College of Cornell University.         Her most dramatic moment occurred when the ramshackle freighter visited her. Helicopters carrying cameramen buzzed overhead for months, after it turned out that the ship's owner was bankrupt and it was stuck.         Palm Beach residents became nightly visitors, sipping cocktails and offering tongue-in-cheek suggestions on what Mrs. Wilmot might do about her problem. A bar had Mollie Wilmot look-alike contests, and many customers wore blond wigs and large white-framed sunglasses. Mrs. Wilmot judged.         After she had waited more than a month for the Mercedes to be removed, which turned out to be just a third of its stay, Mrs. Wilmot was convinced of one thing.         ''There's a strong possibility,'' she said, ''that if the boat had washed up on the Kennedy property, it would be gone already.''         If it all sounded like a movie, that is exactly what the Walt Disney Company thought. For 10 years, it tried to make a film, ''Palm Beached,'' that was supposed to star Melanie Griffith or Bette Midler. It languished in development and died.         Mrs. Wilmot came out strongly against having Ms. Midler portray her. The actress had just appeared in ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills.''         ''Disney wants to be flamboyant, to turn Palm Beach into a Beverly Hills,'' Mrs. Wilmot said. ''And I don't think that's fair.''       
         Erna Furman, an expert on grief in children and a child psychoanalyst who helped develop a teamwork therapy involving teachers, parents and therapists, died on Aug. 9 in Cleveland. She was 76.         The cause was lung cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, where she worked for about 50 years.         The Perkins Center used psychoanalytic ideas to help children deal with emotional problems and incorporated the idea of team treatment, which helped parents understand children's actions.         Mrs. Furman wrote, edited and contributed to books based on research at the center.         The book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement,'' which she worked on with the psychoanalyst Dr. Anna Freud in the 1970's, challenged the idea that children who lose a parent do not need the same attention that adults do. She showed that even toddlers can be helped to mourn a parent. The work won the American Medical Writers Association Book Award in 1975.         Mrs. Furman's book ''Toddlers and Their Mothers'' describes her findings from a 1980's research project on the importance of the mother-child relationship, particularly in the second and third years of life.         Mrs. Furman was born Erna Mary Poppe in Vienna on June 14, 1926. In 1938, her family fled to Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. Four years later, however, she was sent to the Terezin concentration camp, near Prague.         While there, she kept a journal and drew portraits of other captives, many of them children whom she befriended and helped care for. Some of her drawings were later exhibited, to critical acclaim, in museums, including ones in Tokyo and Los Angeles.         Mrs. Furman, who was educated at the Academy of Commerce in Prague, came to the United States in the late 1940's. She received many honors for her contributions to child psychoanalysis and was made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1999.         Dr. Robert Furman, her husband of 48 years and her colleague, died Sept. 21 at 78. He was known for helping develop the Hannah Perkins Center and the Cleveland Center for Research in Child Development. He was the first director of the Hannah Perkins Center.         ''In many ways, it was the couple together, Dr. and Mrs. Furman, who made the Hannah Perkins Center what it is today,'' said Barbara Streeter, the center's therapy director.         The Furmans are survived by two daughters, Lydia Furman Peter of Cleveland and Tanya Furman Larson of State College, Pa.; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  October 9, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Sept. 30 about Erna Furman, a child psychoanalyst and an expert on grief, gave a misspelled name in some references to the center where she practiced. It is the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, not Hannah. Because of an editing error, Mrs. Furman's maiden name was misspelled. It was Popper, not Poppe. The article misstated the timing of Mrs. Furman's immigration to the United States. It occurred in the 1950's, not the 40's.         The obituary also misstated the role of the psychoanalyst Anna Freud in Mrs. Furman's book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement.'' Dr. Freud wrote an introduction; she did not contribute to the text.       
         Pearlee Toliver, a northeastern Louisiana radio announcer known as the ''jewel of the dial,'' who attracted a cult following because of the idiosyncratic way in which she wrote and read advertisements, died Sept. 9 at her home in Monroe, La.         No one seemed to know how old she was, but she was presumed to be in her 70's. The cause was a heart attack, said Mike Luster, a Louisiana folklorist who helped her with her radio show.         For nearly 30 years on various stations in Monroe, Ms. Toliver presided over a show that mostly consisted of her reading advertisements back to back for businesses like Bubba's Fish Market, Amco Bail Bonds and Mother Helen, a spiritual adviser.         Because of her quirky sing-song banter -- that of a churchgoing, community-minded woman infused with the spirit of an auctioneer with a speech impediment -- she attracted a fan base that extended far beyond her broadcast radius. Cassette copies of her show found their way to musicians like Loretta Lynn, Marcia Ball and Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.         Ben Sandmel, a Louisiana writer and drummer, named his record label Hot Biscuits for a recurring phrase from one of Ms. Toliver's best-remembered advertisements, in which she says of the restaurant Riverside Coney Island, ''Hot biscuits, hot biscuits, all over that place.''         Ms. Toliver was born in Drew, Miss., where her parents were sharecroppers. As a teenager, she dreamed of being on the radio. In 1945 she served in the Woman's Army Corps for three years. Afterward, she managed the gospel group the Jordan Singers, which recorded for Checkers (part of the legendary Chicago blues label Chess). Acting on the advice of a minister, the group started a radio program on KLIC-AM in Monroe.         When the group broke up, Ms. Toliver asked the station manager if she could continue the show. Besides enjoying the work, she needed the income because her husband had been killed in a hunting accident.         The station manager allowed her to keep the show so long as she could find enough sponsors to make it worth his while. So Ms. Toliver visited businesses, collecting money for advertisements and inspecting the wares, so that she could write an informed commercial. For the next three decades, she said, she prayed to God for her sponsors and then made the rounds collecting advertisements and money. Some sponsors, like the Twin City Record Shop, owned by a former member of the Jordan Singers, remained with Ms. Toliver from her first shows to the last ones.         Her program was carried by several Monroe stations, but even though it expanded to two hours, there was not enough time for all the potential sponsors. The price of an advertisement was never more than $15.         For additional income, she worked at a university and helped raise the children of a large local family.         Last year, Ms. Toliver appeared in the Robert Mugge documentary ''Rhythm 'n Bayous.'' She recorded her last show -- on station KZRZ-AM -- on Sept. 5. She is survived by four children, Shirley Sapp and Mattie McGee, both of Monroe; Willie Lee Toliver of Ahoskie, N.C.; and Tony Toliver of Columbus, Ga.         A typical homespun advertisement, this one for a bail bondsman, went like this: ''Friend, was you up all night long getting in trouble? Did you happen to rob the grocery store? Did you kill somebody last night? Diddy Bop said no bond gets too large or too small for him to handle. Why not call Diddy Bop and sit down and tell him your trouble.'' Most advertisements ended with the rushed, elided catchphrase, ''Why not check it out and lock it in?''         After a while, admirers stopped trying to figure out how she developed her style. When asked, she responded that she was divinely inspired by ''the spirit.''       
         Lolita Torres, a leading actress and singer from Argentina who became an international symbol of that nation's golden age of moviemaking in the 1950's, died on Saturday in Buenos Aires. She was 72.         The cause was a lung infection related to a chronic rheumatoid condition, the Spanish news agency EFE reported.         Born Beatriz Mariana Torres in 1930 in Avellana, a city near the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, she began her career at age 11 singing folk songs from Spain at the popular Avenida Theater in Buenos Aires.         A granddaughter of immigrants to Argentina from the Spanish regions of Navarre and Galicia, Ms. Torres easily mastered singing with an accent from Spain. That ability caught the attention of Manolo Paredes, a prominent Spanish actor, and Ramón Zarzoso, the flamenco maestro, both of whom helped her early in her show business career.         She began acting in 1944 with a small role in ''The Dance of Fortune,'' a movie directed by Luis Bayón Herrera about the marital ambitions of the nouveau riche. By the early 1950's, she had gained renown, particularly for her roles in musical comedies, several of them conceived by the screenwriter Abel Santa Cruz.         In these roles Ms. Torres, who rarely allowed herself to be kissed onscreen, conveyed a traditional yet independent image that was new to moviemaking in Argentina and elsewhere.         ''Smooth, sweet, and at the same time energetic, aspiring to emancipation,'' was how the newspaper La Nación described her appeal to young female viewers.         Ms. Torres was popular outside Argentina, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union, where she was lauded during the 1950's as a symbol of enterprising youth. ''The Age of Love,'' about the frustrated loves of a famous singer and a millionaire, directed by Julio Saraceni in 1954, was perhaps her biggest movie hit abroad.         Ms. Torres acted in 17 films before retiring as an actress in 1972. After recording hits like ''Gitano Jesus,'' or ''Gypsy Jesus,'' she continued her singing career, touring several other nations in Latin America, Spain and the former Soviet Union.         Her first husband, Santiago Rodolfo Burastero, died in 1959 after a car accident near Mar del Plata, Argentina.         Her second husband, Julio Caccia, suffered a heart attack at her burial ceremony Sunday at the Argentine Actors' Association mausoleum in Buenos Aires and was admitted to the hospital, news reports said. She is also survived by five children, Santiago, Angélica, Marcelo, Mariana and Diego, an internationally known pop star.       
         Quita Brodhead, a painter of colorful figurative and abstract paintings for more than 80 years, died on Sept. 4 in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 101 and lived in Wayne, Pa.         She had a vibrant style that continued to evolve through her life. Her early work was mostly nudes and still lifes, influenced by Cézanne and Matisse. But starting in the 1950's her work became more abstract but kept her signature bright colors.         Ms. Brodhead was born Marie Waggaman Berl on March 5, 1901, and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her first New York show was in 1938. Her father used to call her Mariequita -- Little Marie -- hence her nickname.         Her work is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Delaware Art Museum, the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, N.Y., and other museums. Her last show, at a college, closed on Aug. 30.         She is survived by three children, Edith Good of Charlottesville, Va.; Truxtun Brodhead of Niantic, Conn.; and Charles Brodhead of Alexandria, Va.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Her marriage to Truxtun Read Brodhead ended in divorce.         Grace Glueck wrote in The New York Times of Ms. Brodhead's centenary exhibition: ''The gifts of long life and the talent to live it rewardingly do not go to many. Ms. Brodhead is quite simply a phenomenon.''       
         Elizabeth Coblentz, an Amish homemaker who wrote a syndicated cooking column by hand beneath a kerosene lantern, a kitchen chronicle that touched on everything from the merits of Belgian horses to coping with grief, died on Tuesday in Blue Springs, Mo. She was 66.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Kevin Williams, her editor at Oasis Newsfeatures, which distributed her column to 105 newspapers, with more than two million readers.         A member of the strict Old Order Amish, who avoid most modern conveniences, she lived on a farm near Geneva, Ind., without running water, electricity, plumbing or a telephone. She traveled primarily by horse-drawn buggy, sewed her family's clothes and canned fruits and vegetables. She answered questions many readers had never thought to ask, including how to cook a meal for 76 children.         She mailed in her weekly columns, but Mr. Williams sometimes did not have time to mail his editing questions, so he would wire daisies with a card enclosed. One asked: ''How much sugar in that cream pie recipe?'' Mr. Williams had prepaid Express Mail envelopes at her home in which she could reply.         Mrs. Coblentz's columns seemed to be ripped from the pages of a 19th-century church bulletin, with their descriptions of quilting bees, children's funerals, sleigh rides and walking barefoot in warm spring soil. She told of baking 70 pies and 14 plates of ''nothings,'' a traditional Amish pastry, for her daughter's wedding.         In one column -- she called them letters -- she described a day that began at 4 a.m. with cooking breakfast of fried potatoes, eggs and bacon. The 11 a.m. entry: ''Went in to get dinner, as I've got menfolk working hard, hauling loads and loads of manure with the manure spreader that is driven by a team of horses.''         Her religious faith was a constant theme. But food, of the most comfortable kind, was her main topic, from Aunt Hilty's cinnamon rolls to putting up pumpkin pickles to churning a double batch of hot pepper butter. Among her recipes were those for sauerkraut bread, watermelon preserves and dandelion jelly.         The overall effect of her columns was an insight into the way of life and fundamental values of the Amish.         ''You would not notice much difference in our life now from when I was a girl or my mother was a girl,'' Mrs. Coblentz said in an Associated Press interview in 2000.         Elizabeth Coblentz was born in Berne, Ind., on July 18, 1936. She had six sisters and one brother and grew up on a farm. She left school after ninth grade, in accordance with Amish custom. She worked in a sugar factory, cleaned houses and married young. Starting in 1952, she wrote community news for a nationally distributed Amish newspaper.         Mr. Williams discovered her in 1991, after having done a research paper on the Amish as a college freshman. After having the idea of an Amish cooking column, he ran into Mrs. Coblentz by chance.         The first newspaper to take the column was The Quincy Herald-Whig of Quincy, Ill. It now appears in papers from Newton, N.J., to Indianapolis to Tacoma. But Mrs. Coblentz's picture does not appear with it. Following Amish tradition rooted in biblical passages that decry ''graven images,'' she refused to be photographed, appear on television or allow her voice to be taped.         But she had nothing against personal appearances and was on a publicity tour to promote her new book when she died. The book, ''The Amish Cook: Recipes and Recollections From an Old Order Amish Family,'' is to be published in November by Ten Speed Press of Berkeley, Calif. Her earlier work, ''The Best of the Amish Cook,'' a collection of her newspaper columns, was published by Oasis in two volumes.         On her tour, she traveled with Mr. Williams by car, as the Amish faith permits people to use technology as long as it does not intrude on their lives, he said. Owning an auto was out of the question for Mrs. Coblentz, Mr. Williams said, because it would have brought the whole world within her reach. Riding with someone is a compromise most Amish are willing to make, he said.         Her husband, Benjamin, a carpenter, died in 2000, throwing her into a depression that Mr. Williams said he believes led to her death. More than 3,000 readers sent cards and 5,000 sent e-mail messages to the syndicate that distributed her column.         She is survived by her daughters, Leah Shetler, Verena and Susan Coblentz, Elizabeth Wengerd, Lovina Eicher and Emma Schwartz, all of Geneva; her sons, Amos of Berne and Albert of Geneva; her sisters, Leah Girod of Berne, Lovina Swartzentruber of LaGrange, Ind., Emma Schwartz of Berne and Salome Hilty and Barbara Schwartz, both of Geneva; her brother, Chris A. Graber of Bryant, Ind.; and 35 grandchildren.         Many of her readers seemed to feel close to her. In a letter before Mrs. Coblentz's death, Betty Watters of Independence, Mo., wrote, ''Your letters remind me of my mother -- her chickens, gardens, canning, cleaning, working every day in fields by Dad's side and clean-smelling laundry whipping and snapping in the fresh air and sunshine.''

         Capt. Kathleen McGrath, the first woman to command a United States Navy warship, died on Thursday at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. She was 50 and lived in McLean, Va.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Peggy McGrath.         Captain McGrath became commander of the frigate Jarrett, a 453-foot warship, with a 262-member crew, in the spring of 2000.         She took the helm six years after Congress lifted rules that prohibited women from serving on combat aircraft and warships.         Captain McGrath guided the ship to the northern reaches of the Persian Gulf, where the crew hunted boats suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of United Nations sanctions.         A 1975 graduate of California State University at Sacramento, she worked for the United States Forestry Service until 1980, when she decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join the Air Force.         But the recruiter was out to lunch, and she was won over by a Navy recruiter who promised her overseas travel.         Captain McGrath had deployments in the Western Pacific, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas.         In 1990, she participated in the operation intended to protect Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait.         She also commanded the rescue and salvage ship Recovery in 1993 and 1994.         ''Kathy was an accomplished surface warrior and leader,'' said Rear Adm. Harry Ulrich, director of surface warfare.         After her tour as commander of the Jarrett, Captain McGrath served at the Joint Advanced Warfighting Unit in Alexandria, Va.         During her career, Captain McGrath was honored with many medals, including the Legion of Merit and four Meritorious Service Medals.         In addition to her sister Peggy, she is survived by two other sisters; two brothers; her husband, Lt. Cmdr. Gregory Brandon, who is retired; their children, Nicholas and Clare; and her parents, James and Martha McGrath of Sequim, Wash.       
         Tatyana M. Velikanova, a Soviet human rights activist who was a leading editor of the most important samizdat journal of human rights abuses and spent nearly nine years in prison camp and exile, died of cancer on Sept. 19. She was 70 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Velikanova, a mathematician by profession, became a dissident in 1968, when she went to Red Square with her husband, Konstantin Babitsky, who was one of only seven people to demonstrate openly against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring reforms.         Mr. Babitsky was arrested and banished for several years to the far north of Russia. The next year, Ms. Velikanova helped found the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the U.S.S.R., and became the backbone of the Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat news bulletin, after the arrest of its founder, Natalya Gorbanevskaya. The chronicle was the main uncensored source of information about the dissident movement around the Soviet Union during the rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev.         At a time when photocopying machines were rare and kept literally under lock and key in Soviet offices, the compilers of the chronicle gathered information and then produced multiple copies by typing through layers of carbon paper.         The chronicle was written in a dry, telegraphic style, and defended all repressed groups, from Pentecostal believers to Jewish refuseniks, Russian Orthodox priests, Georgian nationalists, deported Crimean Tatars, and intellectuals and religious believers in the Baltic republics.         Ms. Velikanova herself was an observant Orthodox Christian.         She was arrested in 1979 on charges of ''anti-Soviet propaganda,'' and a report in the Chronicle around that time detailed official questioning of her sister about her ties to the West, as well as the interrogator's relaying his prisoner's request for a Bible and photographs of her grandchildren.         Ms. Velikanova received a nine-year sentence, serving four years in prison camp and then being exiled to a desolate part of Kazakhstan.         In a statement written during his own banishment from Moscow to the city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Andrei D. Sakharov lauded Ms. Velikanova for her dedication to the cause of the oppressed, regardless of whether she agreed with their views. ''Her only consideration was whether someone had suffered injustice,'' he wrote.         During the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Ms. Velikanova was allowed to return to Moscow before her nine-year term was fully served. In her final years, she lived out of the public eye, teaching math and Russian language and literature at a Moscow school until just months before her death.         She is survived by three children, Natalie Babitsky of France, Fyodor Babitsky of Moscow and Yulia Keidan of Italy; 13 grandchildren; two brothers, Andrew Velihan of Northport, N.Y., and Kirill Velikanov of Moscow; and two sisters, Yekaterina Velikanova of Moscow and Mary Velihan Grigorenko of New York City.       
         Catherine Connelly, who as an 11-year-old in 1904 escaped the inferno that burned the General Slocum, an excursion boat in the East River, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Wilton, Conn. She was 109 and was one of the last two survivors of the disaster, according to a commemorative group.         Maureen Enright, Mrs. Connelly's granddaughter, reported the death. Kenneth Leib, president of the General Slocum Memorial Association, said that only one General Slocum survivor remains alive: Adella Wotherspoon, 98, a retired teacher in Watchung, N.J.         ''I'm sorry, of course,'' Mrs. Wotherspoon said in a phone interview. ''She had a very long life. She was a very interesting person.''         Mrs. Connelly treasured her family more than anything, and she is survived by her two daughters Jeanne Meehan of Goshen, N.Y., and Elizabeth Reilly of Greenwich, Conn.; 27 grandchildren; 30 great-grandchildren; and 7 great-great-grandchildren.         She had all but one of her 11 babies at home, and made her own diapers. Mother's Days meant wall-to-wall flowers in the Manhattan apartment where she lived alone until she was 102. Her pleasures included cooking rich food, and her secret for longevity was a banana a day.         But every year in the weeks leading up to June 15, the anniversary of the disaster -- New York City's most lethal fire until Sept. 11, 2001 -- she would become sad. She remembered the boy shouting ''fire'' over a brass band, mothers and children with clothing on fire leaping into the swirling whirlpools of Hell Gate in the East River, dresses shredded in machinery. When it was all over, 1,021 of the 1,331 passengers on the Sunday School cruise on a sunny day were dead.         ''Sometimes he's very cruel, the man upstairs,'' Mrs. Connelly said in an interview with The New York Times in 1989.         Catherine Uhlmyer was born in Manhattan on April 4, 1893. Her father died before she was a year old, and her mother married John Gallagher. His last name became hers.         She grew up in what was known as Little Germany, an enclave between Houston and 14th Streets on the East Side. Pickles were a penny each, and stacks of rye bread with apple butter were the delicacy of the day. St. Mark's Lutheran Church on East Sixth Street was the place of worship for much of the community.         The church chartered the General Slocum, a wooden sidewheel steamboat, for the outing. A grocer who belonged to the church gave the Gallaghers, who were Roman Catholics, three tickets. But they needed one more. Mr. Gallagher had to work.         ''I went over to the store crying and they gave me a ticket,'' Mrs. Connelly said. ''I was never on a boat before.''         Nor did she ever set foot on one again.         The passengers boarded at 9:40 a.m. for the trip to Long Island for a picnic. After catching fire at Hell Gate, the General Slocum put ashore on North Brother Island at 10:40 and burned. Catherine Gallagher was rescued by a tugboat.         An investigation revealed that life jackets and fire hoses had fallen apart with age; lifeboats were wired in place; and the crew had never conducted a fire drill. Only the ship's captain went to prison.         In the days after the disaster, Little Germany's doorways were draped in black, and on June 18, 1904, the neighborhood saw 156 funerals. More than 600 households lost loved ones. Mrs. Connelly lost her mother, brother and sister. Mrs. Wotherspoon lost two sisters, two cousins and two aunts.         Catherine Gallagher first lived with her grandparents, then with an aunt and uncle. She dropped out of school at 13, and at 20 she married Thomas Connelly, a truck driver.         In Mrs. Connelly's later years, she was interviewed for many articles and television documentaries on the General Slocum, but she never lost her perspective.         ''You know,'' she said in the interview with The Times, ''you don't fully grasp the meaning of everything.''       
         Eileen Simpson, a writer who probed the depths of her difficult early life and, in a well-known memoir, the tumultuous years with her husband John Berryman and their circle of poet friends, died on Monday at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         ''All poets' wives have rotten lives,'' Delmore Schwartz once said. Judging from ''Poets in Their Youth'' (Random House), Ms. Simpson's 1982 memoir, he was right.         Besides Berryman, Ms. Simpson also offered revelatory glimpses of Randall Jarrell, Delmore Schwartz and Robert Lowell among others, all of them writers who were born in the shadow of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and who came of age in an American society that had little use for poetry. As portrayed by Ms. Simpson, the wives were often cast as mothers, nursemaids and muses to their self-absorbed, irresponsible and often abusive husbands. Ms. Simpson and Berryman stayed together for 11 years until, worn out by his infidelities, she left him; they later divorced, in 1956. He committed suicide in 1972.         Ms. Simpson's identity, however, grew far beyond that of a poet's wife. She obtained a master's degree in psychology at New York University, became a psychotherapist and, eventually, a writer.         In ''Orphans: Real and Imaginary'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), Ms. Simpson wrote of loss and dislocation. She was born Eileen Patricia Mulligan in New York City. Her mother died when she was 11 months old. By the time she was 2, her father, unable to care for her, sent Eileen and her younger sister, Marie, to live in a convent in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He died four years later. Relatives, fearing the girls might contract tuberculosis, later moved them to a ''preventatorium,'' in New Jersey, where children were boarded to improve their health.         In school, Ms. Simpson struggled with dyslexia that went undiagnosed. She pretended to be able to read and write, surviving by guessing words and inventing connections between them and sometimes just remaining mute, as she wrote in ''Reversals: A Personal Account of Victory Over Dyslexia,'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1979).         Ms. Simpson met Berryman at a New Year's Day party in 1941 after she graduated from Hunter College. In ''Poets in Their Youth,'' she wrote that he had ''an irresistible grin'' and kissed her under the mistletoe. Berryman was a somewhat formal figure in his three-piece suits and gold watch chain, and he was intensely ambitious. They married in 1942.         It was Berryman, she recalled in ''Reversals,'' who actually discovered that she was dyslexic, after she had written him a note: ''Deare/ Time for olny a hurried note . . . Swimming every day despite gary skies. Tomorrow we calabrent M's birthday.''         Still, madness and despondency were the principal motifs of her life with him. Eventually she grew weary of what she called ''the sight of poets disporting themselves,'' and left him. Most of the poets she wrote about ended their lives in despair. Jarrell was probably a suicide, Schwartz died a virtual derelict, Lowell suffered from depression and alcoholism.         ''As Keats imagined himself sitting beside Shakespeare in a tavern in the next world,'' she wrote in her memoir, ''so they saw themselves separated from the rest of us, 'institutionalized,' surrounded by poets.''         In 1960 she married Robert Simpson, a banker and teacher, and accompanied him to Paris. Unable to practice psychotherapy overseas, she began writing her first book, ''The Maze,'' an autobiographical novel about her marriage to Berryman (Simon & Schuster, 1975). ''Her sense of bewilderment and anguish is beautifully communicated,'' Joyce Carol Oates wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''and it is impossible to read 'The Maze' without being deeply and permanently moved.''         After Mr. Simpson's death, she married Francis X. Baine in 1989. He died in the late 1990's. Her last book, in 1994, was ''Late Love: A Celebration of Marriage After 50,'' (Peter Davison/Houghton Mifflin).         Ms. Simpson is survived by her sister, Marie Hall.       
         Elizabeth Longford, the best-selling biographer and political activist who was the widow of the social reformer Lord Longford and the matriarch of a family that bred other well-known writers, died on Wednesday at her home in Sussex. She was 96.         From her school years through the nearly seven decades of her marriage to Lord Longford, she was famous for her intelligence, beauty, vitality and vivacity.         She was already an academic and social success at Oxford University when John Betjeman, one of the many literary figures she befriended, called her ''the aesthetes' moll.'' Quintin Hogg, who later as Lord Hailsham became a Conservative lord chancellor, said, ''There was not an undergraduate who would not consider it a privilege to hold an umbrella over her.''         Among her seven surviving children are the writers Antonia Fraser, Rachel Billington and Thomas Pakenham and the poet Judith Kazantzis. A daughter, Catherine, a magazine writer, died in a car crash at age 23 in 1969, and a prominent prize for women in journalism is named for her.         Lady Longford confessed to having ''an addiction to motherhood'' and continued to have children even after her Labor Party handlers said it was getting in the way of her parliamentary career. She ran for office unsuccessfully twice and had to bow out of a third contest, in which she was the favorite, because of pressure over her intent to have more children.         She was born Elizabeth Harman and was to be known as Elizabeth Pakenham for the first three decades of her marriage to Frank Pakenham; they became Lord and Lady Longford in 1961. She was the daughter of two Harley Street physicians and had a privileged upbringing.         Her biographies are known for their strong narrative lines and their wealth of research and detail, drawn from personal visits to historic sites. Her obituary in The Guardian of London said that she advised her children and grandchildren that ''not to study history would be like living in a house with no windows.''         The Longford marriage was one of the most celebrated in Britain. As partners, they deeply influenced each other.         She steered him away from his early Conservative Party enthusiasm to her socialist convictions. He persuaded her to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1946, a step he took in 1940.         Lord Longford, who died at 95 in August 2001, was a Labor peer famous for championing social outcasts and unpopular causes. When he was lampooned in later life as everything from an endearing eccentric to a bumbling loon, she was his passionate defender.         He was as unkempt as she was well turned out, and their contrasting appearances illustrated the nature of their partnership. Lord Longford always credited his wife with providing him with the self-control and common sense that he lacked.         Auberon Waugh, a godson, once said, ''I think he sees himself a little bit as a knight errant going out to do things which will please her.''         Lord Longford said at one of the couple's many anniversary parties: ''I think it would be very difficult to become bored with Elizabeth. No one else has ever been.''         Her writing career began after her third campaign for Parliament in 1950 and running after having had her eighth child. She began writing articles on family life and parenting for Lord Beaverbrook's Express newspapers. A collection of them, ''Points for Parents,'' was published by George Weidenfeld in 1956, and from there she moved on to larger subjects.         She received good reviews for her history ''Jameson's Raid'' in 1960 and then achieved widespread success with the biography ''Victoria R. I.'' in 1964; a two-volume life of the Duke of Wellington, ''The Years of the Sword,'' in 1969; and ''Pillar of State'' in 1972.         By the 1980's Lady Longford, who had begun public life as an ardent socialist, had become close to the royal family, and her next major biography was ''Elizabeth R,'' in 1983. She wrote about royals and political figures into her 90's, publishing her last book, a brief history called ''Queen Victoria,'' in 1999.         Sarah Bradford, a biographer of George VI, wrote in The Independent of London that Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother had said she felt that women could be divided into two groups, either beautiful and stupid or clever and plain, ''except Elizabeth Longford, of course.''       
         Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, president of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and a director of the Hearst Corporation, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said Paul Luthringer, a spokesman for the Hearst Corporation.         A granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, Mrs. Boudjakdji (pronounced Bood-JACK-gee) was named president of the foundation, an independent private philanthropy, in January, 2001. She also established her own charitable foundation, the Boudjakdji Foundation, which focused on education and the arts.         Mrs. Boudjakdji had served on the Hearst Corporation's board since 1986.         Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, the daughter of David Whitmire Hearst and Hope Chandler Hearst, was born on March 24, 1939, in Los Angeles and graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1961.         She is survived by her husband, Raouf Boudjakdji; four children; three grandchildren; her mother; and a brother.         Correction:  October 29, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, president of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, misstated the date of her death. It was Oct. 16, not Oct. 23.       
         Carole Kismaric, an innovative editor and book packager who helped start the Time-Life Photography Series and for 10 years was editorial director of the Aperture Foundation, a nonprofit publisher of fine-art photography books, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 60.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her sister, Susan Kismaric, said.         While at Aperture, from 1976 to 1985, Ms. Kismaric was a force in changing the face of photography book publishing. At the start of her tenure, books of fine-art photography -- including Aperture's -- generally reproduced one picture per page, without caption or text and surrounded by a frame of white space, as if it were a framed print.         Working with the Aperture designer Wendy Byrne and others, she helped usher in a more flexible, magazine-influenced design approach, in which pictures might be reproduced across two pages and combined with text.         But her purpose was more than a matter of presentation: she sought to demonstrate how books of artistically bold pictures could also yield social and political meanings beyond the purview of art and thus appeal to broad audiences.         To further demonstrate how thoroughly photographs are ingrained in contemporary culture, in 1991 she joined with Marvin Heiferman, an independent curator and writer, to create Lookout, a partnership that developed and produced exhibitions and publications.         Among the exhibitions Lookout produced were ''Talking Pictures,'' a 1994 traveling exhibition that allowed museum visitors to listen to prerecorded commentaries about how the pictures had influenced the speakers' lives, and ''Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic Revolution,'' a 2000 exhibition at Exit Art in New York that focused on artists' responses to the promise and perils of genetic research. Together with ''Fame After Photography,'' commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, and ''To the Rescue: Artists in an Archive,'' a project based on the archive of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, these exhibitions were noted for their conceptual ingenuity and popular appeal.         Among the books produced by Ms. Kismaric and Mr. Heiferman under the Lookout name were ''Frida Kahlo: The Camera Seduced'' (Chronicle Books, 1992); ''Fay's Fairy Tales: Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood,'' by William Wegman (Hyperion, 1993); and ''Love is Blind'' (PowerHouse, 1997). In addition, as publications director of the P.S. 1 Museum since 1985, Ms. Kismaric developed books on the artists John Coplans, David Hammons and Jack Smith.         Carole Kismaric was born on April 28, 1942, in Orange, N.J. As a student at Penn State University she majored in psychology, but after graduation in 1964 she pursued a career as a newspaper reporter. Time-Life Books hired her as a picture researcher in 1970. As an associate editor, she helped develop the Time-Life Photography Series and edited five of its titles.         In 1974 Ms. Kismaric collaborated with John Szarkowski, then director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, on the exhibition ''From the Picture Press.'' The show consisted entirely of pictures pictures made for publication in newspapers and magazines.         When she joined Aperture in 1976, it was still associated with the aesthetic of its founding editor, the photographer Minor White. Working with Michael Hoffman, Aperture's publisher, she developed and edited more than 50 titles, including ''Diane Arbus: Magazine Work,'' ''The Eloquent Light'' by Ansel Adams, ''Telex Iran'' by Gilles Peress, and ''Social Graces'' by Larry Fink.         She also edited the quarterly magazine called Aperture, introducing to its pages a wide range of contemporary photographs far removed from the journal's traditional artistic roots.         After leaving Aperture in 1986, Ms. Kismaric struck out on her own and produced an exhibition and book, ''Forced Out: The Agony of the Refugee in Our Time'' (1989), under the auspices of the J. M. Kaplan Fund and Human Rights Watch. In 1990 she began teaching in the graduate photography program of the School of Visual Arts.         Ms. Kismaric was married to Charles Mikolaycak, a children' book illustrator. Mr. Mikolaycak died in 1993. She is survived by her sister, Susan.       
         Antonia Stone, a prep-school mathematics teacher who left the classroom after 20 years of teaching and devoted herself to instructing the poor and the imprisoned about the importance of personal computers, died on Thursday at her home in Watertown, Mass. She was 72.         Ms. Stone was an early critic of the so-called technology gap between the rich and the poor and set out to narrow it by providing computers to people who otherwise might not have access to them.         She began by establishing a program with the Fortune Society, a group that advocates for inmates, to teach former prisoners how to use computers and to bring computer-education courses into New York prisons.         In 1983, she created Playing to Win Inc., a computer center in the basement of a public housing project in East Harlem. At the center, local children were encouraged, in a casual setting, to use reading, math and geography programs on the computer. Ms. Stone attracted her first participants by canvassing the local playgrounds and talking to children about the crucial role that computers played -- and would continue to play -- in society.         Playing to Win, renamed the Community Technology Centers' Network, caught on and eventually opened affiliates across the country and in Europe, Central America and Japan. With more than 1,000 community-based technology centers worldwide, the group tries to create ''a society in which all people are equitably empowered by technology skills and usage,'' according to its Web site, ctcnet.org.         Ms. Stone was raised in New Canaan, Conn., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1952. She taught math in several private schools in New York City during the 1970's and eventually became the chairwoman of the math departments at the Town School and the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School.         She received many honors, including the lifetime achievement award from the Harvard chapter of Women in Technology and an honorary degree from De Paul University's College of Computer Science.         She is survived by her partner, Tim Barclay; her sons, Christopher Stone of Brooklyn, and Nicholas Stone of Falls Church, Va.; and her daughter, Rebecca Stone of Brookline, Mass.       
         Harriet Doerr, who at 73 published her first novel, unveiling an exquisite gift to marshal clear, sparse prose to evoke, in her phrase, memories ''like a gentle knife stuck into your heart,'' died on Sunday at her home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 92.         She had been in declining health since she suffered a broken hip in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha Doerr Toppin. In recent years, glaucoma and frailty kept her from writing, even at her methodical pace of a sentence or so an hour.         Ms. Doerr's gleaming literary reputation rested on three slender books, perhaps 600 pages in all.         Her first book, ''Stones for Ibarra'' (Viking, 1984), which won the American Book Award for first fiction, was called ''a perfect book'' by the writer Alice Adams, and her next novel and a book of short stories elicited similar praise.         Her style roamed the geography of Mexico, memory and mood in a manner that the critic Anatole Broyard in The New York Times said carried ''echoes of Gabriel García Márquez, Katherine Anne Porter and even Graham Greene.'' Her gift for phrasing was suggested by her description of the Mexican village as ''no more than a shard chipped from the rock face of eternity.'' Elsewhere she called it ''a town of a hundred burros.''         Her critics generally agreed that she improved with age, and emphasized that her works would have been remarkable for a writer of any age.         In reviewing her second novel, ''Consider This, Señora'' (Harcourt, 1993), published in 1993, when she was 83, the critic Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, ''Everything is richer, as when an actress takes a role you saw her play a decade ago, and lets you read that decade in her face, her voice and her body.''         Harriet Green Huntington was born in Pasadena on April 8, 1910, the third of six children and two step-children. Her grandfather was Henry Edwards Huntington, and she played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. She grew up with nannies and servants, as well as more intangible blessings: her family loved reading and lively discussions, her daughter said.         Ms. Doerr was asked to read several of her poems at high school graduation, but would not allow the school to reproduce them because she thought they were awful. When she was 16, she met Albert Doerr, an engineering student at Stanford University who took her to a prize fight on their first date. She was horrified, not least because of the droplets of blood that had spattered on her dress.         She went east to Smith College in 1927 with her train compartment filled with roses from Mr. Doerr. She did not like the cold of Massachusetts and felt homesick and ''half in love.'' By the summer of 1928, she left Smith and transferred to Stanford. where Mr. Doerr was finishing his degree. They married in 1930, and she left college.         They had two children; the first, a son, Michael, died of cancer in 1995. Ms. Toppin, the second child and Ms. Doerr's only survivor, lives in Oakland.         In World War II, while her husband served in the Navy, she and he signed petitions protesting the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps.         The family went to Mexico in the late 1950's. There Mr. Doerr oversaw the revival of his family's mining business. Much of the emotional quality of that experience is contained in Ms. Doerr's first novel, including the male protagonist's struggle with leukemia. Mr. Doerr died of leukemia in 1972.         Her son teased Ms. Doerr into returning to college in 1975. She first took some classes at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., and then enrolled full time at Stanford, majoring in history. She was accepted into the university's prestigious creative-writing program. Other students resented her presence, until she read her first piece aloud.         Ms. Doerr won the $2,500 Transatlantic Review-Henfield Foundation Award in 1982, based on three stories she had published in small literary magazines. Senior editors at Viking Penguin suggested her stories could be combined into a novel. She and a professor shuffled them on her living room floor until a larger narrative fell into place.         Her next novel, ''Consider This, Señora,'' was also set in Mexico and was seen by some critics as imitative. But Laura Cumming, writing in The Guardian of London, said it was ''full of enchanted fables.''         ''The Tiger in the Grass'' (Viking, 1995) was a collection of essays, many about Mexico. But words of searing pain reflected a more immediate concern: her son was then dying of cancer, and Ms. Doerr used italicized passages to tell his story. In one, she remembered that his first word was ''car'' and that the doctor had just forbidden him to drive.         ''Now his car is parked outside his house and is visible from several windows,'' she wrote. ''I have forgotten the details of Chinese water torture we used to hear of, but it must be something like this.''         Ms. Doerr believed in no religion, but often took solace in each person's ability to create memories that live on. In ''Consider This, Señora,'' the character Ursula Bowles, a widow who enters the story at age 79 and exits at 83, witnesses life's evanescence.         ''She could see that an individual life is, in the end, nothing more than a stirring of air, a shifting of light,'' Ms. Doerr wrote. ''No one of us, finally, can be more than that. Even Einstein. Even Brahms.         ''Then the widow slept.''       
         Leah Harrison, an expert on child abuse, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 55 and lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, said her husband, Fred Harrison.         In 1988, Mrs. Harrison was a founder of of the child-protection program that in 1997 became the J.E. and Z.B. Butler Child Protection Center of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. When she died, she was associate director of the center, which has been influential in shaping other anti-child-abuse programs around the United States.         She also headed the UJA-Federation Family Violence Task Force's subcommittee on children and worked with leaders in Jordan, Israel and other countries in setting up pilot programs for guarding children against abuse.         The Leah Harrison Educational Center for Child Protection at Montefiore was named in her honor.         Leah Epstein Harrison was born in Norwalk, Conn., and grew up there. After receiving a bachelor's degree in nursing from Pace University and a master's degree in nursing from Seton Hall University, she joined Montefiore in the late 1960's.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Lillian Epstein of Boca Raton, Fla.; two sons, Eric, of Brewster, N.Y., and Bradley, of Washington; a sister, Roberta Goldstein of Greenbrook, N.J.; and two brothers, Neil Epstein of Trumbull, Conn., and Richard Epstein of Norwalk, Conn.       
         Ellen Straus, a passionate environmentalist and co-owner of the first organic dairy farm west of the Mississippi River, died on Saturday at her home in Marshall, Calif., north of San Francisco. She was 75.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         A pioneer in the purchase of development rights from farmers to save the land from being turned into tract housing and shopping malls, Ms. Straus was a founder of the Marin Agricultural Land Trust in 1980. But she is probably best known outside the Bay Area for the rich, thick milk produced on the family farm, which her son Albert turned into high-quality cheese, yogurt and butter at the Straus Family Creamery.         Ellen Tirza Lotte Prins was born on Feb. 21, 1927, in Amsterdam. Her family fled the country just ahead of the Nazi invasion in 1940. She graduated from Bard College in New York in 1948, but instead of fulfilling her dream of studying medicine, she married William Straus, a German Jewish immigrant 12 years her senior, who had come to study agriculture at the University of California.         It took him only 16 days to persuade her to abandon further studies and move to what was then a small farm on the shores of Tomales Bay in Marin County, Calif. There they brought up four children, Albert, Vivien, Miriam and Michael, who survive her, along with her husband, four grandsons and a sister, Anneke Prins Simons of Jersey City.         Inspired by Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring,'' Ms. Straus turned her attention to the environmental movement when she learned of plans to build hundreds of homes along the Marin County coast as well as a resort at Tomales Bay. She was instrumental in the creation of the Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, preserving 17 ranches. Along with other environmentalists, she persuaded the county supervisors to pass strict zoning laws.         But just to make certain the restrictions could not be changed she helped found the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, or MALT, which now has 47 ranches and dairies covering 32,000 acres. It represents 30 percent of the private farmland in Marin County, and the owners have granted easements saying it must remain agricultural land. Ms. Straus served on its board until 1990 and was its chairwoman from 1999 to 2001.         Today there are 1,000 land trusts throughout the country, and the trust was the model for scores of them.         The Straus family used the money it received for its own conservation easement to convert its farm into an organic operation, a move that saved it from the unprofitable co-op milk market and made it possible for the Strauses to stay in business by selling more profitable products.         Those products, unhomogenized milk with a thick layer of cream on the top, bottled in glass; cream that almost whips itself; and Monterey Jack and white cheddar, are sold throughout California. The farm's Holstein cows also produce all the milk used by the acclaimed Cow Girl Creamery of Point Reyes, for crème fraîche, fromage blanc and Mount Tam triple cream cheese.         Ms. Straus was a hands-on farmer. On the first night of the farm's organic operation, she individually stamped the expiration dates on glass milk bottles as they rolled off the conveyor. Three or four times a year, she led educational tours of the dairy for the agricultural land trust, preparing the lunch for the 50 or so people who attended.         In 1998, the American Farmland Trust in Washington, D.C., presented Ms. Straus with the annual Steward of the Land Award in recognition of her lifelong struggle for family farms. The White House made her a Points of Light winner in 2001 for her lifetime of volunteer work.         When she was honored by the American Farmland Trust, Ms. Straus said World War II had taught her a lifelong lesson about standing for one's beliefs: ''That we, as individuals, are responsible for what is happening in our communities, and that we must become activists.''       
         Joanna Bistany, who became a broadcast news executive when such positions at television networks were almost exclusively occupied by men, died of cancer at her parents' home in Langhorne, Pa., on Sunday, ABC News said yesterday. She was 55 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Bistany spent 17 years at ABC News, most recently as senior vice president from August 1998 until she left in June 2000 to become an independent program developer. Previously, she was vice president at ABC News, and from 1986 to 1998 was chief deputy to Roone Arledge when he was president. Mr. Arledge is now the chairman of ABC News. She joined the network in 1983 as director of news information after serving as President Ronald Reagan's special assistant for communications.         A native of Brooklyn, Ms. Bistany received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Kentucky. Before entering government she taught at the University of Cincinnati and was a staff member of the developmental diagnostic center at the Children's Hospital Medical Center in that city.         She is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Bistany of Langhorne; two brothers, Ed Bistany Jr. of Corham, N.Y., and Larry Bistany of Maple Glen, Pa.; and a sister, Robin Brown of Langhorne, Pa.       
         CAROL ENSEKI, president of the Brooklyn Children's Museum, is an island of tranquillity in the sunny bedlam of a little building that echoes with the din of ecstatic children. She chooses words precisely. She utters them with preternatural calm. Her gentle delivery is so deadpan that it takes a visitor a moment to realize that she has made a sly joke.         She will need every shred of that equanimity and every ounce of that wit to persevere in the coming seasons of uproar in her 103-year-old museum. A $39 million expansion will double the museum's interior space to 102,000 square feet when it is completed in 2006.         The museum, in Crown Heights, will get two new classrooms, a new library, a new exhibition gallery and a cafeteria. The 25-year-old subsurface building will be transformed into a daffodil-yellow two-story showcase, designed by the architect Raphael Viñoly, and featuring two L-shaped wings spreading along Brooklyn and St. Marks Avenues.         Fitted with funky portholes that will glow at night, the museum will have the appearance of a clowny yellow submarine that has rambunctiously surfaced in a neighborhood of brownstones and Victorian houses.         Pretty phat for an institution that the Association of Children's Museums in Washington recognizes as the nation's oldest children's museum.         The existing building was below ground for maximum energy efficiency and to merge it seamlessly with the adjacent Brower Park. But years ago, when crime and vandalism became a problem in Crown Heights, Ms. Enseki's predecessors put up fences. Residents complained that the museum seemed too inward-looking.         Now crime in the neighborhood has dropped significantly, and the museum's relationship with its neighborhood is certainly the opposite of the bunker mentality.         ''The new building will be outward-looking,'' Ms. Enseki said. ''In this community, we are more than just a museum.''         Ms. Enseki's style ''may seem very low-key, but she is passionate about working to get visibility for her museum,'' said Martin Gomez, who came to know her in the seven years he was director of the Brooklyn Public Library. He left the library earlier this year.         Ms. Enseki, 48, attributes her peaceful presence to her Japanese-American heritage. Ms. Enseki's mother, Emi, and her mother's parents were in an internment camp during World War II. Her family lived in New York for a time after their release, which was arranged by Quakers.         ''I have to believe that her calm personality is traceable in part to that,'' said Mr. Gomez, now director of the Friends and Foundation of the San Francisco Public Library.         Ms. Enseki arrived at the museum in 1989 as a developer of exhibits and became its president in 1997. Actually, she is a second-generation exhibit designer: her father, Richard, created industrial exhibits for trade shows, building them in his garage in Glen Rock, N.J., where the family had moved.         ''I think I was destined for the museum field,'' Ms. Enseki said, recalling that her father built ''this eyeball in the garage, for some drug company.''         NOW, Ms. Enseki's family is an unofficial sounding board for her museum's endeavors. Her husband, Bill Fulbrecht, is an artist and kindergarten teacher at Public School 321 in Park Slope. And their son, Daniel, 10, is not shy about critiquing new exhibits.         The museum appeals to children, from toddlers to 15-year-olds. It draws about 250,000 visitors a year, including 30,000 in groups from schools and summer camps.         Mr. Gomez said the museum, which employs 60 people full time, is an anchor of the neighborhood. When community leaders opened it in 1899, the visitors were immigrant children, largely from Eastern Europe. Now 60 percent are African-American or Caribbean-American, and about 25 percent are Jewish.         The museum has raised all but $7 million of the reconstruction cost, which will include $25.2 million from New York City. The money for the expansion is already in the capital budget and, despite the city's financial crisis, ''we are optimistic and confident that construction will move forward,'' Ms. Enseki said.         Many children's museums are in high-traffic tourist areas, but, Ms. Enseki said, ''we are firmly planted in a residential neighborhood, and it has shaped who we are.'' As a member of the board of the American Association of Museums, she has championed the idea that urban museums serve more sophisticated audiences and must be prepared to address questions about issues like AIDS and racial unrest.         After three days of strife in the neighborhood in 1991, the museum ''dealt with the issue directly'' in exhibits, she said.         ''Then, as now, we hope that people will come to the museum so that it can help dispel stereotypes and fears,'' she said. ''You know, a lot of good things happen around here that don't get a lot of notice.''         Ms. Enseki's immediate goal is to keep the museum open during the construction. ''But the real challenge for us is the same it has always been,'' she said. ''To make sure that people know about us.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Aileen Fisher, who was the author of more than 100 books for children, died Dec. 2 at her home in Boulder, Colo. She was 96.         Her works include stories, plays, poetry, biographies, adaptations, picture books and multimedia programs, many of them highly praised for their imaginative qualities. Ms. Fisher was first recognized nationally in 1933, when her book ''The Coffee-Pot Face'' became a selection of the Junior Literary Guild.         Later she received awards from the American Literary Association, the Treasury Department, the National Council of Teachers of English and many others.         In 1958 a reviewer for The New York Times, Anzia Yezierska, said of Ms. Fisher's ''Runny Days, Sunny Days'' (Abelard), a collection of poetry for children 4 to 10, ''She lights the commonplace moment with wonder.'' In 1980 X. J. Kennedy wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Ms. Fisher's ''Out in the Dark and Daylight'' (Harper) demonstrated that she ''is a true poet, no mere light versifier.''         The review also pronounced ''Snowy Benches,'' a four-line poem, ''beautifully concise'':         Do parks get lonely         in winter, perhaps,         when benches have only         snow on their laps?         Aileen Lucia Fisher was born on Sept. 9, 1906, in Iron River, a small mining town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.         She attended the University of Chicago and graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1927.         Ms. Fisher is survived by two sisters, Lucia F. Baker of Boulder and Beth F. Sturley of Syracuse.       
         Florence Stephenson Mahoney, an unwavering advocate for national health research and programs, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Washington. She was 103.         Working with the philanthropist Mary Woodard Lasker, Mrs. Mahoney was instrumental in the growth of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services through which the federal government finances medical research.         Starting as the one-room Laboratory of Hygiene on Staten Island in 1887, the agency, now comprising 27 institutes and centers for specific topics, is housed on a 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Md. Its budget for 2002 is $23.4 billion.         After World War II, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker lobbied to enlarge the agency, then a single institute. ''It is hard to realize today that government-subsidized research in the 1940's, when Florence Mahoney started her efforts, actually was controversial,'' said Judith Robinson, author of ''Noble Conspirator: Florence S. Mahoney and the Rise of the National Institutes of Health'' (The Francis Press, 2001).         With charm and persistence, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker pressed powerful politicians to support research on health issues.         ''When I wanted to get things done, I started at the top,'' Mrs. Mahoney told Ms. Robinson.         And the top often meant the president, whether it was Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson or Jimmy Carter.         Jack Valenti, a friend of Mrs. Mahoney, was a special assistant to the president in the Johnson administration.         ''When I would tell him that Mary Lasker and Florence Mahoney wanted to see him, the president would groan,'' Mr. Valenti said. ''He'd say, 'Oh, my God, these two women are going to bankrupt this country.' And they usually got what they wanted out of him.''         Eventually, the women focused on specific areas, with Mrs. Mahoney taking a special interest in aging and mental health.         In the 1960's Mrs. Mahoney began urging lawmakers to create an Institute on Aging at the N.I.H. She said the institute should concentrate on improving the quality of the lives of older Americans, not just their longevity.         In 1972, Mrs. Mahoney persuaded Senator Thomas F. Eagleton and Representative Paul G. Rogers to sponsor a bill creating such an institute. It passed, but President Richard M. Nixon would not sign it.         The next year, the bill was reintroduced, and Mr. Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal, again would not sign the measure. But Mrs. Mahoney kept up her efforts.         In the spring of 1974, the bill was passed a third time, and on May 31, 1974, Mr. Nixon signed it, just months before he resigned under the threat of impeachment.         ''There would not be an Institute on Aging without Florence Mahoney,'' Mr. Eagleton said. ''She was the creator and instigator of it. I was simply her messenger.''         Florence Amelia Sheets was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., on April 20, 1899, the eldest of three daughters born to Abraham L. and Julia T. Stephenson Sheets. She later adopted her mother's maiden name as part of hers.         Ms. Robinson wrote that Mrs. Mahoney remembered feeling a sense of social responsibility for the first time at age 10 when she was riding in a friend's pony cart.         ''There was an orphans' home nearby, which we passed once,'' Ms. Robinson quoted Mrs. Mahoney as saying. ''We didn't know what it was, so one time we thought we'd stop and find out. We went in, and I'll never forget it; I can still see it. Everything was gray. Even the children were all gray. It was all so depressing. That was my first feeling of social conscience.''         After graduating from Muncie High School in 1917, she enrolled in the Battle Creek Normal School of Physical Education in Michigan, where she studied anatomy and kinesiology. She taught physical education in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and studied dance in New York with an Italian ballet master whose students included Fred Astaire. She also took medical courses.         On Oct. 13, 1926, she married Daniel J. Mahoney, a Cox newspaper executive who became publisher of The Miami Daily News. They had two sons and divorced in 1950.         Mrs. Mahoney moved to Washington, turning her Georgetown house into a sort of salon, where politicians and scientists discussed issues over dinner.         Dr. Robert N. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, said that the dining room table was on the small side and that he believed it was by design, to encourage robust discussion.         Mrs. Mahoney's house had another claim to fame. Mr. Valenti, now the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said ''The Exorcist'' was filmed there.         Mrs. Mahoney is survived by a son, J. Michael Mahoney of Larkspur, Calif., and grandchildren.       
         Dolly Dawn, a big-band vocalist whose honey-sweet voice each noon, six days a week, bounced invitingly across America in the late 1930's and early 40's, died last Wednesday at a nursing home in Englewood, N.J. She was 86.         Her death was announced this week by her family.         She was one of the first vocalists to become the sole focus of a band, at a time when bands and musicians were still the main draw. Ella Fitzgerald called Miss Dawn an influence on her own singing. Joe Franklin, the New York radio and television personality, said in an interview that when Walter Winchell coined the term ''canary'' for female singers, he was referring to her.         She sang first with George Hall and His Orchestra, and then with a group carved out of the band called ''Dolly Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol.'' Later, she played clubs, dance halls and street fairs, among other engagements, all over the United States.         But Miss Dawn dropped out of the limelight and became known mainly to the cult following that saw her in scattered club appearances in the 1970's and 80's, and responded to the release of a two-disk album of her records with George Hall on the RCA Bluebird label in 1976.         There was another revival of interest in her after Sony's reissue of some of her hits, most recently a collection called ''You're a Sweetheart'' in 2001. Paper dolls of her are sold on eBay.         She received almost no royalties for her reissued recordings, obtained only minimal Social Security and suffered in recent years from diabetes and kidney failure, Peter Sando, her nephew, said. She had lived in a transient hotel in Manhattan before being given an apartment and other assistance by the Actors' Fund, also in Manhattan. She moved to the Actors' Fund Nursing Home and Assisted Living Care Facility in Englewood earlier this year.         Theresa Maria Stabile was born on Feb. 3, 1916, in Newark and grew up in Montclair, N.J. Both her parents were Italian immigrants and her father ran a restaurant, among other jobs. Her cousin was the bandleader Dick Stabile. At 14, she won an amateur contest that Hall held in Newark. He shook her hand, but had forgotten her a year or two later when she showed up at the Taft Hotel in Manhattan, where his band regularly played. With the regular female vocalist about to leave, Ms. Dawn auditioned and got the job. She was known at the time as Billie Starr. Mr. Hall and Harriet Mencken, a writer on The New York Journal-American, came up with Dolly Dawn.         ''She's as fresh as the dawn and as dimpled as a doll,'' the newspaperwoman said, according to an article in Radio Guide in 1937. Miss Dawn never stopped hating the name, which she thought made her sound like a stripper.         After six months of musical training, she began singing with Hall's band in July 1935, which every day but Sunday was broadcast nationally on CBS radio from the Taft Hotel at noon. The show's tagline: ''Dance With Romance.'' Her relationship with Hall and his wife was so close that they formally adopted her when she was 19. In a ceremony on July 4, 1941, he turned his band over to her and became her manager.         She returned the loyalty. Tommy Dorsey asked her to sing with his band, but she turned him down, said Ronald Knoth, a social worker who helped her during her later years.         A popular part of the band's performance had become her appearing with just seven musicians in a group she named Dawn Patrol, after a newspaper column Ed Sullivan wrote called ''Along the Dawn Patrol.'' Sullivan, a friend, gave her permission.         Ms. Dawn never married, saying that her music was her husband and children. She is survived by her sister, Ida Sando, of Spring Lake, N.J.       
         Lucy Grealy, the poet and essayist who wrote a noted 1994 memoir, ''Autobiography of a Face,'' about her experience growing up with extreme facial disfigurement and repeated surgery to repair it, died at a friend's house in Manhattan on Wednesday night. She was 39.         No cause of death was announced. Friends said she had been despondent over operations she underwent two years ago.         Reviews of her memoir stressed that it was not simply a medical history or a cry of anguish but a distinguished contribution to the literature of the self.         In The New York Times, Margo Jefferson wrote: ''So many memoirs make you feel that you've been sealed up inside a wall with a monomaniac. A really good one, like 'Autobiography of a Face,' makes you feel there is more to ask and learn. You are not just seeing the writer; you are not trying to see yourself. You are seeing the world in a different way.''         In the book, Ms. Grealy described how she underwent surgery at 9 for what seemed to be a dental cyst, but which led to a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, a rare and virulent cancer. After several more operations, half her jaw was gone, and only flesh remained on the lower right side of her face. But with radiation and chemotherapy, she survived.         Over the next 18 years she underwent about 30 more operations to rebuild her face. Older boys at her school would yell, ''That is the ugliest girl I have ever seen.'' She herself concluded, ''I was too ugly to go to school.''         But she was also proud and determined, Ms. Grealy wrote.         Lucinda Margaret Grealy, whose last name is pronounced GRAY-lee, was born in Dublin to Desmond and Trena Anne Grealy. She and her twin sister, Sarah Louise, were the youngest of five children, who included her older brothers, Sean and Nicholas, and another sister, Suellen. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1967 when she was 4.         In addition to her twin, Sarah Louise Barasch, she is survived by her mother and two siblings who live in London, her brother Nicholas and her sister Suellen Grealy Vlaveanos.         After settling the family in Spring Valley, N.Y., her parents saw themselves as fallen aristocrats. They had been well-known journalists in Ireland -- her father had helped found RTE, Ireland's national broadcasting organization -- and then they felt stuck in the suburbs. Mr. Grealy commuted to work as a producer for ABC and CBS in New York, while Mrs. Grealy stayed home, rearing the children.         Ms. Grealy felt at first that by suffering heroically, ''I could save the entire family.'' But as her endless and crushingly expensive ordeal continued, she realized that her face, more than her own and her family's fortune, was her very self-image and life.         ''When my face gets fixed, then I'll start living,'' she said she told herself.         She graduated in 1981 from Spring Valley High School, earned a B.A. in 1985 at Sarah Lawrence College, where her interest in reading and writing poetry deepened, and in 1987 went to the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. She spent 1991-92 on a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, where she completed her memoir.         As a result of publishing her book, Ms. Grealy saw her life in a different way. She felt she had gotten her message out, that she had found herself, that her face had become acceptable, Ms. Barasch, her twin, said. The book, which sold well, was published internationally and widely adopted in high school and college curriculums. In 1995 it won Ms. Grealy a Whiting Award, given to provide financial support to young writers of exceptional talent.         Ms. Grealy taught at Bennington College and New School University and published poetry in various magazines. In 2000 she published a second book, ''As Seen on TV,'' a collection of essays about her family and her experiences.
