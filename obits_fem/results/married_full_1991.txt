         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Princess Ileana of Romania, who was known as Mother Alexandra after becoming a nun, died at midday yesterday in St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, Mother Christophora, abbess of the Monastery of the Holy Transfiguration, said.         An aunt of former King Michael of Romania, she was 82 years old and had been a nun at the monastery, which is a community of nuns of the Orthodox Church in America in Ellwood City in western Pennsylvania, for 22 years.         Mother Alexandra, who founded the convent in 1968 and was its abbess from 1969 to 1980, fractured her hip in a fall there on Jan. 4, entered the hospital that night, suffered a massive heart attack on Jan. 8 and died of heart failure, Mother Christophora said.         She was born Jan. 5, 1909, the youngest of the five children of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Romania, and was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.  Brother Becomes King         Her eldest brother became King Carol II of Romania, and at his behest she was married in her early 20's to Archduke Anton of the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and left Romania. She returned to her homeland in 1940 but was forced to leave in 1948 by the Communist Government.         She eventually came to the United States, carrying an heirloom diamond and sapphire tiara wrapped in a nightgown, and settled in Newton, Mass. She divorced the Archduke, who had served in the German Air Force during World War II, in 1954 and supported herself and her children by giving lectures on such topics as her life, Romania and world peace.         Her second marriage, to Dr. Stefan Issarescu, ended in divorce and then, with her children grown up, she became a nun of the Orthodox Church in the convent of the Protection of the Holy Virgin in Bussy-en-Othe in east-central France before going on to found the convent in Pennsylvania. After retiring as abbess at that convent, she continued an active life there and as a speaker on religious topics around the country.         She traveled to Romania in September, her first visit since 1948, to see the graves of her parents.  Author of Several Books         Her writings include a volume of memoirs, "I Live Again" (1952), and several books on spiritual and religious subjects including "Meditations on the Nicene Creed" (1958).         She is survived by three daughters from her first marriage, Alexandra, who lives in West Germany, and Magdalene and Elisabeth, who live in Austria; and two sons, Stefan, of Detroit, and Dominic, of Venice.         The former King Michael, who was ejected from Romania by the Communists shortly before Princess Ileana, now lives in Geneva.       
         Charlene Victor, the executive director of BACA, the Brooklyn Arts Council, died on Monday at her home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. She was 71 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, the council's public relations director, Chuck Reichenthal, said.         In 1966, Ms. Victor founded BACA, a community-based cultural organization, as an outgrowth of her work with the Prospect Park Centennial Committee. BACA has sponsored many arts events in Brooklyn.         Ms. Victor was born in Chicago and moved to New York when she was 16 to pursue a careeer in the theater. Using the stage name Charlene Harris, she appeared in several Broadway shows, and performed on radio and television. She worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, and with Imogene Coca, Bob Fosse and Mel Brooks. She retired from the theater in the late 1940's and married Eugene Victor, a Brooklyn politician.         She received awards for her work in the arts from several organizations, including the New York Board of Trade and the Arts and Business Council. In 1987, she was awarded the New York State Governor's Art Award.         She is survived by two sons, Adam and Damon, of New York; a brother, Melvyn Harris of Chicago; a sister, Betty Zamore of Ventura, Calif., and three grandchildren.       
         Ruth Dietz, who headed the Woolen Corporation of America in the 1950's, died on Monday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Dietz, a native of Manhattan, took over direction of the Woolen Corporation in 1950 on the death of her first husband, Louis Surut, who founded the concern in 1920.         In 1952 she married Arthur O. Dietz, president of the CIT Financial Corporation, who died in 1967.         Mrs. Dietz is survived by a daughter, Elaine Fenton of Manhattan; a son, Lee E. Surut of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, Monroe Rubinger of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ralph Rubinger of Palm Beach, Fla.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Esther Fisher, a classical pianist, died here last Tuesday. She was 90 years old.         No cause of death was given.         She was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, and went to London in 1919. Ferruccio Busoni, the Italian pianist and composer, encouraged her to study with Isidore Philipp in Paris.         She later studied with Artur Schnabel in Berlin. She made her debut in London in 1923.         She became a professor at the Royal College of Music in London and married Sir John Barran in 1946. He died in 1952.

         Dame Margot Fonteyn, whose blend of refinement and passion redefined 20th-century ballet style and made her an international idol as the prima ballerina of the Royal Ballet in Britain, died yesterday in Paitilla Hospital in Panama City. She was 71 years old and lived on a farm near La Quinta Pata, Panama.         Jane Hermann, the director of American Ballet Theater, said that she had been told of Dame Margot's death by telephone by Querube Brillenbourg, the ballerina's stepdaughter. Mrs. Brillenbourg said that Dame Margot had been ill for two and a half years but gave no further details. The Associated Press reported that Louis Martins, a friend of Dame Margot, said she did not want people to know she had cancer.         The impact of Dame Margot's career was so strong that successive generations of viewers identified her with distinct phases in their own dancegoing experience.         Most associated her with one of the greatest ballet partnerships in history when she and Rudolf Nureyev dazzled audiences in the 1960's and 1970's. Performing regularly, sometimes annually, in the United States for 15 years, the team was unsurpassed in critical acclaim, box office success and public adulation.         But Dame Margot was a superstar in her own right long before the term came into use. She sealed the reputation of the young British company that became the Royal Ballet when she conquered New York in 1949 as the radiant Princess Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty." The English-born ballerina was associated with the growth of British ballet since 1934, and her effortless artistry was equated with a British style.         Dame Margot was also known as the muse of England's great choreographer, Sir Frederick Ashton, who created many of his major works for the young dancer whom he helped develop. Together they defined the lyrical side of 20th-century classicism in ballet. And yet as Dame Margot often demonstrated in her dancing, the ballerina with the openly well-bred style was also capable of a rush of passion -- an emotional outpouring that she made unforgettable in "Swan Lake," "Romeo and Juliet" and "Marguerite and Armand," which Sir Frederick choreographed as a vehicle for her and Mr. Nureyev in 1963.         Dame Margot was known for her musicality, beauty of line, inner radiance and refinement. Most of England's leading male dancers were her partners, and as noted by one, Michael Somes, their wish was to act as cavaliers -- to step back and to show her off. Sacheverell Sitwell, the British poet and essayist, said Dame Margot could be compared only "to a bird of beautiful plumage taking pleasure and exulting in its wings."         The New York Times dance critic John Martin analyzed her artistry in 1953 when he wrote: "She has a muscular awareness of the phrase which automatically translates music into movement, and her scale is beautifully sensitive, so that there is endless color in her movement. But beyond this, there is a feeling for choreographic form that gives shape and substance to the composition of what she is dancing, to a degree that one has never seen equaled in the ballet."  Studied Dance as a Child         Dame Margot was born Margaret Hookham in Reigate, Surrey, on May 18, 1919. Her father was an English engineer; her mother was half-Irish, half- Brazilian. As a child, she studied at dancing schools in the London area.         Her family moved around (she lived in Kentucky at one point), and when her father found work in China, she studied with George Goncharov, a Russian-born dancer who had settled in Shanghai. When she began to show talent, she and her mother returned to London, where she attended the school attached to the Vic-Wells Ballet (as the Royal Ballet was then known).         The teen-ager made her debut with the Vic-Wells as a snowflake in "The Nutcracker" in 1934. Borrowing her mother's maiden name, she initially danced as Margot Fontes, but soon modified her stage name to Fonteyn. Her brother, Felix, a photographer, also adopted Fonteyn as a professional name.         In 1935, Dame Margot received her first solo role, that of Young Tregennis, a doomed aristocrat, in "The Haunted Ballroom," a ballet by Ninette de Valois, the founder of the Royal Ballet. That same year, Sir Frederick created the role of the bride for her in "Le Baiser de la Fee." At the time, she told her mother: "Frederick Ashton is absolutely mad. His steps are impossible," but the dancer and the choreographer established an astonishing rapport. And Dame Margot later said, "There can be no doubt that my happiest moments on stage have been in Ashton ballets."         Sir Frederick often cast her as a frail or otherworldly being. In "Apparitions" (1936) she was an artist's unattainable vision, while in "Nocturne" (1936) she portrayed a poor flower seller wistfully watching rich people at a ball. But Sir Frederick also gave her a comic role in "A Wedding Bouquet" (1937), emphasized her charm in "Les Patineurs" (1937) and made her a classical soloist in such abstractions as "Symphonic Variations" (1946) and "Scenes de Ballet" (1948).         Other Ashton ballets in which she created starring roles included "Daphnis and Chloe" (1951), "Sylvia" (1952) and "La Peri" (1956). She charmed the public in Sir Frederick's "Ondine" (1958), which concerned a water spirit in love with a mortal, and she singled out the work as "my happiest ballet."  Widening Her Range         The ballerina herself noted that she had difficulty with styles foreign to her temperament. She was defeated by the speed necessary for the main role in George Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial." But she widened her range successfully and dramatically when she performed as a guest artist with Roland Petit's company in Paris in 1948.         Dame Margot appeared in productions by several contemporary choreographers, among them Sir Kenneth MacMillan's version of "Romeo and Juliet." In 1975, she danced in Martha Graham's "Lucifer" as a guest artist with the Graham company in Manhattan. She also excelled in classics like "Swan Lake," "Giselle" and Michel Fokine's "Firebird," which she imbued with a flashing brilliance.         Her most memorable classical portrayal was that of Princess Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty." The Sadler's Wells Ballet (as the Vic-Wells was renamed before it became the Royal Ballet) made its United States debut in 1949 with the 1890 classic by Marius Petipa. The full four-act version was virtually unknown in this country. Dame Margot, then 30 years old, stunned the audience in the Metropolitan Opera House with her performance as the youthful Aurora.         "When she comes bounding in with all the young joyousness in the world at her first entrance in the birthday party scene," Mr. Martin, the Times critic, wrote, "the lights somehow seem to become brighter and the air fresher, and you know you are in the presence of magic."         Dame Margot's partners over the years included British ballet's major male dancers, among them Mr. Somes, Robert Helpmann and David Blair. Then in 1962, when she was 42 and was reportedly giving thought to retirement, she starred with Rudolf Nureyev, a 23-year-old defector from the Kirov Ballet of Leningrad, in the Royal Ballet's production of "Giselle," and an electrifying new partnership developed.  'She Represents Eternal Youth'         Dame Margot declared of Mr. Nureyev: "Something quite special happens when we dance together. It's odd because it's nothing we discussed or worked on, yet there in the photos both heads will be tilted to exactly the same angle, both in perfect geometric relationship to each other." And Mr. Nureyev said of Dame Margot, "For me, she represents eternal youth."         Sir Frederick created "Marguerite and Armand" (1963), an adaptation of Dumas's "Dame aux Camelias," for the stars, and they danced together with the Royal Ballet and as guests with other companies. Dame Margot continued to be a globe-trotting ballerina until the late 1970's, after which she made occasional guest appearances in mime roles; during the New York season of La Scala Ballet in 1981, she was Lady Capulet in "Romeo and Juliet."         Dame Margot married Dr. Roberto Arias, a Panamanian diplomat, in 1955. Nine years later, he was nearly paralyzed in an assassination attempt, and even as she maintained a strenuous performance schedule, Dame Margot devoted herself to his care until his death in November 1989.         She was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and Dame of the Order of the British Empire in 1956. The Royal Ballet also officially named her its prima ballerina, although that title has rarely been used outside Russia in the 20th century.         Dame Margot, who occasionally coached younger dancers, helped members of the Houston Ballet in "Swan Lake" in 1989. On May 30, 1990, the Royal Ballet offered a gala performance of "Romeo and Juliet" in her honor at the Royal Opera House at which Sylvie Guillem and Jonathan Cope portrayed the young lovers and two of Dame Margot's former partners were seen in supporting roles. Mr. Nureyev was Mercutio and Mr. Somes came out of retirement to play Lord Capulet.         Dame Margot was the author of "Margot Fonteyn: An Autobiography" (1975) and "The Magic of Dance" (1979), based on a widely seen television series on dance history for which she was the commentator.         Summing up her career in her autobiography, she said: "My attitude has never changed. I cannot imagine feeling lackadaisical about a performance. I treat each encounter as a matter of life and death. The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference between taking one's work seriously and taking one's self seriously. The first is imperative and the second disastrous."         In addition to Mrs. Brillenbourg, of New York City, and her brother, Felix, of London, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Rosita Arias, and a stepson, Roberto Arias, both of Panama.       
         Marcella Markham, a Brooklyn-born actress who had stage and television careers in New York and London, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 68 years old and had homes in both cities.         She died of breast cancer, her husband, Irving Palmer, said.         Miss Markham made her first Broadway appearances in the early 1940's, playing a small role in "Vicki" and then in "Flamingo Road." In 1946, Eugene O'Neill chose her to play Cora, one of three female featured roles, in "The Iceman Cometh."         During the play's run she married Dr. Frank Kingdon, an educator, columnist and co-chairman of the Progressive Citizens of America. The couple were blacklisted and in 1951 moved to England, where Miss Markham appeared on stage and television." She was Rudolf Nureyev's dialogue coach during the filming of "Valentino."         She had roles in the Off Broadway production of "The Threepenny Opera" in 1954, in "Are You Now or Have You Every Been" in 1978 and in "A Conflict of Interest" in 1979. Most recently, she played the character Beatrice for two years in the American television series "General Hospital."         Miss Markham's marriage to Dr. Kingdon ended in divorce. She is survived, in addition to Mr. Palmer, by a son, Tom Kingdon, and a grandson, Nathaniel.       
         Virginia Mae Brown, who as chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission became the first woman to head an independent administrative agency of the Federal Government, died Sunday at her home in Charleston, W. Va. She was 67 years old.         The cause of death was a heart attack, said her daughter, Pamela Kay Brown.         Mrs. Brown, a lawyer, served as an I.C.C. commissioner from 1964 to 1979, was vice chairman of the commission in 1968 and was named chairman for a one-year term in 1969.         Mrs. Brown, an appointee of President Lyndon B. Johnson, also was the first woman to serve on the commission, which was founded in 1887.         She was also the first woman to be an assistant attorney general for West Virginia, a post she held from 1952 to 1961. After serving from January to May 1961 as counsel to Gov. William W. Barron of West Virginia, she became the state's first female insurance commissioner. And in 1962 she became the first female member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission. An Administrative Law Judge         After leaving the I.C.C. in 1979, Mrs. Brown returned to West Virginia, where she was an administrative law judge for the Federal Department of Labor in Charleston and later for the Social Security Administration there.         Mrs. Brown, whose maiden name was the same as her married name, was born in Pliny, W. Va., and graduated from the University of West Virginia in 1945. She then enrolled at the university's law school, one of two female students there at the time, and graduated in 1947.         After receiving her law degree in 1947, she served as law clerk to Ira J. Partlow, then the West Virginia Attorney General.         Her marriage to James V. Brown, a Charleston lawyer, ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter Pamela, a law student at the University of Tulsa, Mrs. Brown is survived by another daughter, Victoria Anne Hunt of Charleston; a sister, Annabelle Brown of St. Albans, W. Va., and six grandchildren.

         Katinka Loeser, many of whose short stories were infused with what a critic described as "autobiographical sketches of warmth and charm," died Wednesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Westport.         She died of kidney failure, said her daughter, Jan DeVries.         Miss Loeser published three collections of stories, most of which first appeared in The New Yorker: "Tomorrow Will Be Monday: Stories of Parents and Children" (1964); "The Archers at Home" (1968), about a suburban couple afflicted with empty-nest syndrome, and "A Thousand Pardons" (1982), stories about a Westport couple who enjoy their lives and the changing seasons.         Miss Loeser was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on July 2, 1913, and grew up in Chicago. She started writing poetry when she was 14. In 1943 she won the Young Poet's Prize of Poetry magazine, and her poems later appeared in The New Yorker. She was notified of the Young Poet's Prize in a telegram from the editor of Poetry, the humorist Peter DeVries, whom she married later that year.         In an interview in 1982, Miss Loeser maintained that it is more difficult to write short stories and poetry than novels. With a poem, she said, "You're thinking in abstract terms and trying to get a rhythm." In a novel, she added, "There is more leeway." But to be a successful writer of any kind, she added, "you have to be a decent reader from the time you're small."         At the University of Chicago, from which she graduated in 1936, Miss Loeser studied under the playwright Thornton Wilder, one of her favorite teachers. When she taught a writing class at the Westport Division of Continuing Education in the 1970's, she adopted the Wilder method of reading his students' stories out loud, anonymously, and having the other students critique them.         Miss Loeser is survived by her husband and three children: Jan DeVries of Media, Pa.; Peter Jon, of New York City, and Derek, of Santa Monica, Calif. Another daughter, Emily, died of leukemia in childhood and is remembered in Miss Loeser's story "Whose Little Girl Are You?" and in Mr. DeVries's book "The Blood of the Lamb."       
         Jean Tennyson Boissevain, an operatic soprano and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland. She was 86 years old.         She died in her sleep, her goddaughter, Dorothy Blencowe, said.         Mrs. Boissevain appeared, as Jean Tennyson, with several leading European and American opera companies, including La Scala in Milan, the Chicago Civic Opera and the San Francisco Opera Company. She also sang on the CBS Radio program "Great Moments in Music" from 1942 to 1946.         Mrs. Boissevain was born in Chicago and married Camille Dreyfus, the founder and chairman of the Celanese Corporation of America, in 1931. After his death in 1965 she served as president of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, which supports scientific education and research. Her second husband, Ernest W. Boissevain, died in 1984.         After World War II, she founded the Artists Veterans Hospital Programs of the Musicians Emergency Fund, which presented concerts for patients in veterans hospitals. She also served as a patron of the Philharmonic Society of New York and as vice chairman of the Lewisohn Stadium Concerts.         Mrs. Boissevain received several awards, including the Italian Stella della Solidarieta and the St. Olaf Medal from the King of Norway.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dagmar Freuchen-Gale, an artist and illustrator for such fashion magazines as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, died March 9 at a hospital in Fredensborg, Denmark. She was 83 years old and had lived in Fredensborg since the early 1970's.         She died as the result of a stroke, a friend, Donald Gaynor, said.         Mrs. Freuchen-Gale came to New York from the town of Lyngpy, outside Copenhagen, in 1938 and worked for various magazines. She also taught fashion illustration at the Art Students League for 20 years, from the late 1940's.         In 1943 she married Peter Freuchen, a Danish Arctic explorer and author.  She wrote "Cookbook of the Seven Seas" (1968), and also edited several of her husband's books. Mr. Freuchen died in 1963. In 1967 she married Henry Gale, a New York lawyer He died in 1969.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Lola Popper Kramarsky, former president of Hadassah, the national women's Zionist organization, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kramarsky was president of Hadassah from 1960 to 1964 and was active in the organization for much of her adult life. Her particular concerns were with Youth Aliyah, which rescues and rehabilitates displaced children, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centr in Jerusalem.         She retired from active Hadassah involvement in 1985. At her death she was an honorary vice president of the organization, whose current membership is 385,000.  Owned Noted Art Collection         With her husband, Siegfried, a banker and philanthropist who died in 1961, Mrs. Kramarsky owned an art collection that was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and included works by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Seurat and Gauguin.         Violet Ingeborg Else Popper was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of an importer who died in 1917. A twin brother was killed in action with the German Army in World War I. With her husband, whom she married in 1921, and children she left Germany in 1932, fleeing the rise of Hitler and anti-Semitism.         The Kramarskys came to the United States from the Netherlands in 1940, aided by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, a family friend who became the first president of Israel.         Mrs. Kramarsky is survived by two sons, Bernard, of Great Neck, L.I., and Werner, of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Sonia Kramarsky of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and three-great grandchildren.       
         Ruth Page, a pioneering American ballet dancer and one of the first ballet choreographers to employ American subject matter, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 92 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, said Andrew Mark Wentink, her biographer.         Miss Page, who arranged Rudolf Nureyev's New York debut by engaging him for one of the companies she directed, was involved with an almost bewildering array of activities. She performed with Anna Pavlova's classical ballet company, with Serge Diaghilev's avant-garde Ballets Russes and with German Expressionist modern dancers.         She appeared in opera houses around the world, danced at the coronation of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1928 and gave programs in the Soviet Union in 1930. But she remained proudly American, making Chicago the base of her activities and refusing to change her name at a time when many Americans adopted exotic stage names.  Wide Range as Choreographer         An eclectic choreographer, Miss Page is known for "Hear Ye, Hear Ye" (1934), a ballet about a murder trial to a commissioned score by Aaron Copland; "An American Pattern" (1937), a feminist protest against conformity; "Billy Sunday" (1948), a ballet derived from a fiery evangelist's sermons, and several ballets based on famous operas.         During the 30's, her partner was Bentley Stone, an American choreographer with whom she occasionally collaborated on works. Their most enduring achievement is "Frankie and Johnny," which was inspired by a bawdy old ballad about love and betrayal. Since its premiere in 1938, it has been successfully revived by many companies, including Dance Theater of Harlem. Reviewing a production by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1947, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, "It convinces you of its human truth even while you are chortling at its crude and uninhibited sentimentalities."         Miss Page was born in Indianapolis on March 22, 1899, the daughter of Dr. Lafayette Page, a brain surgeon, and Marian Heinly, a pianist. Her parents encouraged her desire to dance and sent her to study with local teachers. In 1914, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova was a guest at the Page house and was so impressed by Miss Page that she encouraged the teen-ager to make dancing her career. Miss Page appeared briefly with Pavlova's company that year.         Moving to Chicago, Miss Page studied with Adolph Bolm, a former member of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes who had settled in America and was staging productions both for Chicago companies and for his itinerant Ballet Intime. In 1919 Bolm choreographed "The Birthday of the Infanta" for Miss Page, one of the first 20th-century ballets with a score by an American composer (John Alden Carpenter) and scenery by an American designer (Robert Edmond Jones).  In a Stravinsky Premiere         Bolm and Miss Page again made history in 1928, when she portrayed Terpsichore in the world premiere of Stravinsky's "Apollo," choreographed by Bolm in Washington months before George Balanchine created his more familiar version of the ballet for Diaghilev.         Miss Page married Thomas Hart Fisher, a well-to-do Chicago lawyer, in 1925, and on her honeymoon in Europe danced with Diaghilev's company. While she was with the Ballets Russes, Balanchine choreographed two divertissements for her, "Etude" and "Polka Melancolique," which are believed to be his first works created for an American.         Always curious about dance forms, Miss Page studied with Mary Wigman, the great German Expressionist choreographer, in 1930. In 1933, she toured with another important German modern dancer, Harald Kreutzberg.         During the 1940's, she staged works in Chicago and for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She choreographed "Revanche," a ballet version of "Il Trovatore," for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees in Paris in 1951, and "Vilia," an adaptation of "The Merry Widow," for the London Festival Ballet in 1953. Their success prompted her to found the Chicago Opera Ballet in 1956, a touring company that featured ballets inspired by operas and operettas. Yet it also presented internationally known stars in classial excerpts. It was with this troupe that Mr. Nureyev made his New York City debut in 1962. Later known as Ruth Page's International Ballet, it continued until 1970.  An Annual 'Nutcracker'         In Chicago in 1965, Miss Page staged a production of "The Nutcracker" that remains an annual event in that city. She frequently revived her works for regional companies and directed the Ruth Page Foundation School of the Dance, which will continue under the direction of Larry Long.         Miss Page's first husband, Mr. Fisher, died in 1969. She married the French artist and stage designer Andre Delfau in 1983. Miss Page was the author of "Page by Page" (1980) and "Class" (1984). She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1980 and the Illinois Gubernatorial Award in 1985, and held honorary degrees from Indiana University, De Paul University and Columbia College of Chicago.         She is survived by her husband and a brother, Dr. Irvine Page of Hyannis, Mass.       
         Louise Dickinson Rich, the author of "We Took to the Woods," a best seller during World War II, died on Tuesday at her daughter's home in Mattapoisett, Mass. She was 87 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Dinah Anderson, said.         "We Took to the Woods" was a witty account of a Thoreau-like existence in a wilderness home in northwestern Maine.         Mrs. Rich was born in Huntington, Mass., and grew up in Bridgewater, where her father was the editor of a weekly newspaper. She met Ralph Eugene Rich, a Chicago businessman, on a Maine canoe trip in 1933 and they married a year later. Mr. Rich died in 1944.         Mrs. Rich wrote a number of books for adults and children, among them "Only Parent" (1953), "Innocence Under the Elms" (1955) and "The Coast of Maine" (1956).         She is survived, in addition to her daughter, by a son, Rufus, of Dresden, Me.; a sister, Alice D. Hoke of Mattepoisett, and a grandson.       
         Katya Delakova, a dancer and choreographer who specialized in Jewish themes, died Wednesday at her home in Titusville, N.J. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, her husband, Moshe M. Budmor, said.         Born in Vienna, Miss Delakova graduated from the Academy of Music and Dance. She performed and toured Europe with Gertrud Kraus, a modern dancer, until fleeing the Nazis and immigrating to New York in 1939.         In 1942, she married Fred Berk, a dancer with whom she presented programs of Jewish dance. She began the first classes in Jewish folk dance at the 92d Street Y and with her husband created the Jewish Dance Repertory Group. They also conducted folk dance festivals for the Hebrew Arts Committee at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         Miss Delakova lived in Israel from 1953 to 1958 after her divorce from Mr. Berk. It was there, after studying with Moshe Feldenkreis, that she became interested in Eastern movement disciplines, such as Hatha Yoga, which she also taught. From 1966 to 1975, she headed a program called "The Art of Moving" at Sarah Lawrence College.         She is survived by her husband, a former professor of music at Trenton State College.       
         Martha Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of this century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Miss Graham died of cardiac arrest after being treated for two months for pneumonia, said Ron Protas, general director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Miss Graham had become ill in December after a 55-day tour of the Far East with her troupe. She entered the hospital on Jan. 15 and returned home two weeks ago.         Frequently ranked with Picasso, Stravinsky and James Joyce for developing a form of expression that broke the traditional mold, Miss Graham was initially acclaimed as a great dancer. Masterworks and Invention         Yet ultimately her genius -- universally recognized as she became the most honored figure in American dance -- was embodied in her choreographic masterworks and her invention of a new and codified dance language.         The Graham technique, which is now used by dance companies throughout the world, became the first enduring alternative to the idiom of classical ballet. Powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension, this vocabulary combined with Miss Graham's distinctive system of training to set her above other dance innovators.         Although such achievements were part of Miss Graham's multi-faceted pioneering role in helping to establish modern dance outside the older ballet tradition after the 1920's, she continued to amaze her public for more than 60 years. She choreographed more than 180 works. The most recent was her self-mocking "Maple Leaf Rag," which had its premiere on Oct. 2 with the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.         Throughout her career, Miss Graham's fundamental tenet was that dance should reach audiences through a visceral response rather than an objective image that registered upon the intellect. "Out of emotion comes form," she said, and then proved that out of form she could re-create the same emotion onstage.         She never wavered in her belief that movement could express inner feeling. Miss Graham sought to give "visible substance to things felt" and to "chart the graph of the heart." These celebrated Graham phrases became the metaphors central to her art.         Miss Graham's dances spoke elo- quently against the crushing of the human spirit, and one of her frequent themes was the condemnation of intolerance, especially toward nonconformists.         Her own life as a creative artist epitomized the independent spirit with which she so frequently imbued her dramatic heroines. The figure conquering sexual fear in "Errand Into the Maze," the woman looking deep into herself while preparing for an unnamed fate in "Herodiade" and the American pioneer brimming with optimism in "Frontier" could also be Clytemnestra or Jocasta, antiquity's queens who -- in the Graham canon -- emerged from crisis through the sheer force of self-understanding. Miss Graham usually cast herself at the center of these works until 1969, when she gave her last performance and retired reluctantly from the stage at the age of 75.         Because she rarely met conventional expectations about dance, she was both misunderstood and acclaimed. She was surrounded by debate throughout her career; few remained indifferent to her. Acknowledgment of Miss Graham's role as a dominant force in all the arts at first came from painters, writers, musicians and the acting profession. Gregory Peck and Bette Davis were among the many drama students she taught over the years at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Graham to perform at the White House in 1937, and in 1976 Miss Graham became the first dance personality to receive, from President Gerald R. Ford, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.         Nonetheless, Miss Graham's highly intense dancing and choreography were not intended to soothe the spirit and did not find ready acceptance. Quest for Inner Reality, But Never for Realism         Like Picasso, she was concerned with an inner reality. "For me, dance is theater," she wrote. But she never resorted to a realistic theater. More often than not, her choreography presented a dancer's body as distorted or dislocated, an assemblage of forms aligned into maximum expressiveness.         Audiences throughout the world were often disturbed by Miss Graham's frank acknowledgment of human sexuality, especially in her famous cycle inspired by Greek myths. Miss Graham's Medea, Jocasta, Phaedra and Clytemnestra gave vent to their lust and hate, baring the passions that few humans liked to recognize in themselves but that Miss Graham exposed with the unflinching scrutiny of a 20th-century Jungian analyst.         For Miss Graham, dance became a collective memory that could communicate the emotions universal to all civilizations: mythology, she felt, was the psychology of the ancients.         Miss Graham's encyclopedic approach to dance -- a creative wellspring from sources as varied as American Indian rituals to the Bible -- often carried several levels of meaning and startled a public that defined dance in linear or pictorial terms. Miss Graham, for her part, said she wanted her dances to be "felt" rather than comprehended in the usual manner.         In 1944, John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote of the emotional effect that the Graham dance theater could have upon the viewer. He warned that "Deaths and Entrances," the choreographer's study of turbulent passions inspired by Anne, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, the 19th-century English writers, was "un-understandable through the usual organs of understanding" and "slips in through sensory perceptions." The Graham Technique Is Based on Breathing         In general, Miss Graham saw art as a reflection of its time inseparable from life. "My dancing," she said, "is not an attempt to interpret life in the literary sense. It is an affirmation of life through movement."         Even the dance technique that she hammered out on her own body and then transferred to her school and company derived from the most organic aspect of human life: the act of breathing. That act was formalized and dramatized in the idiom's most basic principle, called contraction and release -- intensified moments of exhalation and inhalation. Miss Graham said her aim was "to increase the emotional activity of the dancer's body so that you are teaching the body, not teaching the mind."         The contraction, originating in the dancer's pelvis, created the percussive angular movement and sexual tension that invariably startled a newcomer to the Graham repertory. But it is the Graham idiom as a whole that can look strange to those who expect more of a continuum in dancing. Being 'the Thing Itself' Instead of Portraying It         Above all, she said, "Dance is not representational." Miss Graham recalled in later years that as a young dancer about to embark upon an independent career in 1922, she had chanced upon a nonfigurative painting by Wassily Kandinsky -- a slash of red against a field of blue. "I will dance like that," she said.         Like other modernists, Miss Graham rejected literal imagery in favor of abstraction. Form for form's sake, however, held no interest for her. Instead she focused on abstraction in its strict sense, that of extracting the essence of a quality of emotion. A celebrated example was "Lamentation," the 1930 solo in which Miss Graham, encased in a tube of stretch jersey, created sharply angular shapes on a bench. She did not dance about grief, but sought to be what she called "the thing itself" or the embodiment of grief.         Miss Graham's gift for the distilled image ranged over her entire career. In "Cave of the Heart" (1946), her Medea was the personification of hate, consumed by the venom of jealousy as visualized in snakelike contours.         The quintessential Graham could be found in "Frontier" (1935), one of the choreographer's pieces on overt American themes. The solo initiated her 32-year collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.         The set for "Frontier" was a fragment of a fence seemingly anchored by a rope behind. It had the same spareness and economy of Miss Graham's solo and the score of her music director and mentor of that time, Louis Horst. Noguchi noted in general that he had found in Miss Graham "a drive that motivated her to strip the dance to its stark rudiment." Noguchi's Sets Sought 'A Limitless Illusion'         Both artists shared an affinity for forms that looked abstract and were resonant with multiple meanings. Writing in 1984, Noguchi said that for "Frontier" he had "thought to catch the essential sculpture of space -- a limitless illusion." He continued: "This is the path I continued to investigate whenever Martha would call on me to rise to the occasion. She is the one who always came to me with her requirements and the myth she wished to encompass. My role was to respond."         Miss Graham's work revealed an integrated vision. She began using contemporary scores for the company she formed in 1929. After 1934, she tended to use commissioned music and was guided here by Horst, a composer who insisted that dance had a life independent of music and did not derive from it. Miss Graham herself, sometimes accused of using dance as mere aural decor, often said that she did not seek to interpret another art form -- that is, music.         Among the composers who wrote scores for Miss Graham were Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Aaron Copland, whose score for her 1944 classic, "Appalachian Spring," won the Pulitzer Prize.         Martha Graham, the eldest of three daughters, was born on May 11, 1894, in Allegheny, Pa., to George Graham, a physician who specialized in mental disorders, and the former Jane (Jenny) Beers, a descendant of Miles Standish. In 1908, the family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif. Started Dance Training At 22, After Father Died         In 1916, after the death of her father and after graduation from a junior college, the Cumnock School, Miss Graham enrolled in the Denishawn school in Los Angeles and then joined the Denishawn Company. Denishawn, organized by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, was then the only major dance company that worked outside the classical ballet tradition, and it became the incubating ground for such pioneering talents as Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Miss Graham herself.         John Murray Anderson saw Miss Graham with Denishawn and hired her for his Greenwich Village Follies in 1923 and 1924. But in those two years Miss Graham realized that neither Denishawn, with its exotic pretexts for dances, nor the commercial theater was right for her. At the invitation of Rouben Mamoulian, she joined the dance division of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she taught dance.         On April 18, 1926, she made her concert debut at the 48th Street Theater in New York with works that still showed the influence of Denishawn. "The idiom," the critic Robert Sabin recalled in 1953, "was still prevalently romantic and eclectic, but the spirit was new and as bracing as a salty sea wind."         Miss Graham taught in the early years in her studio at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 13th Street, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She assembled a company of women. Because the members had to support themselves, they would work on new works for nine months, then give a few recitals in New York and go on tour.         From her group, augmented by men in 1938 to 1939, came the next generation of modern dancers, choreographers and teachers: Anna Sokolow, Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, May O'Donnell, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham and later Paul Taylor and John Butler. Miss Graham, who had a long-term relationship with Horst, was married in 1948 to Mr. Hawkins. They separated in the early 1950's and were later divorced. Received Financial Help From Many Individuals         Before World War II, Miss Graham took on outside assignments. In 1930, she was the Chosen One in Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski and choreographed by Leonide Massine. A few years later she collaborated on dramatic productions with Blanche Yurka, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, and Archibald MacLeish.         Troubled by the recurring financial problems that were endemic to an art form struggling for acceptance, Miss Graham was helped over the years by individual patrons. Among them were Frances Steloff, founder of the Gotham Book Mart, whose $1,000 loan made the initial 1926 concert possible, Miss Cornell, Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace and, most recently, Halston. Mrs. Wallace made it possible for the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance to acquire the building at 316 East 63d Street, where the Graham school is situated.         In the early years, Miss Graham costumed herself and the women in her troupe in stretch jersey. She later referred to this time as her "long woolens" period. Her dances were spare and stark, testimony to her deep interest in ritual, and she was strongly influenced by the ceremonial Indian dances she had witnessed in the Southwest. These experiences were reflected in such works as "Primitive Mysteries" and "El Penitente," which remain in her company's repertory. From American Themes To Ancient Mythology         In the 1930's, Miss Graham was known for her American themes. "We must look to America to bring forth an art as powerful as America itself," she said, and produced such works as "American Document," "American Provincials," "Appalachian Spring," "Letter to the World" and "Salem Shore."         After 1946, she immersed herself in Hebrew and Greek mythology with "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey," "Errand Into the Maze," "Judith," "The Witch of Endor," "Phaedra" and, most powerfully, the full-evening "Clytemnestra" of 1958. She picked up historical personages with legendary qualities, the Bronte sisters for "Deaths and Entrances" and Joan of Arc for "Seraphic Dialogue."         As the years progressed, Miss Graham was loath to leave the stage. Since she was the central figure on that stage, she eventually began to create roles for herself that were less physically demanding. After her retirement from dancing, her new works rarely focused on a protagonist.         Repeatedly acclaimed as a choreographer, she always considered herself a dancer first. After relinquishing her roles to younger dancers, she continued to direct her company. She made triumphant tours to the Far East and Europe under Government auspices and, in her 80's and 90's, increasingly traveled abroad with her company. Her tour last fall took in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Congressional Propriety Offended by 'Phaedra'         It was on a European trip in 1962 that she ran afoul of two United States Representatives, Edna Kelly of Brooklyn and Peter Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. They saw "Phaedra" in Bonn and, apparently not knowing the Greek legend of a queen's passion for her stepson, protested that the work was too explicit to be a proper cultural export for the United States.         Although Miss Graham was identified with a new art form that initially rejected classical ballet as being inadequate for contemporary expression, she collaborated with ballet's leading personalities.         In 1959, the New York City Ballet presented "Episodes," consisting of two sections to Webern's music. George Balanchine choreographed one half and Miss Graham the other. In 1975, just before Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev appeared as guests in her company, she declared, "The war has ended," alluding to the perceived conflict between modern dance and ballet. Further proof came when Mikhail Baryshnikov appeared as a guest with her troupe from 1987 to 1989.         Among Miss Graham's awards were the first Guggenheim Fellowship given to a dancer; the Kennedy Center Honors; the Aspen Award in the Humanities; the Capezio Dance Award; the first Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award to honor achievement in modern dance; the Meadows Award in the performing arts; the Handel Medallion of New York City; the Henry Hadley medal for contribution to American music, and the first National Medal of Arts.         In 1987, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave Miss Graham the Ingenio et Arti medal, a rarely awarded honor and her country's highest distinction for contributions to the arts and sciences. Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, personally decorated her in 1984 with the Legion of Honor at the Paris Opera. She received a number of honorary degrees, from Yale, Harvard and other universities.         Miss Graham liked to emphasize that her work and private life were separate. "I have always fought against any dramatization of my peculiarities or my personality," she said. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Lask noted it was through her work "that she had, in William Faulkner's apt phrase, put a scratch on the face of eternity."         Martha Graham was living proof of her own adage: "No artist is ahead of his time. He         is         his time; it is just that others are behind the time."         Miss Graham leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Tatiana du Plessix Liberman, the leading hat designer for Saks Fifth Avenue for 20 years, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan and Warren, Conn.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Liberman, whose original name was Tatiana Yacovleff, was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 7, 1906, into a professional family that found sanctuary in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. She studied painting and sculpture, but also learned millinery to earn a living.         She was married to a French diplomat, Bertrand de Plessix, from 1929 until 1940 when he was killed by the Germans in their conquest of France.         She fled to New York with their daughter in 1941 and began designing hats for Henri Bendel. Within a year, she joined Saks Fifth Avenue and became head of its custom hat salon, designing with the signature Tatiana du Plessix until its Salon Moderne closed in 1963.         The designs were often praised by fashion reporters as irresistible. In 1950, Virginia Pope of The New York Times hailed the milliner as "a perfectionist" in assembling both materials and colors and for artful originality in flattering women of many types. The 1951 collection, Miss Pope wrote, excells in "both wit and wisdom."         In 1942, the designer married Alexander Liberman, an artist and editorial director of Conde Nast Publications. Mr. Liberman was an adolescent friend and fellow Russian emigre in Paris.         They kept close ties with friends from the Paris days and later with prominent Soviet artists who settled in the West, including Joseph Brodsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The couple's homes were also gathering places for friends like Salvador Dali, John Gunther, Marlene Dietrich and Christian Dior.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Liberman is survived by a daughter, the writer Francine du Plessix Gray, of Warren, Conn., a sister, Lila Duchess of Caylus, France, and two grandsons.       
         Jean Harder Ryan Shields, a longtime hospital volunteer, died on Tuesday at her home, Panther Ledge Farm in Allamuchy, N.J. She was 76 years old.         She was a past chairwoman and a member of the Assistant Board of Woman's Hospital since 1949. In 1965 she became a member of the board of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan.         Her first husband, Clendenin J. Ryan, a financier, died in 1957. In 1969, she married William Shields Jr., a senior partner of Coudert Brothers law firm. He died in 1979.         Mrs. Shields is survived by two sons, Robert Ryan of Asbury, N.J., and Cyr Ryan of Oldwick, N.J.; two daughters, Caryn Tuckerman of Manhattan, and Jean Sadler of Manns Harbor, N.C., 17 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Wilhelmina Harris, for nearly four decades the superintendent of the Adams Presidential Family National Historic Site in Quincy, Mass., died on May 20 at her home in Quincy. She was 95 years old.         She died of a heart ailment, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service said.         Mrs. Harris had been associated with the heirs of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams since the early 1920's, when she became social secretary to Brooks Adams, a historian and a fourth-generation family member who died in 1927.         In 1948 Mrs. Harris joined the staff of the historic site, which includes the birthplace of both Presidents and the summer White House they maintained. She was named superintendent in 1950 and served until she retired in 1987 at the age of 91.         Mrs. Harris was born in Franklin, Ala., and was a graduate of Montevallo College in Alabama.         Her husband, Col. Frank E. Harris, whom she married in 1928, died in 1947. Surviving are three sons, Frank 3d of Salt Lake City, George, of Washington, and Brooks, of Philadelphia; 11 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Coral Browne, an actress who had leading tragic and comic roles on the stage, mostly in London, and played urbane characters in occasional films, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 77 years old.         She died of breast cancer, and her husband, the actor Vincent Price, was at her bedside, a family spokesman said.         The Australian-born actress with chiseled features and a patrician manner began appearing with the Old Vic in London in 1951 in such Shakespearean plays as "Othello," "King Lear," "Troilus and Cressida," "Hamlet" and "Macbeth."         With equal ease, she also starred on the West End over the decades in such American hits as "The Man Who Came to Dinner" and "My Sister Eileen" through "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Toys in the Attic."  An Early Start, Long Run         In films, Miss Browne was the cynical and tippling actress and friend of the title character in "Auntie Mame" in 1958. She also appeared in "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" (1961), "Dr. Crippen" (1964), "The Night of the Generals" (1967), "The Killing of Sister George" (1968) and "The Ruling Class" (1972). She essayed the horror film in "Theater of Blood" in 1973. Her co-star was Mr. Price, to whom she was married a year later.         Coral Edith Browne was born on July 23, 1913, in Melbourne, Australia, and studied art and scenic design. At 17, she filled in for an actress and liked it so well she changed direction, appearing in 28 plays in Australia. She received a 21st-birthday trip to London from her father, a restaurateur, started working in the theater and never stopped.         In 1984, she won Britain's best-actress award for her performance in Alan Bennett's television film "An Englishman Abroad," which was based on her own encounter with the British spy Guy Burgess in Moscow in 1958 while she was touring with the Old Vic in "Hamlet."         Miss Browne also triumphed in 1985 in "Dreamchild," playing the octogenarian who as a girl had inspired Lewis Carroll to write "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." She is survived by her husband.       
         Elizabeth Jay Hollins, an author who wrote under the name Elizabeth Etnier, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hollins wrote "On Gilbert Head," a critically praised journal of her life in the 1930's with her first husband, the painter Stephen Etnier, on an island in Maine.         The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1948 she married Harry B. Hollins. She published short stories and a novella, and in 1966 she edited "Peace Is Possible: A Reader on World Order." Achieving world peace was a cause for which she worked closely with Mr. Hollins, who died in March.         She was born in New York and graduated from Barnard College.         She is survived by two daughters, Stephanie Doane and Victoria Villamil; a stepson, Harry Hollins; four stepdaughters, Elizabeth Aldrich, Lilias Outerbridge, Evelina Kats and Angelica Braestrup; a brother, Peter Jay; three sisters, Sybil Waldron, Augusta Huffman and Katharine Bacon, and four grandchildren.         A memorial service is to be held at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, at 4 P.M. on Thursday.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Jean Arthur, the buoyant actress whose piquant charm and infectious laughter enriched some of the finest comedy dramas of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at the Carmel Convalescent Hospital in Carmel, Calif., where she lived for 35 years. She was 90 years old.         Miss Arthur died of a heart ailment, a family spokeswoman said.         Miss Arthur had a bubbly flair for reflecting the absurdities of life, a subtle vulnerability and a voice that wavered unpredictably between the spunky and the amiable.         The classic films she graced included three by Frank Capra -- "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" -- and also George Stevens's "More the Merrier" and Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair."  A Marshmallow Heart         Miss Arthur's winsome talent was brightest in roles where her hard-boiled career woman's exterior masked a marshmallow heart, as when she first exploited and then inspired such country bumpkins as Gary Cooper as Mr. Deeds and James Stewart as Mr. Smith in their uphill challenges to greed and corruption.         The actress's honesty made even implausible scenes and films appear credible. A shy perfectionist, she was invariably self-critical of her performances, refused to pose for cheesecake photographs, rarely granted interviews and was often suspended by Columbia Pictures for rejecting roles. "I just couldn't act in a bad picture," she once said.         She began acting on the Broadway stage and returned in 1950 for a widely praised performance in the title role of "Peter Pan," Sir James M. Barrie's 1904 fantasy about the lad who refused to grow up. The production had 321 performances, one of the longest runs for the classic. Interpreting 'Peter Pan'         The hit prompted Miss Arthur to drop her guard and give an interviewer this interpretation of the theme: "Peter represents the youth in all of us: the freshness and originality of childhood before our parents and schoolteachers have pressed us into a mold. Barrie meant that we should not let that 'genius of childhood' escape us, not let our neighbors and the man at the corner grocery store do our thinking for us. If I can get over the message that we should all try to be ourselves, to be free individuals, then I'm sure I'll have accomplished what Barrie wanted."         The actress, who was originally named Gladys Georgianna Greene, was born on Oct. 17, 1900, in Plattsburg, N.Y., and grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Her father was a photographer. When pressed by Hollywood to choose a stage name, she selected one honoring two idols: Jeanne d'Arc and King Arthur.         She attended George Washington High School and soon became a successful advertising model, which led to a movie test and contract. She acted in dozens of silent two-reel comedies, melodramas and westerns. Easily making the transition to sound, she played ingenues in a spate of comedies, adventure yarns and melodramas. In three of them, she had to cope wih the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (played by Warner Oland).  Back to Hollywood         But unhappy with her roles and determined to master her art, Miss Arthur returned to New York in the early 1930's and acted for several years on the summer theater circuit and Broadway in a total of 14 plays. Most were flops, but critics began to laud her maturing talent.         She won a contract with Columbia Pictures, returned to Hollywood and her comic talents blossomed in "The Whole Town's Talking," a 1935 gangster yarn of mistaken identity.         Miss Arthur credited Frank Capra with nurturing her skill in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). In the first comedy, playing a reporter, she humiliates a naive well-meaning heir -- played by Mr. Cooper -- and then saves him from his greedy tormentors at a sanity hearing. In "Mr. Smith," as a secretary, she deceives an artless young senator (Mr. Stewart), but later uses her parliamentary expertise to aid his filibuster and defeat his foes.         Other comedy successes included "Easy Living," "You Can't Take It With You," "The Devil and Miss Jones," "The Talk of the Town," "The More the Merrier," in which she, with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, wrestled with the housing shortage in World War II Washington, and "A Foreign Affair." She was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in "More the Merrier."         The actress also won plaudits for roles in such films as "Diamond Jim," "The Plainsman," "History Is Made at Night," "Only Angels Have Wings," "Arizona" and later, in 1953, in "Shane," about the disturbing effect of a gunfighter (Alan Ladd) on a frontier family, with Miss Arthur playing a gentle and loyal wife and mother.         At the peak of her career, in the mid- 1940's, she began studying many liberal-arts subjects at colleges. "All my life," she said, "I've wanted to make enough money so I could stop and be a student for a while. The only real reason for living is doing what you want to do, or trying to, anyway." Years later, she taught acting at Vassar College.         Her later stage appearances were frustrated by directorial and cast disputes and illnesses. On television, she played an urbane lawyer in "The Jean Arthur Show" in 1966, but the scripts were more far-fetched than funny.         Her elusiveness led to contrasting stories about her self-doubts and later psychoanalysis with Dr. Erich Fromm. In 1972, she remarked, "I guess I became an actress because I didn't want to be myself."         Miss Arthur was married twice, to Julian Anker, a photographer, in 1928, and to Frank Ross, a producer, from 1932 to 1949. Both marriages ended in divorce.         In later decades, she spent most of her time at her coastal retreat in Carmel, where she once remarked, "I have a very good life" with some good friends, a brood of cats and "the sea on three sides of me."         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Joan Caulfield, an actress who starred in films of the 1940's and in television situation comedies of the 1950's, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.  She was 69 years old and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         She died of cancer, a hospital spokesman said.         Miss Caulfield was propelled to stardom by the films "Monsieur Beaucaire," in which she appeared with Bing Crosby, and "Blue Skies," with Bob Hope, both released in 1946, and by "Dear Ruth," appearing opposite William Holden, in 1947. On television she was a co-star of "My Favorite Husband," on CBS from 1953 to 1957, and "Sally" on NBC in the 1957-58 season.         Miss Caulfield, who was a native of West Orange, N.J., attended Columbia University and was a fashion model and a cover girl before she landed ingenue roles on Broadway in the early 1940's. Her first stage success was in the 1943 production of the comedy "Kiss and Tell," in which she appeared for 14 months. Paramount Pictures promptly offered her a contract and she began her Hollywood career with "Miss Suzie Slagle's," in 1946. Occasional Film Appearances         Her films made the most of her beauty, although she was determined to win a reputation as an actress and not, as she said, "just a decoration."         In 1950, Miss Caulfield married the film producer Frank Ross and subsequently appeared only occasionally in films. She and Mr. Ross were divorced in 1960. She later married Robert Peterson, a dentist, from whom she was also divorced.         She is survived by two sons, Caulfield Kevin Ross of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and John Caulfield Peterson of Sacramento, Calif.; two sisters, Mary Parker of Stuart, Fla., and Elizabeth Victor of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  June 21, 1991, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Joan Caulfield, the actress, reversed the identities of the male stars in two films. Bing Crosby starred in "Blue Skies," Bob Hope in "Monsieur Beaucaire."       
         Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.         For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.         In 1946, she became a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald, now defunct. She wrote a sociey column, "Under My Hat," and later wrote a syndicated column, "From the Capital." She was also a commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System.         She and William Randolph Hearst Jr., chairman of the Hearst Corporation, were married in 1948. Her first marriage, to Igor Cassini, the designer, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Hearst, who left the newspaper business in 1956, wrote "The Horses of San Simeon," (San Simeon Press, 1985), a book about breeding and raising horses.         She was a graduate of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in Baltimore.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, William Randolph Hearst 3d, publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, and Austin, of Manhattan, vice president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, a division of the Hearst Corporation, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Correction:  June 25, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter whose husband is the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, misstated the occupation of her first husband, Igor Cassini. He was a newspaper columnist. (Oleg Cassini, the designer, is Igor Cassini's brother.)       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Lee Remick, the elegant actress who illumined dozens of films and many stage and television plays, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 55 years old.         The actress died of cancer after fighting the disease for two years, a spokesman for the family said. In one of her last public appearances, a star was dedicated in her honor in April on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.         Ms. Remick, an uncommonly versatile performer, portrayed characters as disparate as a seductive cheerleader and a tormented alcoholic, along with such historical figures as Lady Randolph Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt.         Once billed as "America's answer to Brigitte Bardot," she was as much admired for her acting abilities as for her bubbly attractiveness. Writing in The New York Times of her performance in the 1980 television movie "The Women's Room," John J. O'Connor said, "Lee Remick proves once again she is an uncommonly gifted actress whose somewhat fragile, almost stereotyped good looks tend to distract one from that fact."         Ms. Remick, who was born in Quincy, Mass., studied dance as a child and won her first acting job at age 16 with a summer-stock company on nearby Cape Cod. This led to a part in a short-lived Broadway comedy, "Be Your Age," in 1953, several more summer-theater appearances and a string of television roles on "Philco Playhouse," "Hallmark Hall of Fame," "Playhouse 90" and other programs in the mid-1950's. 'I Chucked School'         Later in her career, when asked about her decision to give up school in favor of acting, she said: "I'd cut classes to go to rehearsals, then stay up all night studying, but it wasn't working, and one day a very kind teacher advised me to choose one or the other. I guess the strain was showing. Anyway, it was an easily made decision. I chucked school, told my parents and then slept for 10 days."         After the director Elia Kazan cast Ms. Remick as a seductive cheerleader in his 1957 film, "A Face in the Crowd," she gave highly praised performances in Martin Ritt's "Long Hot Summer" (1958), Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) and Mr. Kazan's "Wild River" (1960). Her portrait of a happily married housewife turned alcoholic in Blake Edwards's "Days of Wine and Roses" (1963) brought her an Academy Award nomination. Subsequent film roles included "Baby the Rain Must Fall" (1965), "Loot" (1972), "Sometimes a Great Notion" (1972) and "The Europeans" (1979).         She chose her roles with care. "After 'Anatomy,' in which I played a kind of tramp, for instance, I could have followed up with more of the same," she told an interviewer. "Reinforcing my 'image' by becoming a sex symbol would have been one way to be more strongly identified as a star, but I had no interest in doing that. I can't be something I'm not." On Broadway and Television         Ms. Remick's most successful Broadway performance was in Frederick Knott's 1966 thriller, "Wait Until Dark," about a blind woman at the mercy of three criminals. Her other stage credits included "Anyone Can Whistle," the 1964 musical by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim, and a Boston production of John Pielmeier's play "Agnes of God" in 1982.         Ms. Remick was a frequent star in television mini-series in the 1970's and 80's. She played the title role in "Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill" (1975) and also starred in "Ike" (1979), "Haywire" (1980), "Toughlove" (1985) and "Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder" (1987).         Reviewing Ms. Remick's performance in "Nutcracker," a 1987 NBC mini-series in which she played a woman who manipulates her son into committing murder, Mr. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times: "If she had been born with Bette Davis eyes or Katharine Hepburn cheekbones, she might long ago have been recognized as one of this country's most outstanding dramatic actresses."  Of Preparation and Humility         Ms. Remick was known to prepare intensively for her roles, attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for her work in "Days of Wine and Roses" and spending a month of blindfolded mornings at New York's Lighthouse for the Blind before starring in "Wait Until Dark."         "I'm really a housewife who is incidentally an actress," Ms. Remick told an interviewer. On another occasion she said: "People tell me that I have a special quality in films, but if I do I take no intellectual credit for it. It's pure instinct. I think I've held on to certain qualities within myself which have been strong."         Ms. Remick's marriage to William A. Colleran, a producer and director, ended in divorce in 1969. Her survivors include her husband of 21 years, Kip Gowans, a producer; a daughter, Kate Colleran Sullivan; a son, Matthew Remick Colleran; two stepdaughters, Justine Gowans Solly and Nicola Gowans, and her mother, Pat Packard.         Correction:  July 29, 1991, Monday         An obituary on July 3 about the actress Lee Remick omitted one of her survivors. He is her brother Bruce Waldo Remick of Springfield, Va.       
         Armina Marshall, an actress, a playwright and a co-administrator of the Theater Guild whose career on Broadway spanned more than half a century, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Philip Langner.         For nearly four decades beginning in the early 1920's, Miss Marshall, together with her husband, Lawrence Langner, and Theresa Helburn, co-founders of the Theater Guild, guided the subscription company through its glory years as one of the most successful producers of Broadway plays.         Miss Marshall and Mr. Langner, who had been married 37 years when he died in 1962, were the co-authors of seven plays, three of which made it to Broadway, including the 1933 hit "Pursuit of Happiness."         Miss Marshall, who was part American Indian, was born on the Cherokee Strip in what was then the Oklahoma Territory and spent her early school years in Pawnee, where her father was the sheriff. The family moved to the West Coast, and she attended the University of California at Los Angeles and taught school in Brawley, Calif., while playing small parts at local theaters.         She moved to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and in 1922 was introduced to Mr. Langner, a patent lawyer.         Miss Marshall was accepted into the Theater Guild and acted in several plays in succeeding years. In 1925 she and Mr. Langner were married. With Miss Helburn, a drama critic and director, the Langners built the Theater Guild into a Broadway powerhouse that by the time of Miss Helburn's death in 1959 had produced 190 attractions in New York City, in nine other cities across the country and in London.         The guild brought dozens of memorable productions to Broadway. Perhaps the most celebrated was "Oklahoma!" in 1943. The show, which blended narrative and song with ballet, transformed American musical theater almost overnight.         Among the outstanding playwrights whose work the guild produced were George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O'Neill, S. N. Behrman, Robert Sherwood and Maxwell Anderson. Actors who were guild regulars ranged from James O'Neill, Eugene's father, to Eva Le Gallienne, Claudette Colbert, Humphrey Bogart, Judith Anderson, Shirley Booth and Judy Holliday. Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne acted together in 19 guild-produced plays, Mr. Lunt alone in 4 others and Miss Fontanne alone in 2.         Miss Marshall was the associate director of "Theater Guild of the Air" for its eight-year run on radio and of "The U.S. Steel Hour" for eight years on television.         Miss Marshall's theatrical interests extended well beyond the guild. In World War II she was a founder of the Stage Door Canteen in Washington. She was also a founder of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., and a director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Fund, with which she was active until five years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Miss Marshall is survived by two granddaughters.         Correction:  July 23, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary headline yesterday about Armina Marshall, an actress and playwright, misstated her connection with the Theater Guild. She was a co-administrator, not a co- founder.       
         Helen Meany Gravis, who won the gold medal in women's 3-meter springboard diving at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, died Sunday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, according to her sister, Louise Holmes of Riverside, Conn., her only surviving relative.         Helen Meany won her first national Amateur Athletic Association diving championship as a 15-year-old in 1920 and qualified for the Olympics that year in Antwerp, Belgium. She won no medals there, nor at the 1924 Games in Paris. In Amsterdam, she became the first American woman to compete in three consecutive Olympics.         She won 17 national championship diving medals from 1920 through 1928 and was named to the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1971.         In 1946, she married Haywood Gravis and they made their home in San Antonio, until his death in 1957.       
         Carol Laise, an American Ambassador who was the wife of an American Ambassador and the first woman to be an Assistant Secretary of State, died yesterday at her home in Dummerston, Vt. She was 73 years old.         Miss Laise died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She was named Ambassador to Nepal by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 and remained in the post until 1973. In January 1974 she married Ambassador at Large Ellsworth Bunker, a 79-year-old widower, in Katmandu, Nepal. She kept her maiden name professionally.         It was the first marriage between two American Ambassadors. Miss Laise was a close friend of Mr. Bunker's first wife, Harriet Allen Bunker, who died in 1964, and it was Miss Laise's first marriage.         For nearly six years after their marriage the couple saw each other only once a month when Ambassador Laise would take a plane provided by President Johnson and fly to Saigon, where Ambassador Bunker was trying to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam. Named Director General         In October 1973 she returned to Washington and was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Bureau of Public Affairs, the first woman to hold so high a post in the department. Before her appointment as Ambassador to Nepal she had been director of the Office of South Asian Affairs,         In 1974 Miss Laise became director general of the Foreign Service, the highest nonpolitical job in the Foreign Service, a post she held until she retired in 1977.         Caroline Clendening Laise began her Government career in 1940 as an occupational coder for the Civil Service Commission. In 1946 she went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1948 joined the State Department.         From 1956 to 1961 she was an adviser to American delegates to various United Nations agencies and in 1962 was made deputy director of the Office of South Asian Affairs with responsibilty for diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India and Pakistan.         In comparing the economic problems of Nepal with those of India, she said in a 1966 interview with Ann Terry Pincus of The New York Post, "You could explain that Nepal is like Appalachia, and India has the problems of Harlem." An Adviser in New Delhi         When Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey went to India and Pakistan in 1965, Miss Laise went along as his adviser. In the 1962-63 Chinese invasion of India, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith sent for Miss Laise for advice and she spent about a year in New Delhi.         She was a winner in 1965 of the annual Federal Women's Award for outstanding contributions by women in government service, and in 1973 she received the Career Service Award of the National Civil Service League.         Miss Laise, a native of Winchester, Va., was a graduate of American University and received an M.A. in political science from George Washington University.         Her husband, Ambassador Bunker, died in 1984.         She is survived by a brother, Frederick Laise of Santa Fe, N.M.; two stepsons, Samuel Bunker of Dummerston, Vt., and John Bunker of Wheatland, Wy.; and a stepdaughter, Ellen Bunker of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.       
         Gisela Warburg Wyzanski, a leader in Zionist women's and youth activities for several decades, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 79 years old.         She died of leukemia, her famlly said.

         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.

         Bena Frank Mayer, a painter best known for her portraits, died on Thursday at the St. Luke's division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her lawyer, Martin Bressler, said.         Mrs. Mayer exhibited in many group shows with the National Association of Women Artists, winning several of its awards, and was a past president of the New York Society of Women Artists.         She was the widow of Ralph Mayer, also a painter and an expert in the field of artists' materials and techniques, who died in 1979. Twenty years earlier, with the support of the A.&P. heir Huntington Hartford, the couple had founded the nonprofit Artists Technical Research Institute, whose aim was to establish reliable scientific data on artists' materials. Mrs. Mayer also helped her husband research and edit several reference books he wrote for artists, including "The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques," first published in 1940 and now considered a classic in the field.         In 1990 she was instrumental in establishing the Ralph Mayer Learning Center, successor to the Artists Technical Research Institute, at the Yale University School of Art. The center supports research and writing on the use of materials and the study of artists' techniques. A show of Mrs. Mayer's landscapes and portraits was held at Yale in connection with the opening of the institute in September 1990.         Mrs. Mayer was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1898, spent her early years in Wyoming, and came to New York in 1914. She studied at the Cooper Union and the Arts Students League, and also privately with the painter Stuart Davis. She married Mr. Mayer in 1927.         There are no immediate survivors. A funeral service is to be held today at 9:30 A.M. at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.       
         Laura Riding Jackson, a poet, critic and co-founder with Robert Graves of various literary publishing ventures, died on Monday at the Humana Sebastian Hospital in Sebastian, Fla. She was 90 years old and had lived in Florida since 1938.         She died of cardiac arrest, said Theodore Wilentz, a close friend.         Born in New York City and originally named Laura Reichenthal, Miss Riding established herself as an important avant-garde poet in the early 1920's, when she attracted the attention of the Fugitives, a group of American Southern writers centered at Vanderbilt University. Members of the group included John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren.         In 1923, their magazine, The Fugitive, commended Miss Riding's first published poem for its originality, and in 1923 hailed her work as "the discovery of the year."         In praising her poetry, the critic Paul Auster wrote that "in poem after poem, we witness her trying somehow to peel back the skin of the world in order to find some absolute and unassailable place of permanence."         Later, Miss Riding joined the English poet and novelist Robert Graves, with whom she lived during the 1920's and 30's, as co-founder of a small literary publishing firm called Sezin Press, which lasted from 1927 to 1938. She and Mr. Graves also edited Epilogue, a series of volumes of criticism that contributed to a school of thought that became known as The New Criticism.         In 1938, she married Schulyer B. Jackson, the critic and former poetry editor of Time magazine, and settled in Florida. She renounced poetry at that time, "as imposing irremovable obstacles to the realizing of the full potential afforded by language."         Both because of her devotion to language and defiance of all social instituitions, the critic Martin Green once wrote, Ms. Riding became "a hero for all poets and other rebels."       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.       
         Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, great-aunt of King Hussein of Jordan and an artist best known as an abstract painter of the Paris School in the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday after a short illness. She was 89 years old.         During an artistic career that spanned more than 60 years, the princess blended elements of Islamic and Byzantine art with abstract and other influences from the West. She had exhibitions in major galleries in Paris, London and New York City.         The princess was born in 1901 in Istanbul to a prominent Ottoman family that included many artists. She began painting at the age of 14 and was one of the first women to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul.         In 1934 she married King Hussein's great-uncle Prince Zeid el Hussein, a diplomat serving as a minister plenipotentiary in Turkey for his brother King Faisal I of Iraq. He died in 1970.         She is survived by a son, Prince Raad bin Zeid, and two children from a previous marriage: another son, Nejad Devrim of Warsaw, a painter, and a daughter, Sirin Devrim Trainer of New York City, an actress.

         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Virginia Hoff Greenburg, a pianist, music teacher and co-founder of the prestigious Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale, N.Y., died on Friday at the Hospice of the Central Coast in Carmel, Calif. She was 91 years old.         She suffered a stroke at her home in Carmel on Sept. 14 and was in a coma until her death, family members said.         In 1944 she and the composer Joyce Barthelson founded the school with a few students in a private house in Scarsdale. Over the years it grew to occupy various annexes throughout the town. In 1972, it moved into its current home, the 36-room former Scarsdale Inn.         The school, which is for many a hub of Westchester musical life, now has 65 faculty members and 1,200 students and gives more than 200 concerts and recitals yearly, including those by the Philharmonia Virtuosi and the pianist Peter Serkin. It also has an extensive outreach program serving the elderly and the handicapped. Still Playing Near the End         Mrs. Greenburg was the director and driving force at the school for nearly 30 years before retiring in 1973, turning over its direction to Mary Helton, who had taught there since 1951.         Her first husband, Charles Hoff, died in 1949. In 1972, she married Reginald Greenburg. Soon after, they went to Carmel for a visit and soon moved there.         An accomplished pianist as well as teacher, she and Ms. Barthelson gave many two-piano recitals at the school and elsewhere. Even as her health began to fail in recent years, she kept playing. Shortly after her 90th birthday, she recorded herself performing Chopin Preludes and sent tapes to many relatives and friends.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Her sons, Hubert and Christopher, both died in 1974.         A memorial service at the school is being planned for next month.       
         Jane Dewey Ellsworth, founder of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation, died last Friday at her home in Westlake Village, Calif., near Los Angeles. She was 80 years old.         Her family said the cause of death was emphysema.         Mrs. Ellsworth, a native of Greenfield, Mass., studied speech and drama at Smith College and had a brief stage career in stock and in bit parts on Broadway. She was under contract to Paramount Studios for two years and, at the time, wrote some magazine fiction.         She was married for a time to Patric Farrell, who in the 1920's and 30's was director of the Irish Theater at Sheridan Square and an Irish arts museum in Manhattan. In 1938, after they had divorced, she married Whitney Ellsworth, writer and producer of the old "Superman" television series.         The Ellsworths were living in Greenwich, Conn., in the early 1950's when her 15-year-old daughter by her first marriage, Patricia, developed myasthenia gravis. Mrs. Ellsworth's concern with the nerve disorder, which is characterized by muscular weakness and fatigue, especially in the face and the neck, prompted her to form the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation. The foundation, organized in New York in 1952, now has headquarters in Chicago and has 53 chapters around the country.         Mrs. Ellsworth's daughter, a Barnard College graduate and former editor for the Encyclopedia Americana in New York, is now Patricia Wilson, a resident of Holland, Mich. Mrs. Ellsworth's first husband, Mr. Farrell, lives in Manhattan. There are no other immediate survivors.       
         Hallie Burnett Zeisel, a novelist, college teacher and co-editor of Story magazine from 1942 to 1971, died on Wednesday at the Steward Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 years old.         She died of causes related to a stroke she suffered two years ago, said her daughter, Whitney Voss.         The novelist, who was professionally known as Hallie Burnett, made her reputation as a nurturer of young talent at Story magazine.         She joined the periodical in 1942 as assistant editor and new wife of its editor and founder, Whitney Ewing Burnett. Through the 1940's and 1950's, Story published known and unknown writers alike, paying the same standard fees. Salinger, Cheever, Etc.         During her tenure, Mrs. Burnett helped publish the early short stories of writers like J. D. Salinger, John Cheever and William Saroyan.         Then there was the young soldier named Joseph Heller who entered a writing contest held by the magazine. And there were stories from Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. A Harvard freshman named Norman Mailer won a Story college-writing prize for a piece entitled "The Greatest Thing in the World."         In addition to publishing Story, the Burnetts edited anthologies of stories and fiction, along with "Story Jubilee: Thirty-Three Years of Story" (1965). The Burnetts also operated Story Press, a book-publishing concern. Story magazine closed down in 1971, and Whitney Burnett died two years later.         In 1977, Mrs. Burnett married William Zeisel, who died in 1980. Wrotes Novels and Textbooks         Mrs. Burnett's novels were "A Woman in Possession" (1951), "This Heart, This Hunter" (1953), "The Brain Pickers" (1957) and "The Watch on the Wall" (1965). She also wrote a number of textbooks, including "On Writing a Short Story," which was published in 1983.         Mrs. Burnett, whose family name was Southgate, had little formal schooling in her native St. Louis. She spent a good deal of time at colleges as the daughter and niece of trustees. She was married in the 1930's to Robert Abbott, a college teacher, but the marriage ended in divorce.         Later, she returned to campuses to teach literature and creative writing at schools like Sarah Lawrence, Wagner College, Hunter College and the University of Missouri.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, John Burnett, of Bali, Indonesia, and six grandchildren.       
         Margaret Ramsay, a theatrical agent who was a leading figure in the British theater, died on Wednesday in the London Clinic. She was 83 years old.         She died of heart and circulatory problems, her assistant, Mary Carter, said.         Miss Ramsay, known to many as Peggy, built a formidable client list in the decades she worked as an agent, representing among others the playwrights Robert Bolt, Eugene Ionesco, Alan Ayckbourn, Vaclav Havel, Christopher Hampton, Larry Kramer, Edward Bond, Caryl Churchill and David Hare. One of her best-known clients was the playwright Joe Orton; in the 1987 Stephen Frears film about Orton's life, "Prick Up Your Ears," Miss Ramsay was played by Vanessa Redgrave.         Miss Ramsay was born Margaret Venniker on May 28, 1908, in a small town near Sydney, Australia. She was raised in South Africa, where her father had inherited an ostrich farm. Around 1930, she married Norman Ramsay, a professor of psychology, and with him moved to England; shortly afterward, their marriage ended.         She entered the theater first as a singer, then as an actress, and spent some time working in theater production and management before opening her agency early in the 1950's.         Soon she was representing many of the avant-garde playwrights whose works were regularly presented at the Royal Court Theater in the 50's and 60's. It was Miss Ramsay who introduced the Romanian-born Mr. Ionesco to the English stage.         Miss Ramsay was widely admired for her devotion to good writing and social commitment, and one of her favorite admonitions to a new writer was, "Don't extract the teeth from anything, dear."         Her longtime companion, the actor William Roderick, died in April. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Claire Zeisler, an artist and art collector who helped transform the two-dimensional craft of weaving into the three-dimensional medium called fiber art, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 88 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Joan Binkley of Lake Bluff, Ill.         Mrs. Zeisler, whose maiden name was Block, was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1903, and showed a strong interest in art from childhood. In 1921 she married Harold Florsheim, an heir to the Florsheim Shoe Company, and moved to Chicago.         For a while, her interest in art was manifested in a collection that became well known for its broad range and exquisite taste. In the 1930's, she acquired paintings by European modernists including Picasso, Miro and Klee, as well as objects from many tribal cultures, among them African sculptures, tantric art, ancient Peruvian textiles and more than 300 American Indian baskets. Later, she added works by prominent postwar American artists, from Franz Kline and Robert Rauschenberg to Jenny Holzer.         In 1943 Mrs. Zeisler divorced her husband, and in 1946 she married Ernest Zeisler, a physician and author. In the 1940's she also went back to school, studying with the sculptor Alexander Archipenko and with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy at the Illinois Institute of Technology, often known as the American Bauhaus. But it was the instruction she received from a Chicago weaver named Bea Swartchild that channeled her abiding interest in textiles toward the craft of weaving. A Move Toward Complexity         At first she created functional loomed weavings, but by 1962, the year of her first solo exhibition, she had abandoned the loom to create three-dimensional free-form fiber sculptures of increasing scale and complexity. These works actively exploited the inherent qualities of weaving and thread, especially in their emphasis on knotting and wrapping and on free-falling unwoven strands of fiber, a device that the artist considered her trademark.         After a 1963 exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City that also included fiber works by Sheila Hicks and Lenore Tawney, Mrs. Zeisler came to be seen as an innovator in her field. From then on, she exhibited widely, in Europe and Japan as well as the United States, and many museums acquired examples of her work. In 1979 the Art Institute of Chicago organized a retrospective of her art; a smaller exhibition was mounted by the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two sons, Peter Florsheim of Sedona, Ariz., and Thomas Florsheim of Milwaukee; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Zaring Stone, a novelist who also wrote under the pen name Ethel Vance, died on Sunday at the Mary Elizabeth Nursing Center in Mystic, Conn. She was 100 years old and had lived in Stonington, Conn.         Three of Mrs. Stone's novels were made into films: "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," in 1933, which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther; "Escape" (1940,) with Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor and Conrad Veidt, and "Winter Meeting" (1948,) with Bette Davis.         "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," about a New England woman who arrives in China to marry a missionary but becomes a captive of a Chinese warlord, was the first movie to be shown at Radio City Music Hall.         "Escape," an anti-Nazi thriller, was written in 1939 under the pseudonym Ethel Vance. In 1942 the author said the pen name had been used to protect her daughter, Eleanor Perenyi, who was living in occupied Europe, and because Mrs. Stone's husband, Ellis, was the United States naval attache in Paris, where they were living.         The book became a best seller, and Mrs. Stone used the Vance name for some of her later books, including "Reprisal" (1942) and "Winter Meeting," (1946).         Mrs. Stone was the great-great-granddaughter of Robert Owen, the British social reformer and socialist who founded the cooperative colony of New Harmony in Indiana. Her mother died when she was born, and she spent most of her childhood "visiting around," she said.         "In all the houses of the Owen descendants there were many books being very thoroughly read and almost everyone kept diaries," she said. "Diary keeping, writing in general, was just something one did. Then I married into the Navy and of course that was very, very different. But when my husband was stationed at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, the place seemed to get me started."         She wrote an account of a hurricane, and the Atlantic Monthly bought it, and later bought a short story as well. Then "Bobbs-Merrill wrote to ask me if I had a novel in mind, by any chance," Mrs. Stone said, "and of course that was a most amazing question to me, because I'd had a novel in mind practically forever."         Mrs. Stone's first novel was "The Heaven and Earth of Dona Elena," published in 1929. Her other works included "The Cold Journey" (1934,) "The Secret Thread" (1949) and "Althea" (1962).         Surviving besides her daughter, a writer, of Stonington, are a grandson and a great-graddaughter.       
         Aline MacMahon, an actress whose stage, screen, radio and television career lasted more than 50 years, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She apparently died from pneumonia, friends said.         A veteran of 43 films, Miss MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in "Dragon Seed" in 1944, appearing as the Chinese mother to the part played by Katharine Hepburn.         A Warner Brothers casting director in 1933 placed Miss MacMahon among the 10 smartest actresses, in a class with Miss Hepburn and Helen Hayes. Miss MacMahon's beauty inspired Cecil Beaton to photograph her and Isamu Noguchi to sculpture a marble bust. 'Beauty and Vitality and Truth'         Raves acclaimed her early role in Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," in 1926. Alexander Woollcott, the critic, said she acted "with extraordinary beauty and vitality and truth." The New Yorker said she "tempted one to rank her immediately as among the Olympians." Noel Coward called the newcomer "astonishing, moving and beautiful."         Rarely did she get a bad notice, even in productions that were otherwise panned. Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times in 1967: "I have been seeing Aline MacMahon for more years than I'm going to be honest enough or ungentlemanly enough to count. Always she has pleased me, sometimes more, sometimes less, nevertheless always."         Offstage, she was equally busy. As chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater in 1950, she organized productions for community theaters. She was active in relief charities.         Miss MacMahon was born in McKeesport, Pa., and moved to Brooklyn with her family. Her father, the late William Marcus MacMahon, was the editor of Munsey's Magazine. At her urging, her mother, Jennie Simon MacMahon, began her own stage career at the age of 53. She died in 1984, three weeks before her 107th birthday.         Miss MacMahon graduated from Barnard College in 1920 and made her Broadway debut the next year in "The Mirage." Among her more memorable plays were "Pictures in the Hallway," "Once in a Lifetime," "The Eve of Saint Mark," "The Confidential Clerk" and "All the Way Home."         Her films included "Ah, Wilderness!," with Lionel Barrymore; "Gold Diggers of 1933"; "The Search," with Montgomery Clift; "The Eddie Cantor Story"; "The Lady Is Willing," with Marlene Dietrich; "The World Changes," with Paul Muni; "Five Star Final," with Edward G. Robinson; "One Way Passage," with William Powell; "Flame and Arrow," with Burt Lancaster; "I Live My Life," with Joan Crawford, and "Babbitt."         Her final role, in 1975 with Meryl Streep, was in "Trelawny of the Wells," the same play Ms. MacMahon performed at Barnard 55 years earlier.         She was married to Clarence S. Stein, the architect who helped to design Sunnyside Gardens in Queens and to plan Radburn, N.J. There are no survivors.       
         Nancy Proskauer Dryfoos, a sculptor in stone and terra cotta whose work is in the permanent collections of many museums and universities, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness with lung cancer, said her husband, Donald.         Mrs. Dryfoos had more than a dozen one-woman shows in New York, Connecticut and Washington, and her work has been exhibited in group exhibitions at institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Dallas Museum of Fine Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.         Her work is in the permanent collections of Columbia University, Brandeis University, New York University, the Boca Raton Museum in Florida, Kean College in New Jersey, and other institutions.         Nancy Edith Proskauer was born on March 25, 1918, in New Rochelle, N.Y. She graduated from Drew Seminary and Sarah Lawrence College. She and Mr. Dryfoos were married in 1938.         Mrs. Dryfoos studied at the Columbia University School of Architecture with Oronzio Maldarelli, and privately with Jose de Creeft, as well as at the Art Students League in Manhattan.         She was a winner of many awards, including the Gold Medal of Honor from the Allied Artists of America, the Edel Award for Fine Arts, and the Naomi Lehman Memorial Award.         Mrs. Dryfoos served as a member, officer and board member on many artistic and charitable organizations. She was a fellow and former officer of the National Sculpture Society; a member of, and contest juror for, the Allied Artists of America, and director of the American Society of Contemporary Artists from 1970 to 1972, among many other professional affiliations. She was also on the Creative Arts Award Commission of Brandeis University.         She is survived only by her husband.       
         Ann C. Whitman, an influential figure in the White House as the personal secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Tuesday at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Clearwater.         Mrs. Whitman died of heart failure, friends said.         "There's no question she played a vital role in the Eisenhower Administration; he really depended on her tremendously," said Robert J. Donovan, author of "Confidential Secretary: Ann Whitman's 20 Years with Eisenhower and Rockefeller" (E. P. Dutton, 1988).         Mrs. Whitman routinely worked 12 hours a day, and often seven days a week. Among her chores was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, which reached hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Recruited in 1952         Mrs. Whitman, whose maiden name was Cook, was born in Perry, Ohio, and attended Antioch College. As part of its work-study program, she went to the Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, became a secretary there and never returned to college. Her next job, which she held for 16 years, was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father was a founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company.         In the early 1950's Mrs. Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe. She was then recruited for the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952, and worked for Eisenhower through both of his Administrations.         In 1961 she worked for George Hinman, a political adviser to Rockefeller when he was Governor of New York, and became the Governor's executive assistant in 1965. In 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford named Rockefeller as Vice President, she served as his chief of staff. She retired in 1977.         Mrs. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1940 she married Edmund Whitman, her first husband's business colleague at the United Fruit Company. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1961.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Berliner Commins, a concert pianist and author, died on Monday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 102 years old.         Mrs. Commins was born in New York City and made her recital debut at Town Hall at the age of 12. She studied in New York and in Europe and had an active career for five decades. Her last concert was at Town Hall in the mid-1950's.         In 1927 she married Saxe Commins, who became editor in chief at Random House. He died in 1958. Mrs. Commins's books included a biography of her husband, "What Is an Editor?" (1978); "All About the Symphony Orchestra and What It Plays" (1961); "Lullabies of the World" (1967), and a compilation of letters exchanged by her husband and the playwright Eugene O'Neill.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Frances Commins Bennett of New Haven, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Marcia Simon Weisman, a collector admired for her discerning taste in postwar American art and as a benefactor who helped found the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 73 years old.         She died of a stroke, a spokesman for the hospital said.         Known for her instrumental role in galvanizing support for, and contributing art to, the Museum of Contemporary Art in the late 1970's and early 80's, Mrs. Weisman also gave prize works from her collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 1976 she initiated a program that resulted in the contribution by hundreds of donors of more than 8,000 works of art to Cedars-Sinai. She helped establish similar programs at medical institutions across the country. De Kooning, Warhol and Ruscha         Born in Portland, Ore., she was a daughter of Meyer Simon, who with Mrs. Weisman's brother, Norton Simon, went on to found Val Vita Food Products, a forerunner of Hunt Wesson Foods. She attended Mills College in Oakland, Calif., where she began collecting art, buying posters and prints. In 1938 she married Frederick R. Weisman, who worked with Norton Simon before he became the head of a large Toyota distributorship. Beginning in 1952 the Weismans amassed one of the finest private collections of modern art in the country at their home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         When they divorced in 1979, the couple divided their holdings, which had come to include sigificant paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings by Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Andy Warhol and others. To the National Gallery, Mrs. Weisman promised paintings by Ed Ruscha and Clyfford Still. To the Los Angeles County Museum of Art she gave works by Newman and Hans Hofmann, among others. Last year she gave Jasper Johns's "Map," perhaps the most important work in her collection, to the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.         Besides her brother, she is survived by a sister, Evelyn Simon Prell; two sons, Richard and Daniel; a daughter, Nancy, and two granddaughters.       
         Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells.         Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,         A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate. Calculated Past G.N.P.         After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.         In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.         In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.         Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.  Work in Restaurants         When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.         The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.         She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.         She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.       
         Alice R. Bachrach, a volunteer leader of numerous national social service agencies who was involved in a landmark discrimination suit, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bachrach died of cancer, her family said.         Among her early activities, she organized and was chairwoman of the Women's Division of the National Jewish Welfare Board and was a vice president of the board for 19 years. She was a board member of the United Service Organizations during World War II and the Korean war.         She also had been an honorary governor of Hebrew Union College, vice president of the New York City Y.W.H.A., vice president of the national Girl Scouts and chairwoman of its American Girl magazine, executive committee member of the New York Blood Center and a trustee of the Parsons School of Design.         Mrs. Bachrach, whose maiden name was Rothschild, was born and grew up in Manhattan and studied at Parsons. She married Alfred R. Bachrach, a prominent accounting executive and president of Temple Emanu-El, the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. Mr. Bachrach has since died.         In a landmark case 30 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach filed a religious-discrimination complaint against a Park Avenue cooperative for rejecting their application to buy an apartment. The city Human Rights Commission upheld their complaint and moved for injunctive relief, the first time the agency exercised that remedy against a cooperative.         Mrs. Bachrach is survived by her twin sons, John, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Robert, of Manhattan and Southbury, Conn., and a daughter, Ellin Gordon, of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Melissa Gold, who was active in various civic causes, including help for earthquake victims in San Francisco and was a companion of Bill Graham, the rock music impressario, died Friday in the helicopter crash near San Francisco that killed Mr. Graham and his pilot. She was 47 years old and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Gold was also a member of a prominent East Coast family. Her father, Joseph Richardson Dilworth, is a former chairman and chief executive officer of the Rockefeller Group in New York City.         Mrs. Gold was born in Washington and grew up in Princeton, N.J. She was a graduate of Radcliffe College and moved to San Francisco, where she married Herbert Gold, a writer. After a divorce, she married Robert L. Anderson, a lawyer, from who she was also divorced.         She and Mr. Graham were first acquainted about 12 years ago, her father said, and their friendship was renewed when they worked on the plans for the public welcoming of Nelson Mandela to San Francisco last year. They had recently been working on a project to provide money to improve public schools.         Besides her father, survivors include her mother, Elizabeth, of Princeton; a daughter, Nina Gold of New York City; twin sons, Ethan Gold, a student at Harvard University, and Ari Gold, a student at Columbia University; a sister, Alexandria (Lucy) Nolan of Silver City, N.M., and two brothers, Charles D. Dilworth of San Francisco and Joseph R. Dilworth Jr. of Bronxville, N.Y.       
         Sylvia Fine Kaye, a producer, lyricist and composer, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Dena Kaye of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaye, the widow of the actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man" (1945), "The Kid from Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman and Danny Kaye. There she began writing specialty material, including a Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Mr. Kaye. In 1940, the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue."         That year, she married Mr. Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for her husband and accompanied him on piano. Wit and Patter         Mrs. Kaye was known for her complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines. Most frequently cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization. "I wrote many songs for Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect love song."         For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely for her husband. She once estimated that she wrote more than 100 songs for him during their 40-year collaboration. She was also involved in the production of almost all his films. She was twice nominated fpr Academy Awards for her work on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953). Musical Comedy on Television         In the 1970's, she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. In 1979, she produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program, "Musical Comedy Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975 she was executive producer for a television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and edited "Assignment Children," a Unicef film that starred her husband.         In the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book about her life with Mr. Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She was also writing a catalogue of show-business material that she and her husband had donated to the Library of Congress.         Brooklyn College awarded her an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.         Mr. Kaye died in 1987 at age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.         Correction:  October 30, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the songwriter Sylvia Fine Kaye omitted a survivor. He is Robert Fine Forrest, of Manhattan, her brother.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Dorothea Matthews Dooling, founder and editorial director of Parabola, The Magazine of Myth and Tradition, died on Friday at her ranch in Jackson, Mont. She was 80 years old.         Mrs. Dooling had been diagnosed with acute leukemia last month, her family said.         Parabola, a quarterly magazine which Mrs. Dooling founded in 1976 in Manhattan, quickly earned a reputation as the major journal exploring myth and ancient spiritual traditions. It has a circulation of more than 100,000.         A lifelong interest in religion, mythology and folklore led Mrs. Dooling to found Parabola, each issue of which explores the quest for meaning in life through investigating a universal theme like wholeness, pilgrimage or death.         The daughter of an Episcopal bishop and a Procter & Gamble heiress, Mrs. Dooling was born in Glendale, Ohio.         In 1931, she married John Orville Dooling, a rancher and hotel owner in Jackson. Mrs. Dooling lived in Jackson until 1952, when she moved to Manhattan. She was divorced in 1953.         Mrs. Dooling's brother, T. S. Matthews, who died in January, was the editor of Time magazine from 1949 to 1953, a post he took over from Henry R. Luce, the magazine's creator.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Jackson, and Thomas, of Dillon, Mont.; four daughters, Mary Ann Troedson of Jackson, Janet Bertino of Bozeman, Mont., Catherine, of Stevensville, Mont., and Ellen Draper of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a sister, Margaret Flinsch of White Plains; 23 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Doris Lilly, the author of "How to Marry a Millionaire" and a former newspaper society columnist, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Kurt von Schuschnigg, a friend and the executor of her estate.         Ms. Lilly was a witty participant in the social whirl of charity balls and nightclubs she featured in her books and as a gossip columnist for The New York Post, the McNaught Syndicate and WPIX television in New York. An Inspiration to Capote         "If it were true that money grew on trees, all my friends would be married to apes," she said. She once conceded that her columns were sometimes "silly" and that the people she wrote about were sometimes "shallow." But, she said, "they're pleasant and they smell good and they eat well and drink good wines, and that's all right."         Friends said she was the inspiration for the Holly Golightly character in Truman Capote's book "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         Her own first book, "How to Marry a Millionaire" (Putnam, 1951), became a hit movie starring Marilyn Monroe. Later, doing the updated "How to Marry a Billionaire" (Delacorte, 1984), she said: "A million dollars isn't much money these days. You can't even get a decent house for that."         Ms. Lilly's often provocatively titled books included "How to Make Love in Five Languages" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), "Glamor Girl" (Woodhill, 1977, with Robin Moore as co-author) and "Those Fabulous Greeks: Onassis, Niarchos and Livanos (Cowles, 1970). 'Never Fond of Poverty'         "She was never fond of poverty," wrote Cindy Adams, the New York Post columnist. Remarking on Ms. Lilly's skills in meeting rich people, Ms. Adams wrote that "when the rest of us were in camel's hair," Ms. Lilly received a prized sable coat from a male admirer "who was a little bit married."         Ms. Lilly herself never married anyone, millionaire or otherwise. But she did socialize with the famous and powerful. Even in her youth as a contract actress for Cecil B. DeMille, she had an eye for up and coming people. She dated Ronald Reagan when he was between marriages to Jane Wyman and Nancy Davis.         Three years ago, two letters that Mr. Reagan sent Ms. Lilly were auctioned at Sotheby's to Malcolm Forbes, the publisher, for $4,400. She said that "these letters were written during the period we saw each other, which went on for three years."         Ms. Lilly, who was born in South Pasadena, Calif., attended public schools in Santa Monica. She had a continuing magazine career, working variously as beauty editor of Town and Country and a contributor to McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and, at the time of her death, Avenue.         She was a columnist for The Post from 1968 to 1978, and a commentator for WPIX from 1974 to 1977. She was also a frequent guest on the Merv Griffin Show and television panel shows.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Aline Laveen MacMahon, an actress whose career on the stage, screen, radio and television lasted more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She apparently died from pneumonia, friends said.         A veteran of 43 films, Miss MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in "Dragon Seed" in 1944, appearing as the Chinese mother to the part played by Katharine Hepburn.         A Warner Brothers casting director in 1933 named Miss MacMahon one of the 10 smartest actresses, in a class with Miss Hepburn and Helen Hayes. Miss MacMahon's beauty inspired Cecil Beaton to photograph her and Isamu Noguchi to sculpt a marble bust. 'Beauty and Vitality and Truth'         Raves acclaimed her early role in Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," in 1926. Alexander Woollcott, the critic, said she acted "with extraordinary beauty and vitality and truth." The New Yorker magazine said she "tempted one to rank her immediately as among the Olympians." Noel Coward called the newcomer "astonishing, moving and beautiful."         Rarely did she get a bad notice, even in productions that were otherwise panned. Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times in 1967: "I have been seeing Aline MacMahon for more years than I'm going to be honest enough or ungentlemanly enough to count. Always she has pleased me, sometimes more, sometimes less, nevertheless always."         Offstage, she was equally busy. As chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater in 1950, she organized productions for community theaters. She was active in relief charities.         Miss MacMahon was born in McKeesport, Pa., and moved to Brooklyn with her family. Her father, the late William Marcus MacMahon, was the editor of Munsey's Magazine. At her urging, her mother, Jennie Simon MacMahon, began her own stage career at the age of 53. She died in 1984, three weeks before her 107th birthday.         From Barrymore to Streep         Miss MacMahon graduated from Barnard College in 1920 and made her Broadway debut the next year in "The Mirage." Among her more memorable plays were "Pictures in the Hallway," "Once in a Lifetime," "The Eve of Saint Mark," "The Confidential Clerk" and "All the Way Home."         Her films included "Ah, Wilderness!" with Lionel Barrymore, "Gold Diggers of 1933," "The Search" with Montgomery Clift, "The Eddie Cantor Story," "The Lady Is Willing" with Marlene Dietrich, "The World Changes" with Paul Muni, "Five Star Final" with Edward G. Robinson, "One Way Passage" with William Powell, "Flame and Arrow" with Burt Lancaster, "I Live My Life" with Joan Crawford and "Babbitt."         Her final role, in 1975 with Meryl Streep, was in "Trelawny of the Wells" -- the same play Ms. MacMahon performed in at Barnard 55 years earlier.         She was married to the late Clarence S. Stein, the architect who helped design Sunnyside Gardens in Queens and plan Radburn, N.J. There are no survivors.       
         Marion Letcher Bohmrich, a research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services and with the United States Mission to the United Nations, died on Thursday at Fair Haven Home in Bostic, N.C., where she was a resident. She was 89 years old.         She died of pneumonia and suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, a spokesperson for the home said. She had requested that her remains be made available for research at the Alzheimer's Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C.         Mrs. Bohmrich, a daughter of a Foreign Service officer, traveled and studied in Western Europe, focusing on German culture and tradition. In 1941, she was recruited by the O.S.S., forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, as a social science analyst.         After World War II, she was transferred to the Department of State and sent to the Mission to the United Nations, where she worked with Eleanor Roosevelt when she was chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights from 1946 to 1951.         A native of Turin, Ga., she attended a number of schools in Europe, Mexico and the United States, including Columbia University.         Her first marriage to John Moore McKeehan Woodburn, a writer and editor, ended in divorce. She later married Louis Bohmrich, a Foreign Service officer and lecturer on foreign affairs, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a stepson, Roger Bohmrich of White Plains, and a sister, Adele Letcher Goddard of Sun City, Ariz.       
         Gladys Krieble Delmas, a philanthropist and writer who gave more than $20 million to cultural and educational institutions, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center.         Mrs. Delmas, who was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan, died of heart failure, her lawyer said.         Over more than two decades, she contributed more than $4 million to the New York Public Library. Gifts from Mrs. Delmas, a trustee of the library, allowed it to reopen evenings after the fiscal crisis in the 1970's compelled it to curtail hours. Last spring, a gift of $1 million enabled the library to remain open five days a week instead of four.         Mrs. Delmas was also a significant contributor to the New York City Ballet and to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.         Her fortune was based mainly on the family business started by her father, Vernon K. Krieble. The business, the Loctite Corporation, a manufacturer of glue used in industry, became a multimillion-dollar concern and the Kriebles were sometimes called the Rockefellers of the glue business.         She grew up in Hartford, graduated from Vassar and in 1937, married Jean Paul Delmas. The couple lived in Europe and Latin America for 25 years. During her years abroad, Mrs. Delmas worked as a radio journalist, reporting for French National Radio and Radio Canada. Mr. Delmas died in 1988.         She is survived by her brother, Robert H. Krieble of Old Lyme, Conn.; a niece, Helen K. Fusscas of Marlborough, Conn., and a nephew, Frederick B. Krieble, who lives abroad.       
         Gene Tierney, the elegant actress whose beauty bewitched a tough detective in the 1944 film "Laura" and whose portrayal two years later of a diabolically selfish woman in "Leave Her to Heaven" won her an Academy Award nomination, died Wednesday night at her home in Houston. She was 70 years old.         Miss Tierney died of emphysema, a spokesman for the family said.         Miss Tierney had undergone years of treatment for stress and depression. She retired from films in 1965 after making "The Pleasure Seekers," but made at least two television appearances after that. She told reporters that she preferred her life in Houston as the wife of W. Howard Lee, an oil man whom she married in 1960. He died in 1981. Trying to Cope         A year before her marriage to Mr. Lee, when reporters found her working in a dress shop in Topeka, Kan. (a job she took as part of her psychotherapy at the Menninger Clinic there), she told them she attributed her illness to "my lack of understanding of what I could cope with and what I could not. . . . I tried to work harder and harder, thinking that work would cure everything. All it did was make things worse."         With her blue-green eyes, brown hair, prominent cheekbones and what many young men of the 1940's regarded as the most appealing overbite of the day (Miss Tierney said her movie contract stipulated that her slightly protruding front teeth were never to be fixed) she won plaudits for her patrician look but some criticism for her acting.         Even in "Laura," which more than any other movie established her as a major star, Miss Tierney was faulted by some critics. In that film, a detective (Dana Andrews) falls in love with the portrait of a woman he believes has been murdered. For the first 30 minutes of the film, he and the other characters merely talk about her; then they discover she has not been murdered, and the character appears on screen.         For Thomas P. Pryor, who reviewed the film in The New York Times, Miss Tierney's entrance was a bit of a letdown. She did not "measure up to the word portrait of her character," he wrote.         Nevertheless, Miss Tierney received much praise over the years for the freshness and disarming directness she brought to her portrayal of Laura. The film is still regarded as a classic of its genre.         Among the critics who liked her work was Bosley Crowther, who in 1939 had first seen her perform in the Broadway comedy "Ring Two," by Gladys Hurlburt. She was not yet 20 years old and not long out of finishing school, and she had only a supporting role, but Mr. Crowther wrote in The New York Times that he thought she had talent.         Whatever talent she had she decided not to use on Broadway. She went to Hollywood in 1941, signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox and built her career there. Among her other motion picture credits are "The Return of Frank James" (1940), "Belle Starr" (1941), "The Shanghai Gesture" (1942), "Heaven Can Wait" (1943), "A Bell for Adano" (1945), "Dragonwyck" (1946), "The Razor's Edge" (1946), "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" (1947) and "The Left Hand of God" (1955).         Gene Tierney was born on Nov. 20, 1920, in Brooklyn, to Howard S. Tierney, a successful Manhattan insurance broker, and the former Belle Taylor. Miss Tierney was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; St. Margaret's School in Waterbury, Conn., and at a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. Even with all the propriety that surrounded her upbringing, her grade-school teachers noted that she liked to mimic them, and at St. Margaret's she was regarded as the "class romantic."  Background Showed Through         For some critics who reviewed her films, Miss Tierney could do nothing to obscure her privileged childhood. As early as 1941, when she made "Belle Starr," The Times said: "As for Miss Tierney, her youth and fancy finishing school background betray her. As Belle, she never shot a man, much less loved one."         But by 1946, when she made "Leave Her to Heaven," the actress in Miss Tierney that had been noticed years before by other critics emerged. David Thomson, in "A Biographical Dictionary of Film," said that in "Leave Her to Heaven," Miss Tierney's portrayal of the selfish and deadly character was "frighteningly credible."         In 1941, Miss Tierney eloped with Oleg Cassini, the well-known couturier and her own wardrobe designer. They had a daughter, Daria, in 1943, who was born retarded, a condition attributed to the German measles Miss Tierney contracted during her pregnancy. They had another daughter, Christina, in 1948.         Miss Tierney's marriage to Mr. Cassini ended in divorce. She is survived by their daughters, Daria, who is institutionalized, and Christina Belmont of Paris; four grandchildren, and a sister, Patricia Byrne of Boynton Beach, Fla.       
         Mary Vandergrift, a founder and longtime executive of Parke-Bernet Galleries auction house and for many years a major figure in international auctions, died in her sleep on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         Her daughter, Joan Sweeney of Manhattan, said the cause of death was heart failure.         Ms. Vandergrift was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 4, 1901, and attended college there. Pursuing an interest in art and antiques, she worked for American Art Galleries, later known as American Art Anderson Galleries, a well-known auction house in New York. In 1937, she left American Art with a group of employees that included Hiram H. Parke, Otto Bernet, Leslie A. Hyam and Lewis Marion. Together they formed Parke-Bernet Galleries, which came to dominate New York City's art and antiques auction scene.         Throughout her assocation with the house, Miss Vandergrift oversaw press relations and the design and production of catalogues. When Parke-Bernet was acquired by Sotheby & Company, an English auction house, in 1963, she was named executive vice president of the new firm, Sotheby Parke Bernet. When she retired in 1971, she was succeeded by John Marion, who is now chairman of the firm, which changed its name to Sotheby's Inc. in 1985.         Miss Vandergrift was on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development. Her first husband, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Sr., a career officer in the Army, died in the early 1950's; in 1968 she married E. Swift Newton, an Irish businessman, who died in 1974.         She is survived by her daughter; a sister, Katherine, of Manhattan; her step-son, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Jr., of Orlando, Fla., and three granddaughters.       
         Eleanor Pollock Hughes, former top editor of three national magazines and a public relations executive for several Federal agencies, died Friday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 91 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.         Mrs. Hughes died of heart disease, friends said.         Known professionally as Eleanor Pollock, she was a magazine editor in New York City for nearly three decades, starting in the 1930's. She was the editor in chief of Cue and Family Life, the managing editor of Charm and an assistant to Fleur Cowles in the women's division of Look and Quick magazines at Cowles Publications.         Switching to daily newspapers, she became the editor of the women's section at the Philadelphia Bulletin from the late 1950's to 1965. In that period she was also chairwoman of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award organization. Held Various Federal Posts         Serving in the Government from 1965 to 1973, she variously held the posts of the White House liaison for Project Head Start, public affairs director for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Commission on Product Safety and the National Commission on Materials Policy and press secretary to Betty Furness, when she was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs.         After leaving government employment, Mrs. Hughes did freelance writing and public relations consulting.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Alice Leal Pollock, an actress and playwright, and was educated at the Gardner and Finch Schools.         She was married and divorced from Byron Darnton, a reporter for The New York Times who was the first American correspondent killed while covering World War II. Her second husband, Albion Hughes, also a journalist, is deceased.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Simone Beck, a passionate cook, author and teacher who collaborated with Julia Child on the influential cookbook "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," died yesterday at her home in Placassier, a small village in southern France. She was 87 years old.         Miss Beck, who preferred to be called Simca, had been having heart problems for several months and had stopped eating, said Harold Earle, a cousin. "The doctor said that because she wouldn't eat, she died," he said.         Miss Beck, a champion of regional French cooking, also wrote two cookbooks of her own, "Simca's Cuisine,"' and "New Menus from Simca's Cuisine," both now out of print. Her latest book, "Food and Friends: A Memoir With Recipes," was written with Suzy Patterson and published in August by Viking. 'Changed People's Attitudes'         "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," a two-volume set published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1961 and 1970, was a seminal work in the development of cooking in the United States. "The book changed people's attitudes totally, toward cooking as a real worthwhile pursuit," said Nach Waxman, owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters, a culinary bookshop in New York. Miss Beck, he said, was "an incredibly good home cook" who was never trendy, but never dull.         Miss Beck was born on July 7, 1904, in Tocqueville-en-Caux, near Dieppe in Normandy, into a wealthy family that had made its fortune from the production of Benedictine liqueur. As a child, she learned about cooking from the family cook. She studied cooking in Paris at Cordon Bleu, where she met Julia Child at a cocktail party in 1949.         "We were like sisters," said Mrs. Child, after learning of Miss Beck's death. "We were a pair of cooking nuts. She was a wonderful and generous friend. We called her La Super Francaise, because she was so French: a wonderful teacher, wonderful enthusiasm." In addition to working on books together, the two along with Louisette Bertholle, the third collaborator on the first volume of "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," ran L'Ecole de Trois Gourmandes in Paris.         In 1937, several years after a first marriage ended, Miss Beck married Jean Fischbacher, a chemical engineer who died in 1986.         She is survived by her brother, Bernard Beck, of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence, and five nephews.       
         Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, the secretary of the Democratic National Committee who called the roll and tallied the votes at 12 national conventions from 1944 to 1988, died on Saturday in a hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Bush died of lung cancer, her stepdaughter, Jan Bush Jennings, told The Associated Press.         At each Democratic national convention, from the one that nominated the Roosevelt-Truman ticket to the one that drafted Michael S. Dukakis and Lloyd Bensten, Mrs. Bush called the role of states in a slight, but crisp, Dixie-accented voice that made her a fixture of the convention floor and a legend in the party. 'Born a Democrat'         "I was born a Democrat," she said before the 1976 convention, "like most people were born into religion."         Dorothy McElroy was born on Dec. 8, 1916, in Baldwyn, Miss., the third daughter of a postmaster. When she was in the eighth grade, her family moved to Columbus, Miss., so that she and her sisters could attend Mississippi State College for Women, from which she graduated in 1938.         In 1940, she married Peter Vredenburgh 3d, a wealthy Alabama lumberman and prominent Democrat, and quickly became enmeshed in politics. She was elected national committee woman of the Alabama Young Democrats in 1941 and a vice-president of the Young Democratic Clubs of America in 1943.         She was just 27 years old when she was named secretary to the Democratic National Committee in 1944. She was the first woman -- and the youngest person -- ever to serve in the position, which is unpaid.         Mr. Vredenburgh died in 1956, and in 1962 she married John W. Bush, then a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.         In addition to her work at the conventions, she also arranged meetings of the national and executive committees and kept party records.         She retired in September 1989.         In addition to Mr. Bush and Mrs. Jennings, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Emily Bush Zuckett.       
         Minna Citron, a painter and printmaker best known for her Social Realist images of New York City, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a long illness, said her granddaughter Christiane Citron of Denver.         Mrs. Citron, whose maiden name was Wright, was born in Newark on Oct. 15, 1896, and grew up in Brooklyn. She began to study art as a diversion in the 1920's when she was living in Brooklyn, married and the mother of two sons. By 1928, she was studying at the Art Students League with John Sloan and Kenneth Hayes Miller, whose satirical depictions of city life influenced her own style. She had her first solo exhibition in 1930 at the New School for Social Research.         By 1934, she was divorced and working in a studio on Union Square. She soon became associated with a loosely knit group of Realist painters known as the 14th Street school, who included Moses and Raphael Soyer and Isabel Bishop. In the late 1930's she taught art and painted murals for the Works Progress Administration. In the early 1940's, she changed to abstraction, which remained her primary style for the rest of her life.         Mrs. Citron had many exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad; her most recent show in New York City was held last year at the Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo. Her work is represented in many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, and the National Museum of American Art and the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         She is survived by her sons, Casper, of Manhattan a radio and television commentator, and Tom, of Short Hills., N.J.; seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Sarah Nederlander, the matriarch of the Nederlander theatrical family, died on Dec. 19 at her home in Southfield, Mich. She was 97 years old.         She died of natural causes, said David Techner, funeral director of the Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield.         Mrs. Nederlander, who was born Sarah Applebaum, married David T. Nederlander in 1916. Together they built the Nederlander Organization, which operates a chain of theaters and other entertainment enterprises. Mr. Nederlander died in 1967.         She is survived by a daughter, Frances Kohn, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and five sons: James M. of New York, chairman of the Nederlander Organization; Robert, also of New York, the organization's president; Harry, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Fred, of Franklin, Mich., and Joseph, of Birmingham, Mich.

         Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.
