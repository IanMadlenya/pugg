She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She had talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission, and even before she knew she would be stricken, she was active in AIDS organizations because of the epidemic's toll on colleagues and friends.

         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.

         Wanda Mary Jablonski, an expert on the international oil industry and founder of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly newsletter, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said Edward L. Morse, the newsletter's publisher.         Ms. Jablonski's career began when she landed a big story in 1945 while still an office messenger at the Journal of Commerce in Manhattan. Filling in for the oil reporter and assigned to cover a news conference conducted by a Venezuelan official, she waited until the session ended to corner him for a private interview. In the interview, he disclosed plans to seize and nationalize all foreign oil operations in Venezuela. He also called for joint action by developing countries with oil reserves, an idea that culminated in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960. Savoir-Faire Was Helpful         Ms. Jablonski became the Journal's oil editor and "the most influentual oil journalist of her time," as Daniel Yergin wrote in his history of the oil business, "The Prize" (Simon & Schuster, 1990). He added that she had the "savoir-faire required to get her through all sorts of situations."         Making her way in a male-dominated industry, she befriended Texas wildcatters, Arab sheiks, corporate executives and important government figures around the globe. She traveled often, once spending six months in the desert; on a visit to Saudi Arabia, she found herself housed in the guest quarters of the king's harem.         McGraw-Hill hired her in 1954 as senior editor of its new Petroleum Week, but the magazine folded in 1961. Jobless, she founded her own weekly, which was 8 to 12 pages and printed on yellow paper. It grew steadily to a circulation in the thousands, despite an annual subscription fee in the hundreds of dollars. The current price is $1,375.         Her newsletter became required reading in the industry for information on explorations, refining, supplies, prices and political trends. The readership ranged from Central Intelligence Agency officials to Middle East rulers. Her early reports on oil company plans occasionally enraged executives, who sometimes temporarily canceled their subscriptions in protest. She sold the weekly in 1988 to the Petroleum Intelligence Group. Born in Czechoslovakia         Ms. Jablonski was born in Czechoslovakia. Her mother was a physicist; her father, Eugene, worked for the Socony Oil Company, and the family followed him around the world to England, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Texas, Europe and Morocco.         After settling in the United States in 1938, Ms. Jablonski earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1942 and a master's in journalism from Columbia University in 1943.         In recent years she worked for the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in Manhattan as the director of the National High-Risk Registry for women with a family history of breast cancer. She donated $3 million to the center.         She was married and divorced three times. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.         Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.         She had been in the Navy, as an active-duty officer or a reservist, since World War II, and received a special Presidential appointment to the rank of rear admiral in 1983. In 1982, with the retirement of Adm. Hyman J. Rickover, Admiral Hopper became the oldest officer on active duty in the armed service, which she remained until retiring herself in 1986.         Admiral Hopper made several vital contributions to the development of modern computing systems, including helping invent the Cobol programming language, which is still in widespread use in business.  Award from President         In September, President George Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology "for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users." She was the first woman to receive the award individually.         At the time of her death she was a senior consultant to the Digital Equipment Corporation. She joined Digital in 1986, shortly after her retirement from the Navy.         "Grace took every opportunity to challenge people young and old to consider the infinite possibilities of technology," said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital Equipment's president.         Admiral Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on Dec. 9, 1906, in New York City. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale, she taught math at Vassar College, her alma mater, where she later became an associate professor. She was divorced in 1945 but kept her married name.         In 1949 she worked as a mathematician at the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation. The company was formed by Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in 1946 had developed one of the world's first electronic computers, ENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. Eckert-Mauchly was then building the Univac I, the first commercial electronic computer. The company was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation.         Earlier, in 1943, Dr. Hopper had joined the Navy. As a lieutenant assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, she worked as a programmer on a calculating device called the Mark I, a precursor electronic computers.  Recalled by the Navy         Leaving the Navy in 1946, she remained at Harvard as a faculty member in the computation laboratory. She continued to work on early Navy computers and maintained her Naval career as a reservist. Although retired from the Navy reserve in 1966, then-Commander Hopper was recalled within a year to active duty to oversee a program to standardize the Navy's computer programs and languages.         In 1962, she was elected a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association selected her as its first computer sciences "Man of the Year."         Her work led to the first practical compiler for modern computers. A compiler is a program that translates instructions written by a human programmer into more specific codes that can be directly read by a computer.         Among her many contributions, Admiral Hopper is known for coining the term "bug," which is widely used to refer to mysterious computer failures.         The first bug actually was -- a moth, as Admiral Hopper told the story. It was discovered one August night at Harvard in 1945 inside the Mark I.         "Things were going badly, there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long, glass-enclosed computer," she is quoted as saying. "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth. From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."         Like another Navy figure, Admiral Rickover, Admiral Hopper was known for her combative personality and her unorthodox approach.         A self-described "boat rocker," she once said in a speech that she hoped to live until the year 2000. "I have two reasons," she said. "The first is that the party on Dec. 31, 1999, will be a New Year's Eve party to end all New Year's Eve parties. The second is that I want to point back to the early days of computers and say to all the doubters, 'See? We told you the computer could do all that.' "         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Roger F. Murray II of New Hampshire, and a sister, Mary Murray Westcote of New Jersey.

         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.

         Linda M. Arenth, a nursing executive and innovator in the care of cancer patients, died Feb. 9 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was 59 years old and lived in Baltimore.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Arenth was the vice president of nursing and patient services at Hopkins. Earlier, she was the first director of nursing at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, where she developed the system now used nationally to designate nursing services for different types of cancer patients. She was the first recipient of the national Oncology Nursing Society's award for excellence in the administration of cancer nursing.         She was also on the boards of the Foundation for Nursing of Maryland and Health Care for the Homeless.         Born in Orange, Calif., she grew up in nearby Bellflower. She graduated from Cottey College in Nevada, Mo., in 1952 and earned a nursing degree from the University of Southern California in 1955 and a master's degree from the University of Maryland in 1974.

         Shirley Berman, whose daughter, born with Down Syndrome, inspired her to wage a battle for a New Jersey law requiring doctors to inform parents if their unborn child is retarded, died on Feb. 8 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 55 years old and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Berman, a social worker, began a legal battle after her daughter Sharon, now 17, was born with Down Syndrome. Mrs. Berman contended that her doctor failed to tell her she risked having a retarded child and that the fetus could have been tested for the condition.         In 1979, the New Jersey State Supreme Court ruled that doctors could be sued for "wrongful birth" if their negligence deprived a mother of her right to an abortion and a child was born with defects.         Mrs. Berman worked for the Westchester Association for Retarded Children. A native of Montreal, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree from McGill University in Canada, a master's in art therapy in 1981 from the College of New Rochelle and a master's in social work from Fordham University in 1988.         She is survived by her husband, Paul; two daughters, Sharon, at home, and Deborah, of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Jonathan, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Minnie Segal of Montreal, and two brothers, Bernard and Henry Segal, both of Montreal.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted. Flowers were her favorite subject, roses in particular. She exhibited in galleries and sold dozens of paintings for charity.         The Pickens sisters were born in Macon, Ga., and grew up there and in Atlanta. Their parents taught them to harmonize. Their father, a cotton broker, played the piano and their mother sang.         At first the sisters sang for friends, then at churches and schools. The family moved to Park Avenue in Manhattan in 1932, and a test recording for Victor made such an impression with radio executives that they hired the sisters unseen. Promoted as Three Little Maids From Dixie, they appeared in "Thumbs Up" on Broadway and in a movie, "Sitting Pretty." Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.

         Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn, a leading fashion model in the 1940's and 50's, died Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Huntington L.I.

Horst, George Hoyningen Huene and Irving Penn, whom she married in 1950. In the late 1940's, when most models were paid $10 to $25 an hour, she was earning $40 an hour. When most models's careers ended before their 30th birthdays, hers flourished until she was past 40.         She was a frequent subject of Penn's photographs for Vogue magazine, particularly his studies of French haute couture. Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of Conde Nast Publications, which publishes Vogue, said the Penns represented "an extraordinary relationship between a photographer and a model."         "She was the inspiration and subject of some of Penn's greatest photographs," Mr. Liberman said yesterday. "She epitomized a very noble period of fashion and couture. She gave a classical dignity to anything she wore." 'A Good Clothes Hanger'         Lisa Fonssagrives had a more down-to-earth attitude to her contributions as a model. She was quoted in a 1949 article in Time magazine as saying: "It is always the dress, it is never, never the girl. I'm just a good clothes hanger."         In addition to modeling, she also pursued careers as a ballet dancer, a photographer, a fashion designer and a sculptor.         She was born in Uddevalla, Sweden. Her father, a dentist who also painted, changed the family name from Anderson, which he considered too commonplace, to Bernstone. Her mother made clothes and encouraged Lisa to study art and ballet.         Lisa Bernstone went to Paris to pursue a dancing career. She met and married Fernand Fonssagrives, a dancer, there in 1935. Photographs Led to Modeling         A year later, Horst took some photographs of her that led to a modeling career. Pictures of her appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1939, she worked both as a model and as a photographer.         She continued both careers after her divorce and subsequent marriage to Penn. After she stopped modeling in the mid-50's, she designed clothes for about six years, at one point doing a collection of leisure wear for Lord & Taylor.         In the 1960's, she devoted her time to sculpturing, working in marble, bronze and fiberglass. She was represented by the Marlborough Gallery.         A book on her work as a model is scheduled for publication later this year in Germany.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer, and a son, Tom Penn, a metal designer, both of New York City; by two sisters, Lilian Bernstone and Kajsa Lundquist, both of Sweden, and by two grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Man Sarcka, a founder of Spring Lake Ranch in Vermont, one of the earliest halfway houses for the mentally ill, died on Sunday at Hampshire House, a community care home in East Montpelier, Vt. She was 98 years old and lived much of her life in Long Island City and Richmond Hill, Queens.         She died of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Sarcka and her husband, Wayne, established Spring Lake Ranch at Cuttingsville, Vt., in 1932 for people with mental and emotional problems and ran it for 30 years. Their therapeutic approach, based on the participation of both staff members and residents in ranch affairs, attracted national attention.         Retiring to the island of Jamaica in 1961, the Sarckas organized a school for adults in the mountain community of Malvern. After her husband's death in 1969, Mrs. Sarcka returned to Queens.         Active in volunteer work at the United Nations, Mrs. Sarcka was president of the Queens Chapter of the United Nations Association from 1975 to 1979. She also served as executive secretary of the League of Nations Association of Greater New York from 1927 to 1928.         A graduate of Barnard College, she was honored with the distinguished alumna award in 1983 and the Barnard Medal of Distinction in 1985.         Born in New York City, she came from a prominent New York family. Her father, Alrick H. Man, a Wall Street lawyer, developed the community of Kew Gardens in Queens, on property that had been bought by her grandfather, Alban P. Man.         She is survived by her daughter, Anne of Montpelier, Vt.; a niece, Lucy Jinishian of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a nephew, Alrick Man 3d of South Londonderry, Vt.       
         Rose Korn Hirschman, a real-estate lawyer and volunteer at the United Nations and other organizations, died Jan. 24 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver failure, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up there and in Brooklyn. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at New York University. She began practicing law in Manhattan with her brother, Ashton Korn, and after his death worked on her own.         For nine years she represented the International Federation of Women Lawyers at United Nations commissions dealing with discrimination, minorities, women, economics, crime, commodities trade, human rights and population growth.         She was a past president of the Sisterhood of the Community Synagogue, vice president of the Congregation Emanuel Sisterhood and chairwoman of its youth activities and board member of the Young Women's Hebrew Association. She headed the Mount Vernon branch of the American Red Cross and served on the board of its Westchester County chapter. She was also on the boards of the Mount Vernon Nursing School and Mount Vernon Hospital and founded the hospital's volunteer services.         Her husband, Dr. Sol Hirschman, is dead. She is survived by two daughters, Judge Aileen Hirschman Belford of Fall River, Mass., and E. Judith Hirschman Berger of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Richard James Hirschman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Shirley Ullman Wedeen, a Brooklyn College educator and past chairwoman of the City University's Faculty Senate, died on Thursday at home in Brooklyn.         She was 65 years old and died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Wedeen taught education courses at Brooklyn College since 1948 and was also assistant dean of students from 1966 to 1968.         Her academic specialty was reading skills. She created the first remedial reading program in the City University system and ran it from 1961 to 1964. She also wrote two books, "College Remedial Reader" (Putnam, 1958) and "Advanced College Reader (Putnam, 1963).         She was elected chairwoman of the Faculty Senate for the entire City University from 1986 to 1990, and in that post sat as an ex-officio member on the university's Board of Trustees. She had also served as the Senate's vice chairwoman for four years and its Governance Committee chairwoman for two years.         Dr. Wedeen graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946. At New York University she earned a master's degree in guidance counseling in 1947 and a doctorate in psychology in 1951.         Surviving are her husband, Dr. Peter Wedeen; two sons, Dr. Van Wedeen of Boston, and Dr. Glenn Wedeen of Manhattan, and her father, Hugo Ullman of Brooklyn.       
         Elinor White Montgomery, until recently the board chairwoman of the New York City School Volunteer Program, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Montgomery's volunteer work also included her serving as a trustee of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and the Thacher School in Ojai, Calif. She also served on committees of the Environmental Defense Fund.         The school volunteer program includes a reading project in which hundreds of New Yorkers, including celebrities like Mike Wallace and Christopher Reeve, read aloud to third graders to help spur their interest in reading.         She was born in Oyster Bay, L.I. She graduated from Smith College and for several years taught at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, George C., an investment banker; a daughter, Diana, of Manhattan; two sons, George, of Riverside, Conn., and Jonathan, of Manhattan; a sister, Sheila English of New Haven; a brother, Alexander White of Manhattan and Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Cecile Ruth Sands, who served for six years as the only woman on New York City's Board of Education and also worked for charitable causes, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         After her surprise appointment in 1955 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Mrs. Sands immediately became a pivotal member of the board and took controversial stands against McCarthyism and for integration.         In her first year on the board she was the sole dissenter against a measure to force school workers to inform on employees who had been Communists. Her view was vindicated when four teachers, who renounced the party but refused to inform on others, appealed to the State Education Commissioner. He overruled the board, saying, "This type of inquisition has no place in the school system."         In a 1957 talk to the Central Synagogue in Manhattan, she called for school integration to overcome the effects of racial separation in neighborhood housing patterns.         For 60 years she was on the board of the Hebrew Education Society, which ran a settlement house in Brooklyn, and was its first female president. She was an officer in the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Jewish Welfare Board.         Her husband of 36 years, Dr. Irving J. Sands, a neurologist and psychiatrist, is deceased. She is survived by two sons, Dr. William L. of Albany, N.Y., and Dr. Richard H. of Westport, Conn.; seven grandchildren; five great grandchildren, and a brother, Dr. Eugene A. Humbert of Atlantis, Fla.       
         Catherine Wolkonsky, a French and Russian teacher for 50 years and founding chairman of the Slavic Department at the State University of New York at Albany, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 96 years old and lived in Spring Valley, N.Y.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Born into a landowning family in St. Petersburg, she came to the United States in 1924. She taught French in Cooperstown, N.Y., until World War II, when Cornell University started training Army officers in Russian. She became the only woman on the faculty then. She was chairman and professor of Russian at Vassar College from 1946 to 1961, after which she led the Slavic Department at SUNY, Albany, until 1972.         Mrs. Wolkonsky continued to teach at the Russian Summer School at Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., until 1985, when she was 90 years old.         She is survived by her daughter, Maria Marr, of Spring Valley, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Lucy M. Lewis, a leading American Indian potter, died on March 12 in the hospital of the pueblo where she lived, in Acoma, N.M. Her birth date was never recorded, but she was believed to be 93 years old, her family said.         She died after a long illness, said her daughter, Emma Lewis Mitchell.         Miss Lewis's works have been exhibited in museums and embassies around the world, and are included in collections at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Museum of the American Indian in New York.         She grew up in the Acoma pueblo, a Pueblo Indian community and the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in North America. Miss Lewis, who was a self-taught artist, won many awards, including the New Mexico Governor's Award in 1983.         She was also a teacher and traveled around the country giving workshops in ceramics. A biography, "Lucy M. Lewis, American Indian Potter," by Susan Peterson, was published by Kodansha International in 1984.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by 2 sons, 6 other daughters, 45 grandchildren, 46 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-grandchildren.       
         M. Jean Herman, a brownstone holdout around whom a 31-story office tower was built opposite Bloomingdale's, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         A graduate of Barnard College, Miss Herman worked as a market researcher and later became a freelance public relations specialist.         She was a fourth-floor tenant of 134 East 60th Street when a developer assembled a blocklong site on Lexington Avenue. Other residents of her building and neighboring buildings relocated but she refused to move.         Her apartment was rent-stabilized and she lived in it for more than 30 years, in the middle of Manhattan's choice shopping district. By 1986, she was the sole occupant of 134, sharing the address solely with the builder.  Miss Herman is survived by a brother, Harold Herman of Brooklyn.       
         Nancy Walker, who played Rhoda's mother, McMillan and wife's housekeeper and a paper-towel-promoting waitress in television commercials, along with a string of brassy, loudmouthed cutups on Broadway, died yesterday at her home in Studio City, Calif. She was 69 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Frank Liberman, a family spokesman.         A long-faced, red-haired, petite actress, Miss Walker said she was never able to play what she called a "gray character."         "I don't understand it myself," she said in 1976, "but I have this effect on people, so when I walk onstage, they start laughing."         That is pretty much what happened when through a case of mistaken identity she got her big break on Broadway at age 19. Her father, who was an acrobat, asked his agent to send her to see the producer George Abbott, who was auditioning actors for a new comedy, "Best Foot Forward."  Genesis of a Comedian         She was introduced as Miss Walker -- Mr. Abbott and Richard Rodgers had been expecting a singer named Helen Walker -- and began belting out a song called "Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four." Mr. Abbott built up the "blind date" role in "Best Foot Forward" from five lines to a leading role, making her an instant success.         She knew from age 10, she said, that she wanted to be a performer. But she said she did not realize that she could be a comedian until she started getting laughs in "Best Foot Forward."         "After that," she said, "people just kept writing parts for me."         But she said it was not a case of art imitating life. "Not so talkative" was how she once compared herself with the chatty characters she played onstage and on television.         "I've always thought people who are on, offstage, save very little for onstage," she said in 1976. "You can't keep the mask on all the time: it flakes."         Miss Walker, whose name originally was Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born on May 10, 1922, in Philadelphia. Her father changed his name to Dewey Barto when he joined a vaudeville act called the Three Bartos. When Miss Walker was 3 weeks old, her mother went back on the vaudeville circuit herself, and Miss Walker slept backstage. She crawled out into the spotlight one night when she was 10 months old and stole the show.         After her success in "Best Foot Forward," M-G-M flew her to Hollywood and signed her to a seven-year contract. She appeared in the movie version of the play and in "Girl Crazy" and "Broadway Rhythm," playing variations of the blind-date character she had mastered on Broadway. She also appeared in "Lucky Me," which starred Doris Day and Robert Cummings.         On Broadway, she also starred as the jaded cabdriver Brunnhilde Esterhazy in "On the Town" in 1944 and later appeared in "Pal Joey," "Wonderful Town," "Look, Ma, I'm Dancin"' and "Do, Re, Mi," a spoof of the jukebox industry in which she played Phil Silvers's long-suffering wife. 'The Quicker Picker-Upper'         She was also the face that launched a million rolls of paper towels in television commercials beginning in the 1970's, saying: "Bounty. It's the quicker picker-upper."         She was not defensive about making commercials. "One minute's work done well is just as important as one hour," she said. "Look, if it were a bad minute, I'd feel terrible, because I get paid very well, and that would be cheating. I'm not cheating anybody. I mean, an artist is an artist no matter what he does. Besides, if I weren't doing those commercials well, I'd not have gotten on the Mary Tyler Moore show."         On "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," she played Rhoda Morgenstern's overbearing mother, and went on to a regular role when Valerie Harper, as Rhoda, got a series of her own. In 1974, when Rhoda was finally married after a long run as Miss Moore's unmarried best friend, all Rhoda and Joe wanted was a small ceremony before a justice of the peace. But as Rhoda's mother, Ida Morgenstern, Miss Walker was determined to have a slightly more elaborate ceremony in her Bronx apartment. Rhoda wanted no more than a dozen guests. Ida invited 79.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig, and their daughter, Miranda Craig who lives in Los Angeles.

Stealing a Show         Miss Walker, whose name was originally Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born on May 10, 1922, in Philadelphia.

The show "Rhoda" ended in 1978, after a five-year run. Miss Walker also appeared in the series "McMillan and Wife" from 1971 to 1976, playing a sassy housekeeper. She was also the host of "The Nancy Walker Show," which had a brief run in 1976.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig; a daughter, Miranda Craig, and a sister, Betty Lou Barto, both of Los Angeles.       
         Naome Lewis, a longtime magazine editor, died on March 18 at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         She died of bone marrow cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis began working at Trains magazine in Milwaukee before World War II. In the mid-1940's she joined McFadden Publishing in Manhattan as an articles editor at True Detective. Several years later she became an associate fiction editor at Collier's.         In 1958 she joined Good Houskeeping, where she was the fiction editor from 1960 until her retirement in 1989. At the magazines, she condensed and adapted numerous best-selling novels, including works by Erich Marie Remarque, Jessamyn West, Arthur Hailey, Pearl S. Buck, Daphne du Maurier and Virginia Holt.         Mrs. Lewis, who was born in Deerfield, Wis., was drawn to editing by her fondness for reading.         Surviving are her husband of 30 years, Robert E. Lewis, a literary agent; two daughters, Ellen J. and Sarah E., both of Manhattan; a brother, James Simonson of Minneapolis, , and a sister, Sonja Schrag of La Crosse, Wis.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M. Ourisman of Bethesda, Md., and Robert B. Ourisman of Washington; her mother, Hannah Haydnet of Minneapolis; a sister, Patricia Chanin of New York City, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Mary Osborne, one of the few women to gain jazz stardom as a guitarist and the first woman to play the electric guitar professionally, died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70 years old.         She died of liver failure as a result of cancer, said her son Ralph Scaffidi Jr.         Both her parents were guitarists, and Ms. Osborne -- whose family name was Orsborn -- became fascinated by stringed instruments as a child. She began playing the ukulele when she was 4 and at 10 she joined a string band led by her father in which she played banjo. She had started playing guitar a year earlier, and while she was in grammar school she was playing jazz violin. 'The Most Startling Thing'         She sang and played guitar in her hometown, Bismarck, N.D., in her teen-age years. When she was 17 some fellow musicians urged her to hear the Al Trent Sextet, which was playing a one-night stand in Bismark. One musician played an instrument she had never seen or heard before: an electric guitar. The guitarist was Charlie Christian.         "The only electric guitar I knew of was the Hawaiian guitar," she said. "I'd listen to all the jazz guitarists of the time, but they all played acoustic. But here was Charlie Christian playing Django Reinhardt's 'St. Louis Blues' note for note but with an electric guitar. It was the most startling thing I'd ever heard."         The next day, she found a guitar like Christian's. It cost $85; for $45, a friend built an amplifier for her. From then on, she was an electric guitarist.         She went on the road with an all-female trio. When they played St. Louis, Buddy Rogers, the movie star-turned-band leader, heard them and added them to his band. The Rogers band broke up when it reached New York, but Ms. Osborne quickly got jobs at radio stations and recording studios and joined in jam sessions in clubs on West 52d Street. She eventually formed her own trio.         With her husband, Ralph Scaffidi, a trumpet player, she moved to Bakersfield in 1968 where they formed and ran the Osborne Guitar Company, which later became the Osborne Sound Laboratories, a manufacturer of amplifiers and public-address systems. She appeared at the Kool Jazz Festival in New York in 1981 and played at the Village Vanguard two years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Bakersfield, she is survived by her husband, another son, Peter, of Clovis, N.M.; a daughter, Susan Chidgey of Bakersfield; a brother, Elvy Orsborn, and a sister, Louise Orsborn.       
         Kathryn Beliveau Feuer, a scholar of Russian literature who ruffled the Soviet authorities by befriending dissident intellectuals during the cold war, died Sunday at The Cedars rehabilitation center in Charlottesville, Va. She was 65 years old and lived in Charlottesville, where she was a professor at the University of Virginia.         She died of complications after hip surgery, her family said.         Dr. Feuer published a novel at the age of 21 and, during a long career as an educator, headed the Slavic languages departments at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Toronto.         During a research visit to Russia in 1963, she brought in miniature copies of "Doctor Zhivago" and secretly passed out the contraband to dissidents. She also arranged for the manuscript of Anna Akhmatova's "The Requiem," a lengthy anti-Stalin poem, to be smuggled out of Russia, thus enabling its publication in the West.         Toward the end of Dr. Feuer's trip, she and her daughter were roughed up by Soviet agents in a sleeper compartment on a train, she later told American officials.         On another day, the police in Leningrad searched Dr. Feuer's possessions and demanded that she sign confessions of having met with dissidents. But having already memorized and destroyed her notes on those meetings, she admitted nothing and was let go.         Dr. Feuer helped Eastern European exiles settle in the West, bringing Czeslaw Milosz, the Polish poet and later a Nobel laureate, to Berkeley and Josef Skvorecky, an award-winning Czechoslovak novelist, to Toronto.         Dr. Feuer was born in Brooklyn and grew up mostly in Nutley, N.J. In 1946, she graduated from Vassar College, where she was the editor of the literary magazine. At the age of 21 she won Mademoiselle magazine's 1947 fiction award for a short story, and soon afterward Doubleday published her only novel, "Strike for the Heart," about a young woman's soul-searching.         She earned a master's degree at Columbia University in 1954 and a doctorate there in 1965 with a thesis based on research of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" manuscripts at his estate in Russia, where she stayed in 1963. That trip was her second to the country; in 1955 she was one of the first American exchange visitors permitted in the cold-war era.         Surviving are her husband, Lewis Feuer, a noted sociologist, philosopher, and social critic; a daughter, Robin F. Miller of Newton, Mass., a professor of Russian literature at Brandeis University, and three granddaughters.       
         Amy Ogden Welcher, a founder and first national president of Church Women United, a national ecumenical organization, died on Feb. 21 at her home at Avery Heights in Hartford. She was 104 years old.         She died of heart failure, a family member said.         In 1941, several women's church groups formed what was then called the United Council of Church Women and named Miss Welcher as president. Under her leadership, the organization became a strong advocate for peace and national unity, fighting against religious, racial and political bigotry.         She was an active member of the Congregational Church's Foreign Mission Board for more than 60 years and was involved in organizational work, visiting missions in China, Japan, India and Lebanon.

         Harriet Mandelbaum, who spent decades of her life working in behalf of autistic and other mentally impaired children, died on Thursday at Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 79 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Her family said a cerebral hemorrhage caused her death.         She was active both in her community and on the national level. A member of the United States Joint Commission on Mental Health for Children, she toured the country to speak about the special needs of such children. In 1951, she helped found the League for Emotionally Disturbed Children, which was dedicated to promoting educational and therapeutic facilities.         The league became the National Organization for Mentally Ill Children in 1955, and Mrs. Mandelbaum was its first president. For many years, she was involved in the growth of the League Treatment Center, for both children and adults, in Brooklyn, and of the League School. She was the first head of the school's board after it was founded in 1953.         Mrs. Mandelbaum is survived by her husband, Dr. Joseph Mandelbaum, himself a past president of the League School; two sons, Paul Mandelbaum, of Brooklyn, and Dr. Joel Mandelbaum, of Kingston, N.Y.; a daughter, Jo Travis, of Branchville, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Margaret T. Barker, an actress and director who was an original member of the Group Theater, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had homes in New York City and Fairfield, Conn.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Miss Barker was born in Baltimore, where her father was a prominent doctor. She attended Bryn Mawr College, where a fellow actor in student productions was Katharine Hepburn, and began her career in 1928 as the flirtatious Alice Fordyce in the Broadway production of "The Age of Innocence," which starred Katharine Cornell. Three years later, she appeared as Henrietta in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" with Miss Cornell. She left that production to join the Group Theater, taking major roles in "The House of Connelly," "Men in White" and Clifford Odets's "Till the Day I Die." In 1937, when the Group Theater split into warring factions, she was dismissed.         In addition to many Broadway appearances in the 1940's and 50's, including roles in the original productions of Lillian Hellman's "Autumn Garden" and Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding," she performed with the Williamstown Summer Theater in Massachusetts for 10 years and was a member of the Circle Repertory Company in New York. She also directed, produced and performed in Off Broadway plays, regional theaters, television and film.         Her companion was Ann Macfarlane.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Nika Hazelton, whose cookbooks have been a mainstay of serious cooks for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of natural causes after a lingering illness, said her son, Dr. S. A. Standen, who lives in London.         Mrs. Hazelton, the daughter of a German diplomat, was born in Rome, attended school there, and studied at the London School of Economics. She began her career as a reporter in 1930, covering the League of Nations for the German Press Association and then moving on to freelance work.         After marrying and emigrating to the United States in 1940, she began writing cookbooks with recipes culled primarily from home cooks throughout Europe and South America.         She published 30 books and they reflected her firm, no-nonsense taste in food. "American Home Cooking" (Bobbs Merrill, 1967), "French Home Cooking" (Viking Penguin, 1979,) "International Cookbook" (Harper & Row, 1967) and "The Italian Cookbook (Henry Holt, 1979) remain standards.         She was also a frequent contributer to the major food magazines and for several decades wrote a column about food, wine and travel for The National Review.         As cooking became trendy and precious in the United States, she seemed to raise a speculative eyebrow. Facing a group of wine writers in New York several years ago, Mrs. Hazelton waved aside questions about white truffles and little-known family vineyards. "I'm here to show you a meal from Tuscany that has the virtue of not being too expensive and not taking much genius or fuss to prepare," she informed her audience and proceeded to demonstrate the proper way to make escarole and rice soup.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1954. She married Harold Hazelton in 1956. He died in November.         Mrs. Hazelton is survived by two sons, Dr. Standen and J. O. Standen, a lawyer in San Francisco, and three grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on April 28 at St. Agnes Church on East 43d Street in Manhattan.         Correction:  April 18, 1992, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about the cookbook author Nika Hazelton misstated the day of her death and the date of a memorial service. She died on Wednesday, and the service will be on April 27, at 3 P.M., at the Church of St. Agnes, 141 East 43d Street, in Manhattan.       
         Miriam Borgenicht Klein, the author of 17 suspense novels under the name of Miriam Borgenicht, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76 years old.         She died of lymphoma, her family said.         Mrs. Klein graduated from Barnard College in 1936 and worked for the Works Progress Administration during the Depression.         Mrs. Klein's first mystery, "Corpse in Diplomacy," was published in 1949, and her most recent, "No Duress," came out in 1991. She completed her last, yet unpublished, by dictating the conclusion to a daughter from her hospital bed.         She is survived by her husband, Milton; three daughters, Elizabeth Hersh, of Washington; Emily Abel, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Margaret Nelson of Middlebury, Vt.; two sons, James, of Takoma Park, Md., and Thomas, of New York; a sister, Joan Aron, of Washington, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Sara Chisholm Farrington, a writer and a pioneer in international big-game fishing, died Thursday at Southhampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 84 years old.         She died of pneumonia after suffering a stroke, her family said.         Brought up in Manhattan and Long Island, she went to the Spence and Farmington schools. In 1934, she married a noted outdoorsman and author, Selwyn Kip Farrington Jr.         Mrs. Farrington, under the pen name of Chisie Farrington and as an internationally known angler with seven world records to her credit, wrote "Women Can Fish" in 1951. The book chronicled her experiences accompanying her husband on fishing trips around the world. "Women Can Fish," as well as the fishing articles she wrote in the 1930's and 40's for Harpers Bazaar, Vogue and Mademoiselle, helped to establish women as sporting participants in their own right.         The Farringtons traveled in a circle of big-game adventurers who included Ernest Hemingway and Alfred Glassell. In their company, Sara Farrington was an angler among equals: The 674-pound tuna she caught off Watch Hill, R.I., in the mid-1950's was first tuna that had ever been caught in those fishing grounds by man or woman.         She is survived by a grandniece, Patricia McCain, and a grandnephew, Charles Madeira.       
         Han Schroeder, an architect, interior designer and educator, died on March 20 in the Boerhaave Clinic in Amsterdam. She was 73 years old and lived in Richmond.         She died after a short illness, said Janet De Cecilia, the coordinator of the interior design program at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I., where Ms. Schroeder had taught.         Ms. Schroeder was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Her family lived in Schroeder House, a landmark De Stilj house designed in 1924 by the architect Gerrit Rietveld, with whom Ms. Schroeder later worked, in collaboration with her mother, Truss Schroeder-Schraeder, an interior designer. From 1972 to 1987, Ms. Schroeder was the consulting architect for the restoration of the house, now a museum. Two of her drawings for the restoration are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Before immigrating to the United States in the early 1960's, she had her own architecture and interior design office in Amsterdam. In 1964 she settled on Long Island to teach interior design at Adelphi University and the Parsons School of Design, and three years later she was appointed professor at the New York Institute of Technology. In 1981 she moved to Richmond, where she taught at Virginia Commonwealth University until retiring as professor emerita in 1988. She was one of the first women to have their work represented in the archives of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va.         She is survived by a brother, Binnert, of the Hague.

Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A native of Fort Worth, Mrs. Macfadden had a first career as an interior designer. In 1948, she became the third wife of Bernarr Macfadden, the physical culturist and publisher who died in 1955 at the age of 87.         She was a regular monthly contributor to her husband's publications, "Physical Culture" and "Health Review," lectured on fitness, appeared on television talk shows, developed her own line of creams and lotions, and maintained a counseling service on mental and physical health in her apartment until the time of her death.

She was 95 years old and had previously lived in Charlottesville, Va., and, until 1956, in Chicago.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         A native of Wilmette, Ill., she graduated from the University of Minnesota, which cited her for its Outstanding Achievement Award 50 years after she received a master's degree there.

Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining.

         Elizabeth David, a food writer credited with almost single-handedly changing the cooking in her native England, died on Friday at her home in London. She was 78 years old.         She died of a stroke, British press reports said.         Alice Waters, who is often described as the mother of modern American cooking, said Mrs. David was her greatest inspiration. "When I go back and read her book now," Ms. Waters said, "I feel I plagiarized them. All of it seeped in so much, it's embarrassing to read them now."         Grand dame of the kitchen, doyenne of modern cookery, expert on Mediterranean cookery, Mrs. David first displayed her importance with the publication of "A Book of Mediterranean Food," in 1950. The ration-weary English could barely buy enough to eat but they were enchanted by her descriptions of meals that included eggs, butter, seafood, tomatoes, olives, apricots, ingredients that were difficult, or impossible, to obtain. Foods that are taken for granted today in England -- garlic, olive oil, Parmigiano Reggiano -- were unknown and generally viewed with suspicion before Mrs. David.  Renown Spreads in Britain         The following year "French Country Cooking" was published, followed in 1954 by "Italian Food," "Summer Cooking," in 1955 and "French Provincial Cooking" in 1960. Articles in Vogue, House & Garden, The Sunday Times and The Spectator helped to spread her influence throughout a country whose culinary renown has been generally confined to fish and chips and spotted Dick.         Her evocative writings drew her fans to undiscovered but enticing worlds.         "In other markets, on other shores, the unfamiliar fishes may be vivid, mysterious, repellant, fascinating and bright with splendid color," she wrote in "Italian Food." "Only in Venice do they look good enough to eat. In Venice even ordinary sole and ugly great skate are striped with delicate lilac lights, the sardines shine like newly minted silver coins, pink Venetian scampi are fat and fresh, infinitely enticing in the early dawn."         But Mrs. David's books were always about more than just food. "Her esthetic is about simplicity and a kind of fragrance," Ms. Waters said. "She had a great sense of the seasons and always about life around the table -- the setting, the conversation. It was always more than just the food because her recipes were not very specific, to say the least. I remember being frustrated, but it made you think.         "She was saying something pretty profound about the recipe process -- that food changes all the time. It's never, never the same. The climate, the location, all made a difference." White Truffles at Olney's         Richard Olney, an American food and wine writer who lives in France, met Mrs. David in the early 1970's when he was living in London. Mr. Olney, whose book, "Simple French Food," (reprinted by Macmillan in 1992) also had a remarkable impact on American cooking, said Mrs. David's writing style, the lack of specificity in her recipes, did not appeal to American publishers, and delayed her fame in this country.         In 1979, he introduced Mrs. David to Ms. Waters, who, 10 years before, had hung around her shop just to get a glimpse of her but never had the courage to introduce herself. The three of them had a six-hour white truffle lunch at Mr. Olney's apartment. "I bought a huge jar of white truffles from Italy," recalled Ms. Waters. "There must have been five the size of golf balls. We shaved them over the top of sausages. We shaved them over equal parts of Parmesan cheese. We had them over pasta, with an omelet, with olive oil and toast. It was a truffle extravaganza."         Eventually some of Mrs. David's friends persuaded her to visit the United States, a country about which she was "a little bit snobbish," said Mr. Olney. "She was treated like a star and she adored it, but she would never admit it."         Born to the English upper class, her studies at the Sorbonne forever altered her destiny. She lived with a Parisian family that she later described as "both exceptionally greedy and exceptionally well-fed." She forgot what she had learned at the university and tried, instead, to recreate the food to which she had been exposed.         When she returned to England she worked briefly as an actress, then as a sales clerk for Worth. Her brief marriage in 1944 to Anthony David, a British Army officer, was childless.         In 1965, she opened a kitchen shop that bore her name and in 1970 published "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen." Three years later she severed her connections with the shop after a falling out with her partners. Her last cook book, "English Bread and Yeast Cookery," appeared in 1973. Unlike her earlier books it was more for reference than reading. Her last book, "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine," a collection of earlier writings, was published in 1984.         "She had an appreciation of all that was simple and fresh," said Mr. Olney. "There was a complete lack of interest in anything pretentious. She was wonderfully, wickedly witty. She made fun of everything, but she was never cruel."         There were no immediate survivors.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Dr. Beth Anspach Bernstein, a psychoanalyst for children, died on May 8 at her home in Manhattan. She was 76 years old and died of breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Bernstein had a longtime private practice in Manhattan until she retired a year ago because of illness.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Manhattan. After graduating from Hunter College, she earned a master's degree in English at Yale. Turning to psychology, she earned a master's degree at New York University and a doctorate from the University of California.         Her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Benedict J. Bernstein, also a psychoanalyst, died last year.         She is survived by a daughter, Carola Chase of the Bronx; two sons, Jonathan of Manhattan and Michael of Chicago; a sister, Jean Farr of British Columbia, Canada, and five grandchildren.       
         Lavinia Faxon Russ, who took up writing at the age of 57 and published eight books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Russ died of pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Russ was a buyer of children's books for a Scribner's bookstore when she decided to try writing. Her works included "A Young Explorer's New York" (New York Graphic Society, 1962), "Over the Hills and Far Away" (Harcourt, Brace, 1968), "The April Age" (Atheneum, 1975) and "Alec's Sandcastle" (Harper and Row, 1972). Among her books for adults was "The Girl on the Floor Will Help You" (Doubleday, 1969).         She also lectured, wrote book reviews, was the host of a children's television show for a year, evaluated manuscripts for publishers and was the juvenile editor of Publisher's Weekly.         Her two marriages, to Carroll Dunne and Hugh Russ, ended in divorce. Her survivors include a son, Martin Russ of Oakville, Calif.; two daughters, S. K. Dunne of Rutherford, Calif., and Maggie Geiger Turner of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Mary Ann Spencer Pulaski, a retired children's psychologist, lecturer and author, died on Saturday at Glen Cove Hospital on Long Island. She was 75 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         Her family said she died after a long illness.         Dr. Pulaski graduated from Wellesley College in 1938 and earned a Ph.D. in child psychology at City University of New York three decades later. In between, she worked in merchandising and advertising and as an editorial assistant at Glamour magazine.         While her children were in school, she earned master's degrees in education and school psychology and taught at the Buckley Country Day School in Roslyn, L.I. From 1967 until her retirement in 1979, she served as a psychologist in the Herricks public school system in New Hyde Park, L.I.         Dr. Pulaski was the author of many articles, including "Understanding Piaget." A revised edition of it was published by Harper & Row Publishers Inc. in 1980. She lectured widely and taught at Hofstra University, Adelphi University and Queens College of the City University of New York.         Dr. Pulaski is survived by her husband of 52 years, Charles A. Pulaski; a son, Charles A. Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.; a daughter, Elizabeth Mertens of Glen Head, L.I., and three grandchildren.       
         Margaret Frankel Bornstein, a longtime leader in Jewish organizations, died on Monday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. She was 73 years old and lived in Fair Lawn, N.J.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         With her husband, Julian, Mrs. Bornstein lent support to many civic and educational centers in Fair Lawn. She was the first female president of that borough's Jewish center.         Mrs. Bornstein served as president of 14 community organizations in Fair Lawn.         In addition to her husband, who is the retired president of Jacquard Fabrics in Paterson, N.J., Mrs. Bornstein is survived by three sons, Frederic, of Buffalo Grove, Ill., Andrew, of Washington, and Steven, of Westport, Conn.; a daughter, Faye Moore of Atlanta, and eight grandchildren.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Jacqueline Smith, a television producer who led ABC Entertainment's daytime programming to six consecutive years of top ratings from 1978 through 1983, died on June 3 at her home. She was 59 years old and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Smith had also worked at CBS and NBC, where she oversaw daytime programming until last year. She was known in the industry for creating concepts in story development and production quality and for furthering the talents of actors and casting directors. Awards for Children's Programming         Ms. Smith was a native of Philadelphia, and attended Antioch College before starting her broadcasting career as a writer and producer at KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco. She received three Peabody Awards for children's programming there.         In 1963, the CBS network put her in charge of all its children's programming. She later became the director of special programs for the network in Hollywood, overseeing variety specials, award shows and dramatic specials.         Ms. Smith joined ABC in 1977 and, as a vice president, was responsible for the production, writing and performances on its daytime serials "All My Children," "Ryan's Hope," "One Life to Live" and "General Hospital." She enlisted guest appearances by many celebrities, Elizabeth Taylor among them, and wove aspects of adventure, fantasy, comedy and science-fiction into the accustomed fare of romance and family crises.         She stepped down in 1987, remained as a consultant for another year, and then formed her own company, Pygmalion Productions. She returned to the network wars to take charge of daytime programming for NBC Entertainment for two years until 1991.         Ms. Smith's companion was Ed Fisher, the cartoonist.         She is survived by her mother, Gertrude Feldenkreis of Atlantic City; a daughter, Eleanor Smith, and a son, David A., both of Santa Monica; a sister, Nancy Wurman of Philadelphia, and a brother, Howard Feldenkreis of Leominster, Mass.       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Margaret Frankel Bornstein, a longtime leader in Jewish organizations, died on Monday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. She was 73 years old and lived in Fair Lawn, N.J.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         With her husband, Julian, Mrs. Bornstein lent support to many civic and educational centers in Fair Lawn. She was the first female president of that borough's Jewish center.         Mrs. Bornstein served as president of 14 community organizations in Fair Lawn.         In addition to her husband, who is the retired president of Jacquard Fabrics in Paterson, N.J., Mrs. Bornstein is survived by three sons, Frederic, of Buffalo Grove, Ill., Andrew, of Washington, and Steven, of Westport, Conn.; a daughter, Faye Moore of Atlanta, and eight grandchildren.       
         Geraldine Delaney Harris, a dancer and singer who appeared in several Broadway musicals in the 1950's, died on Friday at her home in Pomona, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died after a short illness, her family said.         Mrs. Harris, who was known professionally as Geraldine Delaney, appeared in "Where's Charley?," the original production of "Guys and Dolls," "Wonderful Town" and "Silk Stockings."         She is survived by her husband, Joseph, a theatrical producer and manager; three sons, James, of Pomona, Jeremiah, of New York City, and Joseph Jr., of Teaneck, N.J., and a daughter, Jennifer, of New York City.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died on Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases, she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her consulting work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians who were prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean, the sports car designer, was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas, and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Lucretia Speziale Robertson, an interior designer, died on Monday at her home in Montclair, N.J. She was 48 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         A native of Pittsburgh, she was a principal in Lang/Robertson Ltd., a residential and commercial design firm in Montclair that she helped to establish 17 years ago.         She and her partner, Donna Lang, published a book, "Decorating With Fabrics," and were working on a book on decorating with paper, scheduled for publication next year.         Mrs. Robertson is survived by her husband, William Sterling Robertson 3d, and two sons, Evan Alexander and Ian Stewart.       
         Vasiliki Johnides, who founded a Long Island restaurant popular with food critics and celebrities, died on Tuesday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, L.I.         Mrs. Johnides, known as Mama Bessie, celebrated her 92d birthday the day before. She lived in Sagaponack and died of a stroke and heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Johnides opened the Old Stove Pub in a farmhouse on Montauk Highway in Sagaponack in 1969 and remained active in its operation until her illness.         Her homestyle Greek taverna recipes won praise from the food critic Craig Claiborne. Later she expanded the menu to include steaks and chops.         The restaurant's clientele included Barbara Walters, Hugh L. Carey, Sidney Lumet, George Plimpton, Peter Maas, Elia Kazan, Gloria Vanderbilt, Truman Capote, Billy Joel, Calvin Klein, Mario Puzo and Joseph Heller.         Artists sometimes paid their bills with paintings. In busy periods, some customers helped to serve the food.         Born on the island of Limnos in Greece, Mrs. Johnides came to the United States at the age of 14. She was married for 57 years to John Johnides, who worked in real estate in Boston.  After he died in 1969, she opened the restaurant, joined by her children.         Surviving are two daughters, Coula and Helen, and two sons, Stephen and Constantine, also known as Gus, all of Sagaponack.

         Dr. Maria Victoria Roque Cohen, who practiced internal medicine in the Bronx for 30 years, died on Monday at her home in Harrison, N.Y.         She was 61 years old. Her family said she died of breast cancer.         A native of Argentina, Dr. Roque Cohen came to the United States after her graduation from the National University of Cordoba Medical School. She and her husband, Dr. Sol Cohen, shared a private practice in Co-Op City. She was also an attending physician at Montefiore and Misericordia medical centers.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Roque Cohen is survived by two daughters, Michele and Jennifer, both of Harrison, and a brother, Alfredo of Cordoba.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died yesterday afternoon at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said. "I think it was probably the effects of the disease coupled with the fact that she was 83 years old," Ms. Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminisences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues.         While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor.         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me":         "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century."         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong docummentary by a California filmmaker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominently Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, she was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' " Lessons From the Family Cook         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer.         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers, while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may was well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941. Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         In 1943, she published "The Gastronomical Me," (Duell, Sloan & Pearce) followed by "Here Let Us Feast (Viking) in 1946. Her novel, "Not Now But Now," was published by Viking in 1947. Her translation from French of "The Physiology of Taste" was published in 1949, the same year that "An Alphabet for Gourmets" appeared.         "A Cordiall Water," a slender volume of folk cures, was published by Little, Brown in 1961. Three years later, the same publisher brought out "A Map of Another Town," a reminiscence of the years she spent in Aix-en-Provence. In 1968, Putnam published "With Bold Knife and Fork," and Mrs. Fisher joined Julia Child and Michael Field as consultants to the Time-Life book "The Cooking of Provencal France."         Throughout these decades, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Fried two years later. An Appetite for Writing         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Viking.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991.         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say," she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Deborah R. Linfield, a senior litigation attorney for The New York Times Company, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her family said Ms. Linfield, who had never smoked, died of lung cancer, which was diagnosed 19 months ago. She had recently been accepted into a research treatment program conducted by the National Institutes of Health at the Garden State Cancer Center in Newark and had been there last week for an initial treatment with radiated monoclonal antibodies.         Ms. Linfield, a 1978 graduate of the New York University School of Law, where she was awarded the American College of Trial Lawyers Medal for Excellence in Advocacy, had been a litigation associate at Willkie Farr & Gallagher for two years and then at Baer Marks & Upham for seven years before joining the Times Company in 1987. She received a Bachelor of Science with honor in psychology from Tufts University. First Amendment Cases         At the Times Company, Ms. Linfield was active in a number of areas of litigation, but her specialty was First Amendment cases involving the press's right of access to court proceedings. She successfully argued for The Times in broadening access rights in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the prosecution of Mario Biaggi, and in New York State's Appellate Division for both the Howard Beach racial-attack case and Joel B. Steinberg child-brutality case.         She was an active member of the City Bar Association and served on both the Committee on Communication Law and the Committee on Women in the Profession.         Ms. Linfield is survived by her 9-year-old daughter, Sarah Linfield Mattingly; by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan L. Linfield of Brooklyn, and by her sister, Susan Linfield of Manhattan.

The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941:         "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it." Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         She saw little room at the table for caution. In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters.

         Yoshiko Uchida, a writer of children's books about the Japanese-American experience, died on Sunday at the Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 70 years old and lived in Berkeley.         She died after a stroke, said her literary agent, Barbara Kouts.         Ms. Uchida wrote 29 books from 1949 to 1991. They included 27 books for children, a volume of memoirs "Desert Exile: the Uprooting of a Japanese-American Family," which the University of Washington Press published in 1982, and "The Invisible Thread," an autobiography written for teen-agers and published by Julian Messner in 1991.         "The graceful and lively books of Yoshiko Uchida have drawn on the author's own childhood to document the Japanese-American experience" in fiction for her young audience, Patty Campbell wrote in a review of Ms. Uchida's "Happiest Ending" (Atheneum, 1985) in The New York Times Book Review.         She was born in Alameda, Calif., to parents who were both born and educated in Japan and then immigrated to California early this century. She was reared in Berkeley and received a B.A.  degree from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's degree in education from Smith College.         She is survived by a sister, Keiko Kakutani, who lives outside New Haven.       
         Maria Alba, a noted flamenco dancer and popular teacher in New York City, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Shigeko Suga, a spokeswoman for Miss Alba's family, declined to give Miss Alba's age.         She died of cancer, Miss Suga said .         Over a career of three decades, Miss Alba became known not only for the passion of her dancing but also for the hint of wry humor she brought to the flamenco stage. Her last performance was in May, in Miss Suga's flamenco-Butoh adaptation of Jean Genet's "Balcon," performed at La Mama in Manhattan. Miss Alba performed a memorably powerful, haunted wraith as the young prostitute Chantal.  Calm to Wild         Miss Alba's dancing ranged from understatement to earthy flamboyance. "She is not a Spanish dancer who needs to move quickly or to make a lot of noise with heel and toe beats," Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times in 1965. "She can do both with a fine fury, but they are only incidental elements in her arsenal of expressivity. She is, quite simply, one of those rare dancers who can stand still and make you hold your breath in anticipation of what might happen next."         Miss Alba, was was among New York's best-known flamenco teachers, conducted classes up to her death. Several generations of students, including Gelsey Kirkland and William Carter, worked with her in the battered old Fazil's Rehearsal Studio in the theater district, and at at universities around the country.         Miss Alba, who was an American of Irish ancestry, began her career as a Broadway gypsy, making her professional debut as dancer in the original production of "The King and I." She said she fell in love with flamenco after seeing a performance by Carmen Amaya, and studied with Mariquita Flores before traveling to Spain for lessons with Regla Ortega and La Kika. There Miss Alba became a star performer with the Ximenez-Vargas Ballet Espagnol.         She founded a troupe with Ramon de los Reyes in the mid-1960's and later had several companies of her own that toured throughout the world. She appeared for seven consecutive summers at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. Miss Alba also performed as a guest artist on many flamenco programs in New York.         She is survived by her stepmother, Ruth Fitzmaurice, and two brothers, Owen and James Fitzmaurice, all of Minneapolis.       
         The Rev. Page E. Smith Bigelow, one of the first women to be ordained in the Episcopal Church, died Wednesday in St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 69 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.         She died of cardiac arrest after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A graduate of Wells College and the General Theological Seminary in New York City, she was ordained in January 1977 after spending two years as a deacon. She served as a priest in the city's Episcopal Church Center, then as a vicar in West Milford, N.J. For the past six years her home parish had been St. George's Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Newark.         She is survived by her husband, William S.; a daughter, Page E., also of Maplewood; two sons, John O. 3d of Maplewood and William S. Jr. of Lebanon Township, N.J.; a sister, Thalia B. Husted of Mantoloking, N.J., and one grandchild.       
         Frances Brice Stark, Fanny Brice's daughter, who became a philanthropist and a well-known figure in show business circles, died on Sunday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         She died after several strokes and heart failure, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Stark was born in Huntington, L.I., the daughter of Nicky Arnstein and Miss Brice, whose radio and stage career was portrayed in "Funny Girl."         As a teen-ager, the daughter became an accomplished horsewoman, winning awards at Eastern horse shows and the National Horse Show. After graduating from the Dalton School in New York, she moved to California with her mother and often accompanied her on stage tours.         For nearly 52 years she was married to the Hollywood producer Ray Stark, who produced the movie "Funny Girl" in 1968. Together they made contributions to many charitable causes and were the hosts of many social and business events. She was a regular on lists of best-dressed women.         Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Wendy Stark Morrissey, and a brother, William Brice, both of Los Angeles, and one grandchild. A son, Peter, died in 1970.       
         Carole Mills Weinberg, a modeling agent and executive, died on Thursday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 49 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.         She was in Little Rock for treatment for cancer at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Center, her husband said.         Mrs. Weinberg was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to the United States with her family. After attending Northwestern University, she began modeling in Chicago and then taught modeling there.         Moving to New York City in the 1960's, she worked as an agent for the Sanford Leigh modeling agency, then became director of the television division of the Ford modeling agency and later director of the casting department at the Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn advertising company. She specialized in television commercials.         She and her husband, William P. Weinberg, became half-owners of Wilhelmina International Limited, the parent company of the Wilhelmina Artists and Wilhelmina Models. He was president of the Wilhelmina organizations, and she was on the board of directors. They sold their share in the company two years ago but remained as consultants for special projects.         Her survivors include her husband and her parents, Adam and Greta Boyce of Mount Prospect, Ill.       
         Tiki Freeman, who in the early 1970's became one of the first female cantors in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Eastchester, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         Mrs. Freeman died of cancer, said her husband, Joel.         Mrs. Freeman was born in Brooklyn, to Elias Gilner, one of the founders of the Haganah, the defense force raised by Palestinian Jews during the British Mandate, and Violet Sandheim, who had been private secretary to Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization.         Mrs. Freeman's family emigrated to Palestine in the mid-1930's, returning in 1941 as war began to sweep over the area.         Mrs. Freeman graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947. While raising a family, she built a singing career and her repertory ranged from operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan to folk songs and religious music. She was also a stage manager for many productions of Gilbert & Sullivan and other light operas for the Westchester Music Conservatory Opera Company.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Gail Weed Westcott, of Simsbury, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Yonkers, and Ethan, of London and Vienna; a brother, Rabbi Herbert Gilner of Chambersburg, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Audrey Phipps Holden, a philanthropist long active in New York and Connecticut, died on Sunday at New York Hospital while on a visit to the area.  She was 77 years old and in recent years lived in Hobe Sound, Fla.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Holden, the daughter of Gladys Mills and Henry Carnegie Phipps, was a board member of Phipps Community Development Corporation, a foundation involved in building low-income housing in the New York area. She was a supporter of the New York Zoological Society, Planned Parenthood and Liberation Programs Inc., a drug-rehabilitation project in Stamford, Conn., among other causes.         A collector of English antiques, she was a founding partner of Philip Colleck of London Ltd., an antique dealer in New York.         Mrs. Holden's husband, Philip Dana Holden, an investment banker, died in 1973. She is survived by three daughters, Beatrice Holden Guthrie of Jackson Hole, Wyo., Audrey Holden Charlson Denegre of New Canaan, Conn., and Sonia H. Evers of San Francisco; a son, Michael H., of Greenwich, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Caroline Miller Ray, whose first novel won the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for literature, died on Sunday at her home in Waynesville, N.C. She was 88 years old.         A son, George A. Miller, said the exact cause of death was not known.         Under the name Caroline Miller, Mrs. Ray burst upon the national scene with the publication of the prize-winning book "Lamb in His Bosom," a tale, derived from the history of her extended family, about a backwoods community in pre-Civil War Georgia.  Reviewing it for The New York Times Book Review, Louis Kronenberger wrote that it had "a wonderful freshness about it; not simply the freshness of a new writer, but the freshness of a new world," and that Mrs. Ray's strength was her ability to use words to paint "a wonderful large and vital picture."         At the time, she lived in Baxley, Ga., and was married to her first husband, William D. Miller. The Millers were divorced in 1936. In 1937, she married Clyde H. Ray Jr., a businessman in Waynesville. Mr. Ray died in 1976.         She published her second and final work in 1944, a novel called "Lebanon," which described the beauty of nature and the rhythm of rural life.         In addition to her son George, of Mountain Home, N.C., she is survived by two other sons, William D. Miller Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Clyde H. Ray 3d of Cullowhee, N.C.; a daughter, Caroline Ray Morgan of Annapolis, Md.; 17 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Debora Dammann Kramer, an administrator of mental health and social-welfare programs, died on Saturday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Mrs. Kramer was 54 years old and lived in Washington and in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a member of the family said.         Mrs. Kramer, after graduating from Radcliffe College, began her career in health care in the 1960's at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in Washington. She later headed nonprofit organizations devoted to helping children. She was executive director of the American Association of Psychiatric Services for Children from 1972 to 1979, which was based in Washington but moved in 1988 to Rochester.         From 1985 to 1987, Mrs. Kramer was executive director of the Committee for Food and Shelter in Washington, an advocacy group for the homeless, and a forerunner of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.         She was divorced from John R. Kramer in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Philadelphia, and Daniel, of Manhattan; two sisters, Penelope Johnston of Riverside, Conn., and Pamela Adams of Lexington, Me., and a grandson.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Mabel Randall Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in the creation of its programs to help troubled children, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness, her family said.         Miss Thomas served as the first full-time executive director of the organization, from 1952 until her retirement about 25 years later. Big Sisters eventually merged with the Big Brothers organization.         During her tenure, Big Sisters built a staff of social workers, psychologists and other professionals and opened offices in courts across the city to help neglected, delinquent or otherwise troubled youngsters. The annual caseload jumped from a relative handful to thousands. Her efforts won awards from the City Bar Association in New York and Community Trust.         Miss Thomas was born in Montgomery, Ala. She graduated from the University of Alabama in 1939. During World War II she worked on the staff of the U.S.O. at Fort McClellan, Ala., and later for the Red Cross. She resumed her studies at Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree in social work in 1952.         She is survived by two brothers, William of Montgomery and Walton of Milwaukee, and three sisters, Jean Walker of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Anna Atherton and Ethel Golson, both of Montgomery.         Correction:  July 21, 1992, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Mabel R. Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in helping troubled children, referred incorrectly to the status of the organization. It is independent, and separate from Big Brothers.       
         Olga Loeb, a trustee of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center who did volunteer work for more than five decades, died on Sunday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 97 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Loeb managed her gift shop at the hospital on Friday as usual and died at Northern Dutchess Hospital of complications after an asthma attack, said a hospital spokesman. She was on a family visit when she became ill.         She was a native of Vienna who moved to the Bronx in 1911.         As a girl, she collected pennies for a new dispensary that became a forerunner of the hospital that her future husband helped to found in 1927 -- Bronx-Lebanon on the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section. A Buyer for Store Chains         She studied at Syracuse University and then built a successful career buying merchandise for department-store chains. She returned to the Bronx at the age of 40 and married Dr. Martin J. Loeb, a surgeon and philanthropist.         Mrs. Loeb became active in the hospital's Ladies' Auxiliary in 1942 and had been its president since 1953. She also served as an officer or head of various hospital committees as well as the Comprehensive Planning Board for her local health district.         After her husband's death in 1961, Mrs. Loeb persuaded the hospital board to convert part of a waiting room into a gift shop that she would run with a few volunteers. It sells flowers and teddy bears among other things and has raised more than $1 million for the hospital. Mrs. Loeb herself opened the shop every weekday at 7:30 A.M. and closed it at 5 P.M.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         May Rudin, philanthropist and matriarch of one of Manhattan's real-estate dynasties, died yesterday at her East Side home. She was 95 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         A native of New York City, she was one of seven children born to immigrant parents. May Cohen dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and enrolled in a business school to study typing, stenography, bookkeeping and commercial law. She then went to work as a bookkeeper.         In 1923, she married Samuel Rudin, who four years later founded Rudin Management, realtors and builders, whose holdings now comprise dozens of tall buildings. The buildings, assembled over 60 years, were valued at $1.5 billion by analysts two years ago.         When Mr. Rudin died in 1975, his will established the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, of which Mrs. Rudin was the chairwoman at her death. Well into her 90's, she played an active part in its disbursements, which at last count, in 1990, came to 222 grants totaling $5.3 million. Sponsors of the Marathon         The foundation primarily supported education, social and religious welfare agencies, hospitals and health associations as well as museums and the performing arts. The money was spent mostly in Manhattan, where the Rudins' assets are concentrated.         The Rudins also were the first business sponsors of the New York City Marathon. From its inauguration in 1976 until 1990, May Rudin waited at the finish line each year to present the Samuel Rudin Trophy to the man and woman who broke the tape. Her husband, she noted, was keen on long-distance running well before it became fashionable.         Foundation beneficiaries included St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing, AIDS-related programs, Phoenix House and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center to public-school children, Lincoln Center and New York University, where the foundation endowed a chair in the humanities.         Mrs. Rudin is survived by her sons Jack and Lewis, respectively the chairman and the president of the family business, both residents of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Lillian Vorhaus Oppenheimer, who made origami, the intricate Japanese art of paper-folding, popular in the United States, died on Friday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a heart operation, her family said.         Mrs. Oppenheimer started doing origami in 1930 to entertain her daughter Molly, who was suffering from meningitis, and quietly continued it as a hobby.         That suddenly changed when a burst of publicity starting in 1958 featured her in newspapers and on national radio and television. Mail and calls poured in from experts and novices alike.         So she founded the Origami Center of America in her Gramercy Park penthouse and spawned other branches, saying, "Why should the Japanese have all the fun?" Today, about 30 countries have origami societies -- her daughter Rosaly co-founded those in England and Israel -- with annual conventions. The Magic of Paper         Mrs. Oppenheimer taught origami to kindergartners, scout troops, Yale students, corporate executives and nursing home residents.         "She saw magic in a piece of paper," the Friends of the Origami Center said. Meyer Berger wrote in The New York Times in 1958: "Jewels form under her fingers."         As the art's popularity spread, the American Museum of Natural History began decorating its Christmas tree with origami in 1972, starting a collection that grew to 5,000 adornments. Origami even proved useful to therapists. One handicapped teen-ager's first words -- "I made it" -- were uttered upon completing an origami object.         Origami, with ancient roots in China, entails folding paper into two- or three-dimensional objects in varied geometric, abstract, fantasy and real-life forms, from geodesic balls to umbrellas to dragons to ducks. Experts can do a simple piece in less than a minute; elaborate ones take hours.         Mrs. Oppenheimer was also a noted puppeteer, giving presentations into her late 80's, and was also active in the Storytelling Center of New York. Sometimes she combined all three interests, using origami puppets to tell stories. She wrote books on origami and puppets, including three with the puppeteer Shari Lewis.         Mrs. Oppenheimer was married to Joseph B. Kruskal and later to Harry C. Oppenheimer, both now deceased.         She is survived by three sons by Mr. Kruskal, William H. of Chicago, Martin David of Princeton, N.J., and Joseph Jr. of Maplewood, N.J., and a daughter, Rosaly Evnine of Jerusalem; four stepsons by Mr. Oppenheimer, Peter, of Walnut Creek, Calif., Jack, of Sonoma, Calif., Philip, of South Norwalk, Conn., and Herbert, of Manhattan; 26 grandchildren, and 30 great-grandchildren.       
         Katharine Bradley Lenhart, a volunteer active for decades in civic and social causes, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan and Waterford, Conn.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         Born in Nyack, N.Y., Mrs. Lenhart graduated from Vassar College and studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Bank Street College of Education. She worked as a decorator before becoming executive secretary of the Spence School.         Mrs. Lenhart had been active in charities that included the American Red Cross, Bellevue Hospital and the Child Care Volunteers of New York. She was a benefactor and past president of the former Masters Nursery.         Mrs. Lenhart was involved in rehabilitating deserted buildings and transforming vacant lots into pocket parks or gardens in the South Bronx, an experience she turned into a play, "The Greening of Rosita." She was a founding director of West Farms Land Trust in Waterford and sat on the boards of the Hudson River Conservation Society and the Tappan Zee Historical Society.         Mrs. Lenhart is survived by three sisters, Helen B. Buckland of Farmington, Conn., and Mary B. Blake and Elizabeth B. Brookfield, of Nyack, and a brother, Dr. E. Tremain Bradley of Norfolk, Conn.       
         Alberta Smith Jacoby, a film maker and lecturer on mental health, died on Wednesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jacoby, a specialist in mental-health education, had been a member of the faculty of Yale University for the last 25 years and remained a lecturer on public health at the time of her death. She taught and produced documentaries at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, a part of the Yale School of Medicine.         She was born in Worthington, Minn., was an alternate on the 1928 Olympic diving team and became a champion golfer. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota and received a master's degree in public health from Yale in 1967, the year she joined the faculty.         She began to show films on health during World War II as a program director for the Office of War Information, an information officer at the Public Health Service and, finally, chief of information for the National Institute of Mental Health.         She went into film making herself in 1949, when she and her director-husband, the late Irving A. Jacoby, formed the Mental Health Film Board. A production company, it made more than 100 documentaries, some of which won awards, on subjects such as psychiatric illnesses, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and hospice care.         At Yale, she taught a course entitled Health Communications. With her assistance, student crews made films about local health agencies to educate the public about what the agencies did.         Mr. Jacoby died in 1985. She is survived by six children, Clair Haycraft Johnson of Maui, Hawaii, Sara Haycraft Sparrow of North Branford, Conn., Peter Altman of Boston, Leslie Altman Rescoria of Havertown, Pa., Tamar Jacoby of Manhattan, and Oren Jacoby, also of Manhattan; three brothers, Paul Smith of St. David's Island, Bermuda, and Robert and Sidney Smith, both of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on July 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan. Studied Greek Jewish Group         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Irene Silva de Santolalla, a Peruvian educator and author who in 1956 became the first woman in the country to be elected senator, died on Thursday at her home in Lima, the capital. She was 90 years old.         Her family said yesterday that she died after a long illness. Further details were not available.         Mrs. Santolalla was honored by many governments for her writing on children and adolescents and her efforts to raise awareness of the importance of family relations. The Union of American Women, a private group based in Washington with chapters in most Latin American countries, named her its Woman of the Americas in 1956.         The Peruvian Government honored her with its highest award, the Order of the Sun, 10 years ago.         Elected to the Senate in 1956, she served for six years and won praise as the author of a law on family education enacted in Peru in 1957.         Mrs. Santolalla also founded Government institutes for training teachers in Peruvian cities and was a sought-after lecturer throughout Europe and Latin America on family education and child development.         She wrote several books on the conditions faced by children and adolescents and served as an adviser to the United Nations and two of its agencies, Unesco and Unicef.         She is survived by her husband of 71 years, Fausto Santolalla Bernal, 101 years old; two daughters, Irene Santolalla Silva and Maria Teresa Santolalla Silva, and a son, Javier Santolalla Silva, all of Lima; nine grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.       
         Linda J. Laubenstein, a Manhattan physician who in 1981 discovered some of the first mysterious cases of what became the worldwide AIDS epidemic, died on Saturday at her summer home in Chatham, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 45 years old.         Her family said an autopsy was pending. She suffered from severe asthma and weakness from childhood polio, an illness that required three major operations and left her a paraplegic at the age of 5.         "She is incredibly important in the history of AIDS, a genuine pioneer and a real fighter for what she believed," said Larry Kramer, an author and a leader in AIDS causes.         Dr. Laubenstein inspired the character of Dr. Emma Brookner, a principal role in Mr. Kramer's play on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, "The Normal Heart." He said an agreement was near on the production of a movie version by Barbra Streisand, with Ms. Streisand playing the Laubenstein-Brookner part.         Dr. Jeffrey B. Greene, a colleague, called Dr. Laubenstein "the ultimate AIDS physician." Despite her handicap, she met patients in the emergency room in the middle of the night and even made house calls, using her motorized wheelchair and public buses. "She was sicker than most of her patients but didn't let it stop her," Dr. Greene said. First Paper on Subject         Dr. Laubenstein and Dr. Alvin Friedman-Kien wrote the first paper to be published in a medical journal on the alarming appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma, a previously rare disease of lesions of the skin and other tissues. Most of the cases were in young gay men suffering a puzzling collapse of the immune system.         Recalling one of the first cases, she described a 33-year-old man with two purple spots behind his ears. Initially he responded to the cancer drugs she prescribed. But 18 months later he was dead, his body covered with 75 lesions.         Many more cases followed. By May 1982, she had seen 62 patients with AIDS -- a fourth of the national total recorded at the time. She said then that "this problem certainly is not going away."         Her father, George Laubenstein, said yesterday, "She told us from the very beginning that this is going to be a terrible epidemic."         Dr. Laubenstein's private practice grew to be predominantly AIDS cases. She and Dr. Freidman-Kien arranged the first full-scale medical conference on AIDS, at New York University in 1983. She also help to found the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research Fund in 1983. Jobs in Office Services         In 1989, she and Dr. Greene founded Multitasking, a nonprofit organization selling office services to other businesses and employing people with AIDS as the workers. Her concern was that AIDS patients often lost their jobs and that work was vital to emotional and physical health as well as for financial support.         Dr. Laubenstein was outspoken about what she said was the neglect by government and society in fighting AIDS. Some of her views were controversial among gay groups, particularly her belief that bathhouses should be shut down to discourage unsafe sex.         Born in Boston, she grew up in Barrington, R.I. She graduated from Barnard College and New York University Medical School. Her specialties were hematology and oncology, and she was a clinical professor at the New York University Medical Center.         Surviving are her parents, George and Priscilla of Harwich Port, Mass., and a brother, Peter of Melvin Village, N.H.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Rodgers, a writer, interior decorator and inventor and the widow of the composer Richard Rodgers, died at her home in Manhattan yesterday. She was 83 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughters, Mary Rodgers Guettel of Manhattan and Linda Rodgers Emory of Katonah, N.Y.         Mrs. Rodgers, whose maiden name was Feiner, was born in New York City. She attended the Horace Mann School and studied art and interior design at Wellesley College from 1926 to 1928. In 1930 she married Mr. Rodgers, who collaborated with the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d on musicals including "Oklahoma!," "South Pacific," "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music." Mr. Rodgers died in 1979.         Mrs. Rodgers founded Repairs Inc., an agency that hired craftsmen to repair broken objects, in 1935 and was its head until 1941. In 1945 she patented the Jonny Mop, which was sold by Johnson & Johnson. It was one of several inventions. In 1958 she created the Basically Yours dress pattern for McCall's, and in 1972 she patented the Turn and Learn storybooks, sold by the Ideal Toy Company. Books for Home and Family         Mrs. Rodgers wrote several books on home design and entertaining, including "My Favorite Things" (1964) and "The House in My Head" (1967). With her daughter Mary, she wrote "A Word to the Wives" (1970), which offered advice on mother-daughter relations. The book led to a nationally syndicated radio program in 1971 and 1972 and a monthly column for McCall's magazine called "Of Two Minds," which ran from 1971 to 1979.         Mrs. Rodgers was an officer of many charitable and arts organizations, including the Authors League of America, the American Institute of Interior Designers, the Public Education Association, the Museum of Modern Art, the American Red Cross, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Jewish Museum.         In addition to her daughters, she is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan.         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Virginia Sale, a character actress whose career in theater, film, radio and television spanned more than four decades, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 93 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Miss Sale was best known for her work in Hollywood, where by her count she played more than 300 supporting roles in films, beginning with silent comedies in 1927 and concluding with "Slither" in 1970.         She also appeared for eight years in the radio serial "Those We Love," and she wrote and starred in "The Wrens' Nest," one of television's first family comedies, which was broadcast by ABC in 1949. She was frequently seen on the Garry Moore and Kate Smith shows and in other television comedies, including "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres."         Miss Sale also won acclaim for her one-woman show, "Americana Sketches," in which she drew upon her upbringing in Urbana, Ill., to explore the foibles and humor of small town-America.         Miss Sale attended the University of Illinois for two years and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her films included the 1930 "Moby Dick," with John Barrymore, and a string of Westerns, including "Badman's Territory" and "Trail Street," with Randolph Scott.         Miss Sale's husband, Sam Wren, an actor and director, died in Hollywood in 1962.         She is survived by a daughter, Virginia Wren Moore of Lake Forest, Ill., and a son, Christopher S. Wren of Manhattan, who is editor of new projects for The New York Times.       
         Nguyen Thi Dinh, a leading figure in the Vietnamese Communist struggle against the French colonial Government and in the American war more than a decade later, died on Wednesday in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. She was 72 years old.         Her death was reported from Hanoi yesterday by the Reuters news agency. The cause was not given.         Vietnamese officials were quoted by Reuters as saying that Mrs. Dinh had been the outstanding woman in Vietnam's modern history.         Mrs. Dinh was one of six vice presidents of Vietnam's Council of State, a sort of collective presidency, having been named to the post in 1987. She was a former member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party. Ranking Woman in Vietcong         In the 1960's, Mrs. Dinh emerged as the senior woman within the Vietcong insurgency against the American-allied South Vietnamese Government. She was a member of the Presidium of the National Liberation Front, the political form of the Vietcong.         The Soviet and Chinese press identified her as deputy commander of the Vietcong guerrillas in 1965, at a time of large-scale American entry into the war.         Simultaneously, she headed the Women's Liberation Association, an organization with village cells in areas controlled by the Vietcong.         Mrs. Dinh was believed to be a widow; details of her family life were not known. She was born in 1920 in southern Vietnam, then part of French Indochina. In her childhood, nationalist and revolutionary groups had started operating against the French colonial administration. She joined one of them, the clandestine Vietnamese Communist Party, at the age of 18. The authorities sent her to prison for three years in 1940 because of her role.         Mrs. Dinh's body will lie in state in Ho Chi Minh City. She will buried there tomorrow.       
         Lillian Vallish Foote, a theater and film producer who worked closely with her husband, the playwright Horton Foote, died on Wednesday in Princeton, N.J. She was 69 years old and had homes in New York City and Wharton, Tex.         She died after a short illness, the family said.         Mrs. Foote was the producer of several plays and films, among them "1918," "On Valentine's Day" and "Courtship," all of which were written by her husband. Her other credits include "The Roads to Home" at the Manhattan Punchline Theater and the three part mini-series "Story of a Marriage," also by her husband, broadcaston public television in 1987.         Mrs. Foote, a native of Mount Carmel, Pa., was a graduate of Radcliffe College.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by four children, Barbara Hallie, Horton Jr., Walter and Daisy, all of New York City.       
         Alison L. Gertz, who contracted AIDS in a single encounter with a man at the age of 16 and drew international attention by telling her story as a warning to heterosexuals, women and teen-agers, died yesterday afternoon at her family's summer home in Westhampton Beach, L.I.         She was 26 years old and lived in Manhattan. Her parents, Jerrold and Carol Gertz, said she died of AIDS.         When Ms. Gertz first publicly told her story, in an interview with The New York Times in 1989, the AIDS epidemic was widely perceived as confined to homosexual men, intravenous drug abusers and blood-transfusion recipients.         She fit none of those categories. Her story was all the more dramatic because of the privilege she was born into, with artistic talent, affluence, private schools and social prominence. Public Crusader         Ms. Gertz became a crusader, speaking at schools, colleges and public events. She appeared on the cover of People magazine, Esquire named her woman of the year and her story was printed overseas.         Her many television appearances included "20/20," "Good Morning America," "Sally Jessy Raphael" and "Joan Rivers." Some celebrity interviewers became concerned friends. A film she recorded for the World Health Organization was first shown at the United Nations on World AIDS Day in 1989 and has since been shown internationally.         Molly Ringwald portrayed her in "Something to Live For: The Alison Gertz Story," a two-hour ABC network special that was broadcast on March 29. It prompted 189,251 calls to the Federal AIDS telephone line in 24 hours, a record. A majority of the calls were from women.         Dr. Mathilde Krim, co-founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, called her a pioneer in educating middle-class heterosexuals.         Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, has praised the ABC movie and said Ms. Gertz delivered "a powerful message to all Americans about the realities of AIDS." Hopes Suddenly Dimmed         An only child, Ms. Gertz was born in Manhattan and grew up on Park Avenue. Her father, the grandson of a founder of Gertz department stores, is a real-estate investor. Her mother cofounded a national chain of fashion stores, Tennis Lady.         Educated at Horace Mann School, Ms. Gertz studied art at Parsons School of Design. At 22, she was beginning a career as an illustrator.         "I was just, as they say, starting out in life," she said, with hopes of marriage and children.         But she began suffering puzzling ailments that eluded treatment. Finally, in 1988, she checked into Lenox Hill Hospital for tests. The ultimate diagnosis was AIDS.         The mystery of how she had become infected remained; her boyfriend at the time and a previous one tested negative. Eventually she looked up an old friend with whom she spent one romantic evening six years earlier, when AIDS was virtually unknown. He, it turned out, was bisexual and had since died of AIDS.         With medication, Ms. Gertz recovered from her initial illness and started on her mission.         "Unfortunately, a lot of people just flip by" AIDS reports about gay men and addicts, she said. "They think it doesn't apply to them. They can't turn the page on me. I could be one of them, or their daughter, and they have to deal with this." Encouraged Others         She received thousands of letters from around the world. She encouraged others who made their cases public, including Elizabeth Glaser, the wife of a television actor, who addressed the Democratic National Convention, and Mary Fisher, a former aide to President Gerald R. Ford who will speak to the Republican convention.         Friends of the Gertz family founded Concerned Parents for AIDS Research and have raised more than $1 million, and Ms. Gertz's friends hope to carry out her idea for an AIDS care program named Love Heals.         She is survived by her parents, who live in Manhattan.       
         Hope Yandell Hanes, who bred and raced champion horses, died yesterday at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 86 years old.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Hanes started racing horses in the 1930's. Her husband, John Wesley Hanes Sr., joined in the venture, and they owned many stakes winners in England, Ireland and the United States. They were involved in the syndication of Nashua, Royal Charger and My Babu.         She was also a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and was an amateur painter, sculptor and writer.         Born in Danville, Ky., Mrs. Hanes grew up there and in Greenwich, Conn. She was educated at Bryn Mawr College, where she formed a lifelong friendship with her roommate, Katharine Hepburn.         She was married for 55 years to Mr. Hanes, who died in 1987. He was an Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Roosevelt Administration, the head of the New York Racing Association and a part owner in the company that made Hanes hosiery and underwear.         Mrs. Hanes is survived by their daughter, Susan H. Caldwell of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, June H. McKnight of Norwich, Vt., and Ormsby H. Matthiessen of Old Lyme, Conn.; a stepson, John W. Hanes Jr. of Alexandria, Va.; a brother, Lunsford P. Yandell of Scottsdale, Ariz.; 16 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Esther K. Gayner, a painter, sculptor and printmaker, died on Wednesday at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park. She was 78 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         She died of pneumonia, which was a complication of leukemia, her family said.         Mrs. Gayner, a native of Trenton, began her training at the Trenton School for Industrial Arts in 1929 and graduated from New Jersey Teachers College in Trenton. She took postgraduate art courses at several schools, including that of the Museum of Modern Art, and her work was exhibited widely in New York, New Jersey and as far away as Italy and Israel.         Over the years, she worked to gain recognition for female artists. She was a board member and past president of the National Association of Women Artists and was active in the Artists Equity Association, the American Society of Contemporary Artists and the Alliance of Queens Artists.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Irving C. Gayner; two sons, Stephen, also of Forest Hills, and Jay D., of Manhattan; a sister, Dorothy Kasman of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.       
         Jean T. Chorley, a former professional singer and a civic leader, died on Saturday at her home in Skillman, N.J. She was 88 years old.         She had a history of heart disease and died in her sleep, her family said.         From 1934-41 she sang professionally as a mezzo-soprano under the stage name of Jean Travers. She performed at Radio City Music Hall, with the St. Louis Opera Company, on the Rudy Vallee and Chase & Sanborn radio shows and in concerts nationally and in Canada and Europe.         She was born Jeanette Baumohl in Manhattan. Her first husband, Morris Treistman, died in 1937. She remarried in 1941, to Kenneth Chorley.         Mr. Chorley, a close associate of Laurance S. and John D. Rockefeller Jr., served for 23 years as president of the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project and was an officer of several nonprofit organizations.         During that period, Mrs. Chorley and her husband entertained foreign officials and royalty. In the 1950's they restored an old brick farmhouse in Hopewell, N.J., and filled it with 18th-century antiques and English pottery. Mr. Chorley died in 1974.         Mrs. Chorley served as the board president of the Old Barracks Association, an American Revolution historical organization in Trenton, and also coached the lay readers at the Trinity Episcopalian Church in Princeton.         Surviving are a stepson, Edward C. Chorley of White Plains, 5 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Marian A. Granowitz, a former vice chairwoman of the Republican State and Westchester County Committees, died on Thursday at Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 78 years old and a lifelong resident of Port Chester, N.Y.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         Mrs. Granowitz's unpaid party work was a labor of love. Moving steadily up the ladder of leadership in the Westchester organization in the 1970's and 1980's, she served as its vice chairwoman, then regional vice chairwoman to coordinate Republican activities in five counties. She finally became a state vice chairwoman.         Born in Port Chester, she graduated from public high school and went to work for B. Altman's White Plains store. She headed its cosmetics department but quit to raise her children.         Her husband, Irving M. Granowitz, a certified public accountant, died in 1975.         Mrs. Granowitz is survived by two daughters, Ida Granowitz of Manhattan, and Tina Marks of Hartsdale, N.Y.; a son, Philip of Stanford, Conn.; a brother, Milton Smith of Port Chester, and three grandchildren.       
         Antoinette M. Kraushaar, the owner of one of New York City's oldest art galleries, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes related to old age, said Carole Pesner, the director of Kraushaar Galleries Inc.         Miss Kraushaar was born in Manhattan on Dec. 25, 1902, into a family of art dealers, and she spent her life in the New York art world. While still a teen-ager, she went to work as a stenographer in the gallery that her uncle, Charles W. Kraushaar, founded in 1885 and that her father, John Kraushaar, inherited at his brother's death in 1917. Originally on Broadway at 33d Street, Kraushaar Galleries has moved five times in its 107-year history; since 1981, it has occupied a floor in 724 Fifth Avenue, a gallery building near 57th Street. Mrs. Pesner said yesterday that the gallery would continue to operate.         In its first years, the gallery concentrated on European artists, especially the Barbizon School of landscape painters. Under Miss Kraushaar's father, it became known for its close association with American artists. For many years it was the primary representative of the sculptor Gaston Lachaise, the painters Guy Pene du Bois and Charles Demuth, and several members of the group of American realists known as "the Eight," most notably George Luks, William Glackens, Maurice Prendergast and John Sloan.         In 1917, Luks painted a full-length portrait of Miss Kraushaar in a white graduation dress that has been widely reproduced and exhibited over the years. In the 1920's, Lachaise also sculptured a head of the dealer. Earlier this year, she gave the Luks portrait to the Brooklyn Museum, where it is on view in conjunction with the current exhibition "The Eight."         Miss Kraushaar took over the running of the gallery when her father became ill in the 1930's and became its owner at his death in 1946. She retired from its day-to-day management in 1988. Under her tenure the gallery continued to exhibit American realists. In the last decade, it has mounted large shows of Glackens and Sloan, and it continues to represent the Luks estate. But it also represents abstract artists, including William Kienbusch, Carl Morris and Sonia Gechtoff.         In 1961, Miss Kraushaar was among the handful of New York gallery owners who founded the Art Dealers Association of America; she served for many years on its board. In her later years, she was known for her receptiveness to younger art dealers and the work they exhibited.         She is survived by a nephew, Charles W. Kraushaar of Manhattan.       
         Marie Paxton, an actress who appeared in many Broadway plays, died on Aug. 16 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center after a brief illness. She lived in New York City.         Her family would not give her age or the cause of death.         Miss Paxton was born in London, the daughter of the English actor Sydney Paxton and a descendant of five generations of actors. She began acting as a child, and first appeared in the United States in "Pickwick" in 1927 and "Napoleon" in 1928.         Miss Paxton moved to New York in the early 1940's and appeared in such Broadway productions as "The Three Sisters" with Katharine Cornell and Judith Anderson, "The Chalk Garden" with Gladys Cooper, "O Mistress Mine" with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and "Hadrian VII" with Alec McCowan.         Her last appearance on Broadway was as Lady Brockhurst in the 1970 revival of "The Boy Friend" with Sandy Duncan. Miss Paxton was Mrs. Higgins in the first national company of "My Fair Lady," and played that role more than 3,000 times in various productions.         She is survived by a niece, Patricia Paxton Jordan, of London.       
         Ruth Nelson, an actress in the legendary Group Theater that transformed American acting and whose career on stage, film and television spanned nearly 70 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer complicated by a stroke and pneumonia, her family said.         Ms. Nelson began acting in the early 1920's and last appeared onstage in "Uncle Vanya" in New York last year and on film in the 1990 movie "Awakenings."         During the 1930's she was a charter member of the Group, which gave birth to modern American acting. The Group infused its work with new psychological insights, naturalistic style and political content. It produced many top actors, directors and acting teachers, including Lee J. Cobb, Morris Carnovsky, John Garfield, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Stella Adler and Lee Strasburg, and led to new techniques, including the Method. 'They Couldn't Applaud Any More'         In a great moment of theater history, Ms. Nelson was the taxicab driver's wife in the original cast of Clifford Odets' "Waiting for Lefty." On opening night in 1935, the audience gave an extraordinary 45-minute ovation.         "When they couldn't applaud any more, they stomped their feet," she later recalled. "All I could think was, 'My God, they're going to bring the balcony down!' It was terrible, it was so beautiful."         For 33 years she was married to John Cromwell, founder of the Screen Directors Guild. Among his directing credits were "Of Human Bondage," in which Miss Nelson played the wife, "Algiers," "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" and "The Goddess."         But when Mr. Cromwell was accused of Communism in the 1950's -- a charge he denied in Congressional testimony -- his career went into a blacklisted eclipse. At the time, Ms. Nelson was offered a New York stage role as a wife in what turned out to be a monumental play, "Death of a Salesman." She turned it down to stay in Los Angeles to help her husband through his ordeal.         Mr. Cromwell died in 1979. A Nun's Encouragement         Born in Flint, Mich., Ms. Nelson grew up on the vaudeville circuit with her mother, Eva Mudge, a noted quick-change artist. Then she went to Los Angeles to study at a Roman Catholic school. Although her mother had discouraged Ms. Nelson from a show business career, a nun saw her potential and nudged her to Broadway.         Her stage performances won critical praise. Her film debut came in 1944 in four movies, and she made nine more in the next four years. Her later films included Robert Altman's "3 Women" and "Wedding" in the 1970's.         In a 1966 review in The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote that her portrayal of Mrs. Antrobus in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth" was "very easily the best" he had seen. "Miss Nelson misses no nuance of reality that the part offers, and in one moment -- when she mourns her murdered son Abel -- she touches true elegy," he wrote.         Her first marriage, to actor William Challee, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two sisters, Linda Stack of Darien, Conn., and Gay Samuelson of Los Angeles; a stepson, James Cromwell of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.

         Helen Findlay, a prominent figure in the arts in Chicago and the director of the Wally Findlay Galleries there, died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 83 years old.         She died after a long illness, said Bob Ryan, the treasurer of the gallery.         Miss Findlay, a native of Kansas City, Mo., and a Vassar graduate, was also treasurer of Wally Findlay Galleries International, which has headquarters in Chicago with branches on East 57th Street in midtown Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Fla., and in Paris. The galleries, founded in Kansas City in 1870 by William Wadsworth Findlay, are among the oldest to remain in the families of the original owners.         After Vassar, Miss Findlay joined her family at the Findlay Galleries in Kansas City. Her brother Walstein C. Findlay Jr. established the Chicago branch in 1932, and she was involved in the business there since the early 1940's.         The Municipal Art League of Chicago cited her as Woman of the Year in 1959, and Gov. James R. Thompson proclaimed Dec. 16, 1980, to be Helen Findlay Day in honor of her contributions to the arts and, as a fund-raiser, to charity.         In addition to her brother, who lives in Palm Beach, she is survived by another brother, William A. Sr., of the Florida Keys.       
         Mary Wells Ashworth, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, died on Saturday at the Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Va. She was 89 years old and lived in Richmond.         Mrs. Ashworth died of a ruptured aorta, said her son, Osbourne Orlando Ashworth Jr. of Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Ashworth grew up in Florida and moved to Virginia with her family as a teen-ager. She graduated from Hollins College in Hollins, Va., in 1924, and later served on the college's board.         For many years, Mrs. Ashworth was a research associate of the historian Douglas Southall Freeman, the author of a multi-volume biography of George Washington. After Professor Freeman died in 1953, she and another research associate, John A. Carroll, wrote the seventh and final volume of Freeman's authoritative "George Washington, a Biography" published by Scribner's in 1957. The entire work won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1958 and Columbia University's Loubat Prize the same year.         Mrs. Ashworth also contributed to the World Book Encyclopedia and to the compendium "Notable American Women 1607-1950."         Mrs. Ashworth's husband, Dr. Osbourne O. Ashworth, a physician, died in 1945. In addition to her son Osbourne, Mrs. Ashworth is survived by another son, Dr. John Sheriden Ashworth of Richmond.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Judith N. Shklar, a professor of government at Harvard University, died Wednesday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 63 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of a heart attack, said Ariadne Valsamis, a Harvard University spokeswoman.         Professor Shklar specialized in 18th, 19th, and 20th century political and intellectual theory. From 1989 to 1990 she was president of the American Political Science Association, the first woman to head the nation's largest professional organization of political scientists.         In 1984 she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for exceptionally talented individuals.         In 1985 she was awarded the teaching prize of the Harvard University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Its citation described her as "demanding, rewarding, forthright, fair, and reasonable, a model of intellectual and human qualities rarely combined."         Born in Riga, Latvia, Professor Shklar emigrated with her family first to Sweden and then in 1941 to Canada. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill University and a doctorate in 1955 from Radcliffe College. She taught at Harvard since 1956.         Professor Shklar is survived by her husband, Gerald Shklar, a professor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine; two sons, David, of Cambridge, and Michael, of Leminister, N.H., and a daughter, Ruth, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Pamela Hollingworth, who drew national attention at the age of 5 when she was lost for eight days in a New Hampshire forest, died on Sept. 11 at her home in Orleans, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 56 years old and also had a home in Sarasota, Fla, where she retired recently.         She died of a heart ailment, her family said.         Miss Hollingworth was a former vice president of the American Cancer Society.         In October 1941, she was lost for eight days on Mount Chocorua, a 3,475-foot peak in the White Mountains National Forest, after wandering away from a picnic wearing only overalls and sneakers.         Her disappearance touched off a search by more than 400 rescue workers. She had nothing to eat but drank often from mountain brooks. Despite freezing nighttime temperatures, she was found unharmed two miles from the picnic site.         When the little girl was reunited with her father, her first words were, "Daddy, I've been waiting for you."         Miss Hollingworth was born in Lowell, Mass., and grew up there and in Chelmsford nearby. She graduated from Smith College in 1958 and started a public relations career in New York.         She became the editorial director of the Arthritis Foundation, corporate communications director for Lane Bryant, vice president for creative services at the Cancer Society and communications director of the United States Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund.         Survivors include her mother, Blanche, of North Conway, N.H., and a brother, Joseph E. Hollingworth Jr., of Carlisle, Mass.       
         Esta Brodey Huttner, a founder and longtime board member of the Karen Horney Foundation, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         Her family said she died of cardiopulmonary failure.         She underwent psychotherapy with a disciple of Karen Horney, the German-born psychoanalyst whose methods departed from Freudian orthodoxy. She then befriended Dr. Horney and was so impressed with the analyst's work that she joined a group of people who decided to carry it on.         When Dr. Horney died in 1952, the Karen Horney Foundation was formed. It raised funds to start a clinic that would offer affordable or free services and serve as a training center for psychotherapists.         The Karen Horney Clinic opened in Manhattan in 1955. Mrs. Huttner was vice chairman of the board of directors from then until 1975, and continued as a director into the 1980's.         Mrs. Huttner, who was born in Brooklyn, started a business career as a millinery buyer for a department store. From 1946 to 1960, she operated a Brooklyn glass factory, Peerless Art, creating hand-painted designs on glass.         In 1975 she became the first national administrator for the Cancer Research Institute in Manhattan, which finances immunological research looking for a cancer cure. Mrs. Huttner retired in 1983.         Mrs. Huttner is survived by a son, Dr. James F. Brodey of West Hartford, Conn.; a stepson, Richard Huttner of Middletown, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Hilary Fylstra of Lake Tahoe, Nev.; a sister, Celia Hartley of New Port Richey, Fla.; and four grandchildren.       
         Mary Norton, a writer of children's books whose series about the tiny Borrowers was acclaimed by adults and devoured by legions of children, died on Saturday at her home in Hartland, England. She was 88 years old.         She died of a stroke, said Wendy Schmalz of Harold Ober Associates, a New York literary agency.         A creator of fantasy for children, Mrs. Norton enchanted readers of all ages with her stories of the ingenious family of Borrowers, people barely six inches high who own nothing, share freely and shamelessly borrow whatever they need from human beings. Winning Literary Acclaim         The first of the series was "The Borrowers," which won the Library Association Carnegie Medal in England as the outstanding children's book of 1952. American critics celebrated the book when it was published in the United States the next year.         Jane Cobb, writing in The New York Times Book Review, described "The Borrowers" as "a charming story, beautifully written," that brought to mind "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Wind in the Willows."         Three sequels -- "The Borrowers Afield" (1955), "The Borrowers Afloat" (1959) and "The Borrowers Aloft" (1961) -- were also highly praised, with some critics comparing her work to classics by Jonathan Swift and Charles Dickens. Mrs. Norton once again turned to the little people 21 years later in "The Borrowers Avenged," a story laced with humorous observations on the human condition. A Witch and a Flying Bed         Her first book, "The Magic Bed-knob; or, How to Become a Witch in 10 Easy Lessons," published in 1943, was the story of three children, a spinster learning to become a witch and a flying bed. Reviewing it in The Times Book Review, Ellen Lewis Buell said: "No one can tell for certain when a classic is born, but this story has all the makings of one." A revised version of the story and its sequel, "Bonfires and Broomsticks," appeared in 1957 as "Bedknob and Broomstick." In 1971 the book was made into the Walt Disney film "Bedknobs and Broomsticks," which starred Angela Lansbury.         Mrs. Norton, the daughter of a physician, was born in London on Dec. 10, 1903, and educated at a convent school. During World War II she worked first in England for the War Office and then in New York for the British Purchasing Commission. It was in the United States that she started to write short stories and articles to help support her children. Encouraged by American editors, she wrote down some of the stories she told her own children.         She is survived by two sons, Robert and Guy, and two daughters, Ann-Mary and Caroline.       
         Dorothy Disney MacKaye, who chronicled marital woes and dispensed advice for 30 years through a column in The Ladies' Home Journal, "Can This Marriage Be Saved?", died on Saturday at her summer home in Guilford, Conn. She was 88 years old and lived in Guilford and Washington.         She died of a heart attack, said her son, William R. MacKaye of Washington.         Mrs. MacKaye, who wrote under the byline Dorothy Cameron Disney, was something of a pioneer both as an advice columnist and a marriage counselor, and for generations of readers her column -- entertaining, occasionally titillating, sometimes a little pedantic -- served as a spyglass into the lives of anonymous strangers.         The column, which first appeared in January 1953, continues today. In Mrs. MacKaye's hands it was devoted each month to the travails of a married couple. Based on interviews and then written largely in dialogue, as if in the voices of the troubled partners, the columns dealt with issues like jealousy, infidelity, money problems and, increasingly as time went on and moral strictures relaxed, sexual problems.         "The columns seem to represent a chronicle of the many changes in the institution of marriage -- and the fascination it holds," Mrs. MacKaye said in a retrospective essay written for the 100th anniversary issue of The Ladies' Home Journal in January 1984. Looking back on her three decades as a columnist, she concluded that of all marital problems, "the single greatest pitfall of all times" is the inability of husband and wife to communicate. " 'He (or she) never listens' is universal," she wrote.         By the time she began her career as a columnist, she was the author of nine mystery novels, and she believed she was successful as a columnist, her son said in an interview, because of her training as a storyteller. Her technique, he said, was to take her prospective subject couple out to dinner to prime and cajole them and then afterward to speak with them separately. She would also interview their marriage counselor.         In the column, the names were never divulged and identifying details were not provided. "She would always tell the couples that unless they told their friends they'd never be recognized," her son said. "Those people who told their friends were invariably recognized -- and embarrassed."         In the beginning, the column was a collaboration between Mrs. MacKaye and Dr. Paul Popenoe, the founder of the American Institute of Family Relations, a marriage counseling agency in Hollywood. Dr. Popenoe put her in touch with his patients, who then became her subjects. Later on, as the column became more well known, Mrs. MacKaye made it entirely her own, calling on counseling agencies across the country for source material.         Mrs. MacKaye was born in 1904 in Atoka, Indian Territory, part of what became the State of Oklahoma in 1907, and grew up in Muskogee. Her father, Loren G. Disney, was a lawyer and a local political figure. She attended several colleges, including George Washington University and Barnard College, but never graduated. Her son said her explanation for this was that she refused to take any science courses.         Mrs. MacKaye's marriage to Milton MacKaye, a magazine writer, endured for 50 years until his death in 1979.         In her addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter-in-law, Mary Anne MacKaye, and five grandchildren.       
         Anne G. Wilder, who led the expansion of Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit developmental theater in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wilder joined the Playwrights Horizons board in 1976 and was its chairwoman for the last 11 years. She helped raise money and guide the purchase of its building at 416 West 42d Street, which houses two theaters and administrative offices.         The organization sponsored many productions, some of which moved to Off Broadway, including Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," Jonathan Reynolds's "Geniuses" and Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic."         Among the writers, composers and lyricists supported by Playwrights Horizons have been Ted Tally, A. R. Gurney, Alfred Uhry, James Lapine, William Finn and Albert Innaurato.         Mrs. Wilder also produced two Off Broadway shows that received critical and popular note: "A . . . My Name Is Alice," a musical revue, and a trilogy of one-act plays, "Win/Lose/Draw."         Before her involvement in the theater, Mrs. Wilder was a volunteer, lecturer, trainer and board member of the New York City School Volunteer program.         She was born in Bayonne, N.J., and grew up in Englewood, N.J. She graduated from Connecticut College in 1950.         She is survived by her husband, Robert C. Wilder; a daughter, Rachel W. Smeragliuolo of Baltimore; two sons, Clinton D., of San Francisco, and Robert D., of Washington; a sister, Doris Gould of Atlanta, and a granddaughter.       
         Gladys Merrifield, a poet and editor, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Gail Merrifield Papp.         Mrs. Merrifield, a native of Colton, Calif., received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley, where she was awarded the Chamberlain Cook Prize in poetry, and did graduate studies at Columbia University. She was a staff writer and editor at Family Circle magazine from 1952 until the early 70's.         She published two volumes of poetry, "20th Reunion" (1984) and "Windows on Manhattan" (1986). Her work appeared in many poetry magazines and in two anthologies, "The Diamond Anthology" (1971) and "The View From the Top of the Mountain" (1982). In 1982, a selection of her work was read by Ruth Nelson as part of the Poets at the Public series at the Public Theater in New York City.         For her long narrative poem "The Roundabout Cafe: Manhattan," which formed part of "Windows on Manhattan," Mrs. Merrifield received the Robert Browning Award from the Robert Browning Society and the Mason Sonnet Award from the World Order of Narrative Poets.         Mrs. Merrifield's only survivor is her daughter, the widow of Joseph Papp, who founded the Public Theater.       
         Bertha Levin, a longtime supporter of Jewish causes in New York City and Israel, died on Thursday at her home in Jerusalem. She was 98 years old.         She had been suffering from pneumonia, a family spokeswoman said.         In New York Mrs. Levin was a founding member of the Young Israel Movement and a pioneer member of Hadassah who worked with its founder, Henrietta Szold, during World War I. She moved to Israel in 1961, where she served on the Committee to Beautify Jerusalem.         Born Bertha Lebendiger, she was a native of New York City. As a young woman she was a suffragette and was the first woman admitted to membership in the New York Credit Managers Association, in the World War I era.  For 25 years she was married to Harry Levin, a lawyer who died in 1945.         She is survived by two daughters, Tova Solter of Ramat Chen, Israel, and Ora Zohar of Jerusalem; three sons, David, of Manhattan, Ezra, of the Bronx and Jonathan, of Bethesda, Md.; 13 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.       
         Natalie deWolf Paine, a television production administrator at CBS News and at the Columbia University Seminars on Media and Society, died on Wednesday. She was 62 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.         Mrs. Paine's death was reported by her husband, Kenneth Paine, who said she died of cancer at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.         Mrs. Paine joined CBS News as a staff administrator in 1951 and served as staff administrator for the "See It Now" and "CBS Reports" programs, with Edward R. Murrow reporting and Fred W. Friendly producing.         Mr. Friendly described Mrs. Paine yesterday as "a central link, our gyroscope" in coordinating production and information gathering.         She resigned from CBS in 1964 to raise a family. In 1982 she rejoined Mr. Friendly, who was directing Columbia University's seminars on the media and society and helped to produce more than 600 of them.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Jenifer, of Boston; two stepdaughters, Emily Paine of Los Angeles and Rachel Wilson of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Janet Viertel, an underwater photographer, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. She was 77 years old and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Newark, she attended public schools and the School of Dramatic Art, New York University. She married Joseph Viertel and lived in Stamford, Conn., where she took part in civic activities. She became water resources chairman of the Connecticut State Board of the League of Women Voters, which awakened her interest in the coastal waters and oceans.         At the age of 50, when her children had grown up, she decided to become an underwater photographer, learned to dive and moved to St. Croix with her husband. The results were three books published by Grosset & Dunlap: "Undersea Gardens of the Virgin Islands" (1969); "Blue Planet, the Ecology of the Oceans" (1973), intended for high-school students, and "Underwater Holidays" (1978), a diving-and-snorkeling guide.         Her work was exhibited in one-woman shows at the Eastman Kodak galleries and at Grand Central Terminal in New York and at colleges and galleries around the country. She showed her work on television talk shows.         She always maintained a sense of humor about her work. Asked by a television interviewer which she enjoyed more, the scuba diving or photography, she replied: "The part I like best is when I come back to the surface and have a gin and tonic."         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Viertel is survived by a daughter, Alice Krieger of Manhattan; two sons, Tom of Manhattan, and Jack of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Joy Golden of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party. But when you've read the stories, your next party might may seem to you as if Laurie Colwin had written it."         Ms. Colwin's four novels were "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 1990), "Family Happiness" (Knopf, 1982), "Happy All the Time" (Knopf, 1978) and "Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object" (Viking, 1975). A Focus on Food         Her three collections of short stories were "Another Marvelous Thing" (Knopf, 1986), "The Lone Pilgrim" (Knopf, 1981) and "Passage and Affect" (Viking, 1974). Some of her work was adapted for stage and television.         She also worked as a translator for Isaac Bashevis Singer and wrote for The New Yorker, Mademoiselle and Redbook.         In 1987 Ms. Colwin won a Guggenheim fellowship.         Food was also a focus of her life.  During the campus uprisings at Columbia University in 1968, she cooked forstudent protesters occupying buildings. Later she was a volunteer and a cook for the Coalition for the Homeless and the Antonio Olivieri Shelter for Homeless Women.         She was also a food columnist for Gourmet magazine and wrote two volumes of essays and recipes, "Home Cooking" (Knopf, 1988) and "More Home Cooking" (HarperCollins, 1990).         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton.  Then she began trying her own hand at writing and sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of the Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.

         Patricia B. Ewell, who acted in Broadway plays in the 1920's, 30's and 40's, died on Sunday at her home in Dennis, Mass. She was 93 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Performing under her stage name, Patricia Barclay, Mrs. Ewell started her career with the Theater Guild. She appeared in plays with Claude Rains and Spencer Tracy, among others, and she also worked in regional theaters across the country.         The New York Sun praised "her simplicity, her natural beauty and her extraordinary talent." In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described her acting as "delightful."         Mrs. Ewell, whose maiden name was Riordan, was born in Manhattan.         Her marriage to Hardwick Nevin, a playwright, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband of 56 years, Richard Ewell, a retired actor.       
         Joan Mitchell, an American painter who was an important figure in the second generation of American Abstract Expressionists, died yesterday in a hospital in Paris. She was 66 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Robert Miller, her dealer.         An ecstatic and inventive colorist with a way of putting on the paint that was unmistakably her own, Miss Mitchell worked as much with memories of her childhood in Saugatuck, Mich., and of her youth on the East River in Brooklyn, as with the treasured landscape on which she looked out every day from her house above the town of Vetheuil, near Paris.         Throughout her life, she insisted that the tumultuous and airborne expression of feeling in her paintings was not a matter of instinct left free to run wild. As she said to the historian Irving Sandler: "The freedom in my work is quite controlled. I don't close my eyes and hope for the best." The historian Leo Steinberg once wrote of her ability "to score triumphantly for the willed act as against chance effect." Appreciation Grew         Like many another American expatriate, she sometimes felt herself underrated by New York opinion. But in recent years, working on a scale even larger than that favored by the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, she found both a glorious fulfillment in her work and an eager response from collectors and critics.         Her recent shows at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City won wide praise, and the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the National Gallery were among the museums that had recently bought major works of hers.         Joan Mitchell was born in Chicago on Feb. 21, 1926. She was the daughter of James Herbert Mitchell and Marion Strobel, co-editor with Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine. As a child, she came to know T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Thornton Wilder, Dylan Thomas and others as visitors to the family home.         As a young woman in Chicago, Miss Mitchell became acquainted with the great paintings by Cezanne, Matisse and others. She was a graduate of Smith College and later attended the art school of the Art Institute of Chicago, after which she came to New York. Won a Traveling Fellowship         Thanks to the $2,000 that came with an Edward L. Ryerson traveling fellowship from the institute, she spent a year in France in 1948-49, working first in Paris and later in Le Lavandou in Provence. While in France, she married Barney Rosset, the founder of the Grove Press publishing house.         Back in New York in 1950, she soon became accepted as a promising member of the downtown art scene. One of the few women to be admitted to membership in the influential Artists' Club, she participated in 1951 in the "Ninth Street Show" organized by the Club and supervised by Leo Castelli.         By the mid-1950's her work was admired by some of the best judges of the day. In 1957 she took part in "Artists of the New York School: Second Generation," organized at the Jewish Museum by Meyer Schapiro and introduced by Leo Steinberg.         A return to Paris in 1955, three years after her divorce from Mr. Rosset, led to a gradual withdrawal from New York and an ever-increasing identification with life in France. This was reinforced by her meeting with the painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, who was to be her companion from 1955 until 1979. Denied Monet Influenced Her         After the death of her mother in 1967, Miss Mitchell inherited enough money to buy a two-acre estate above Vetheuil, a little town on the Seine that is best known for the residence there of Claude Monet. She lived there permanently from 1968 until her death.         Her house looked out over a panoramic view of the river that inevitably put every visitor in mind of Monet. But Miss Mitchell was characteristically emphatic in her denials that Monet had had any influence upon her.         In recent years, a hip operation hindered her movements, though it did not prevent her from maneuvering the path from her house to her favorite restaurant far below.         Among her major retrospective exhibitions were those at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1974), the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1982), and in 1988 a touring exhibition that went to the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and elsewhere. Earlier this year, "Joan Mitchell Pastels" was seen at the Whitney Museum. In 1991 she received the Grand Prix des Arts from the City of Paris.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Maggie Comer Robinson, whose efforts to overcome her own impoverished background and inspire her children to pursue higher education were recounted in a biography and in a television documentary, died Monday at St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, Ind. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Robinson died of septicemia, a blood infection, said a son, Dr. James P. Comer of North Haven, Conn.         Her five children earned a total of 13 undergraduate and graduate degrees, and all seven of her grandchildren are college graduates.         It was Dr. Comer's recounting of his mother's life in "Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family," published by New American Library in 1988, that brought her to the nation's attention. PBS Documentary         Her story was retold in a Public Broadcasting Service documentary, "The Legacy of Maggie's American Dream," which was first broadcast last month.         Mrs. Robinson, who was born in Woodland, Miss., and reared in Memphis, moved to East Chicago in 1920. She met her first husband, Hugh Comer, in the New Hope Zion Church, where he was a deacon. He died in 1955, and she later married Ervin Robinson of East Chicago. Mr. Robinson died in 1985.         She was a member of the Mothers Board of the New Ebenezer Baptist Church and a vice president of the Washington High School P.T.A. Among the many honors she received after her biography was published was an honorary doctorate awarded last year by Wheelock College in Boston.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Robinson is survived by two other sons, Dr. Norman D. Comer and Dr. Charles Comer, both of East Chicago; two daughters, Louise Comer of Eufala, Ala., and Thelma C. Morris of Gary, Ind.; two sisters, Susie Cossey and Carrie Watkins, both of East Chicago; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz, a great-grandniece of Chief Sitting Bull, who devoted her life to making American Indian culture available to other Americans, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 85 years old and had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, and Douglaston, Queens, since 1928.         She died of cancer, said Marjorie Weinberg, a family friend.         As director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island from 1930 to 1950, Rosebud, as she preferred to be called, enthralled legions of visitors with information about and stories from Indian culture.         Rosebud, who was born near Rapid City, S.D., was a descendant of the Lakota-Oyate, called the Sioux by the white settlers. Through her family's prominence, she came to know many well-known figures like President Calvin Coolidge, whom she helped induct into Lakota membership in 1927; Cecil B. DeMille, who tried to persuade her to star in his films, and the planner Robert Moses, who hired her for the Jones Beach post.         Last year Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was her name that inspired Orson Welles to make "Rosebud" the last word spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of his 1941 film classic, "Citizen Kane." He based his assertion on what he said were recently discovered daily sign-in sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Mr. Welles and Rosebud worked on several dramatic shows during the late 1930's.         Mr. Welles, who died in 1985, never revealed the source for the name "Rosebud."         After leaving her post at Jones Beach in 1950, Rosebud continued to lecture and write on Indian culture. Her book, "The Album of the American Indian," was published in 1969 by Franklin Watts Inc., and a second book, "Tonewaya and the Eagles," was published in 1979 by Dial Press.         In 1989 Rosebud received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of South Dakota. She had attended the university from 1925 to 1927.         Rosebud's first husband, Arthur de Cinq-Mars, died in 1949. A sister, Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse, died in 1981.         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz is survived by her husband, Alfred Frantz; a daughter, Tachawin Moy, of Brooklyn; a granddaughter, Karen Winona Moy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Evelyn Robe Finkbeiner, of Bad Pyrmont and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.       
         Elinor Kridel Bernheim, a social-welfare volunteer whose widely cast interests ranged from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and Columbia University's School of Social Work to a community center she founded in the Bronx, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 85 years old.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Bernheim relentlessly made the rounds of board rooms, foundation offices and charity luncheons and dinners, starting in the 1940's. In 1975, she still sat on the boards of 11 charities. At the time, The New York Times's About New York column described her as "The Queen of Volunteers," who was "the champion volunteer worker in town."         "I love this kind of work," she said between meetings with people who held the purse strings to grants for worthy causes. Sometimes it kept her busy for 15 hours a day, she said.         "You know why we do it?" she asked. "Because it shows we're alive. So many of the younger women now want to get paid. It's a status thing with them."         "I'll tell you what I'm good at," she declared. "I'm good at finding people for boards because I know a lot of people. I'm good at organizing, fund-raising and whipping up enthusiasm.         "I don't fight with anyone unless I have to get things done -- and then I'm a dog, very mean." She also was a critic of professional social-work jargon that she said could scare otherwise interested laypeople off.         Mrs. Bernheim, whose late husband, Leonard, was a stockbroker, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1985. She recovered enough to return to the causes closest to her heart -- in a wheelchair or by telephone -- until her death.         Among those lasting interests were the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, which she began in the 1950's and presided over until 1970. It was innovative because it was affiliated with a hospital, Montefiore Medical Center. Others included the New York chapter of the National Council on Alcoholism and Young Concert Artists, which helps talented young people to start a career.         Also remaining dear to her heart was the New York School of Social Work at Columbia, a place where she did postgraduate work after her 40th birthday, in the 1947-48 academic year. She later served as a member of its advisory board and took special pride when Columbia awarded her its Bicentennial Medal in 1956. It was but one of many honors bestowed on her.         Mrs. Bernheim was born Elinor Kridel in New York City on June 26, 1907, and graduated from Vassar College in 1928. By 1941, she was a member of the board and the council of the Association for Aid for Crippled Children.         Her relationship with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies went back to her years as a young woman. She became a trustee in 1942 and two years later was co-host of a luncheon addressed by Eleanor Roosevelt.         She served as chairwoman of the women's division fund campaigns in 1943, 1944 and 1949. After that, she became a vice president of the federation and board chairwoman of the women's division.         Over the decades, Mrs. Bernheim also was an officer or otherwise involved in, among others, the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Conference for Social Welfare, an advisory committee on volunteer services for the Veterans Administration, the United Neighborhood Houses of New York City, the National Council on Social Work Education and the Associated Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations.         She was also involved with the Community Council of Greater New York, the Community Service Society, the National Homemakers Service Council and the Brookdale Institute on Aging, among others. She was a co-founder of the Florence G. Heller Research Center. She served three terms as vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York and was elected its first president in 1973.         Mrs. Bernheim's husband died in 1980. She is survived by two sons, Leonard H. Jr. and Charles A., both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Janice Gilbert Fulton, a bridge expert and game-show personality in the early days of television, was presumed dead after a boating accident last week near her home about 150 miles north of Haiti, her lawyer said yesterday.         The lawyer, Ian Miller, said that Mrs. Fulton's husband, David Fulton, 70 years old, a mining engineer, was also presumed dead, as was Dan Cooper, 45, a Canadian real estate developer who was a passenger when the Fultons' 22-foot fishing boat capsized in choppy waters on Thursday morning.         Mr. Miller said he notified the authorities when the Fultons failed to return to their home, on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.         He said rescuers found two survivors, Douglas Colledi of London, Ontario, and Lucien Vixama of Providenciales, in the Fultons' righted boat on Friday. A search of the Caribbean by private planes and the Coast Guard was called off on Sunday.         Family members said Mrs. Fulton was born in New York City about 1920. She played Little Orphan Annie on radio soap operas. Later she played the Paying Teller on the television give-away show "Break the Bank" in the 1950's.         In 1955 she married Tobias Stone of Las Vegas, Nev., a champion bridge player who taught her to play the game. They won the Goldman Pairs in 1957, making them the only married couple to win in the 64-year history of the event; they also won the Master Mixed Team Championship in 1965. She won three other national titles: the Women's Teams in 1956 and 1969 and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1965.         Mr. Stone and Mrs. Fulton divorced in 1975, and in 1980 she married Mr. Fulton, who had been the chief mining engineer in the Stone family gold and silver mining business, where she worked from 1974 to 1978.         Mrs. Fulton's first husband, William Miles, lives in Los Angeles. Her second husband, William Dunlop, is deceased. She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Miles of Los Angeles, and by a daughter, Leslie Coren of Hallandale, Fla.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Enid Schechter, who served as the executive assistant to four Speakers of the New York State Assembly in the Legislature's New York City office, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Ms. Schechter's 20-year career on the legislative staff included working for Speakers Stanley Steingut, Stanley Fink, Melvin Miller and Saul Weprin. Before her government work, she was an assistant to the president of London Records.         She was born in Great Neck, L.I., and was a graduate of Drew University.         Surviving are her husband, Martin; a son, Steven; a daughter, Susan Weprin, who is married to a nephew of the Speaker, and a granddaughter, all of Manhattan.       
         Alice I. Bryan, a psychologist who fostered the advancement of women in her profession and who led a major study on the role of libraries, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, her relatives said. Her death was reported yesterday by Columbia University, where she had taught for 35 years.         Dr. Bryan was a founder and president of the National Council of Women Psychologists. Its first meeting was held in her apartment. She was also an officer of the American Association for Applied Psychology and the American Psychology Association.         This year she addressed the American Library Association, which honored her on the 40th anniversary of her book "The Public Librarian." Based on interviews with more than 3,000 librarians, it explored the role of libraries as centers of mass communication.         Dr. Bryan started teaching part time at Sarah Lawrence College and Pratt Institute in the 1930's, and joined Columbia's Library School in 1939 as a psychologist and teacher. She became its first female full professor and helped organize its doctoral program. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Bryan, whose family name was Bever, was born in Kearny, N.J. Her marriages to Chester Bryan and Frank Blasingame ended in divorce. Her third husband, George V. Fuller, died in 1960.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Vanessa S. Lynn, a New York gallery director who wrote about contemporary American crafts, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center. She was 42 years old and lived in Valley Stream, L.I.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lynn held a B.A. degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton and an M.A. in library science from Queens College. During the 1970's she worked as an art and architecture librarian at Pratt Institute.         She was a founder, in 1979, of the Cooper/Lynn Gallery in Manhattan, which presented works in clay, fiber and metal. She was also an advocate for removal of the distinction between crafts and fine arts, a theme that permeated her writing.         In 1985, she became the director of Gallery at Workbench, based at the chain's main store at Park Avenue and 32d Street. It showed the creations of young furniture artists. She also traveled to Workbench's other stores in the city.         She was a regular contributor to periodicals, including American Craft, American Ceramics, Metalsmith, Ornament, Glass and the German crafts magazine Art Aurea. At the time of her death, she was associate editor of American Ceramics magazine.         Mrs. Lynn is survived by her husband, Lawrence R.; her mother and stepfather, Sylvia and Ralph Lippman of Manhattan; a brother, Keith Stanger of Ypsilanti, Mich., and four stepbrothers, David Lippman of Eureka, Calif., Dr. Jay Lippman of Manhattan, Jonathan Lippman of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Leonard Lippman of West Hartford, Conn.       
         Carol Weil Haussamen, a New York City philanthropist, hostess and Democratic fund-raiser, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer of the esophagus.         Mrs. Haussamen, a real-estate heiress, was born in Manhattan, the daughter of L. Victor Weil, a real-estate executive, and the former Beatrice Schwab. She attended private schools, including the Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, acquired fluency in French from her governesses and traveled extensively when her mother showed horses. In those years the family also kept an estate in Elberon, N.J., where she spent her summers. Hostess to Ambassadors         From her father she inherited, among other properties, a building on Central Park South, and with it a palatial 20th-floor, 18-room apartment. For the last 25 years or more her home served as a fountainhead of funds for Democratic candidates from around the country.         She served as hostess for foreign ambassadors during the 1976 national convention, and she often entertained other visiting foreign dignitaries as well. She played a role in every subsequent campaign, though her family said that in this Presidential election year she had to curtail her activities somewhat because of her health.         She was the president of the nonprofit Carol W. Haussamen and Carolyndale Foundations, which she dedicated to the rehabilitation of housing for the poor. She also headed Forty Central Park South Inc., a company that owns and manages apartment buildings.         She served in various capacities on the Governor's Committee on Scholastic Achievement, Just One Break Inc., Manhattan Industrial Home for the Blind, Community Board No. 5, First Women's Bank of New York, Urban Design Council, Citizens Housing and Planning Council, Association for a Better New York, Mayor's Midtown Committee and Roosevelt Island Development Corporation.         Her marriages to Crane Haussamen and Monroe Hemmerdinger ended in divorce.         Mrs. Haussamen is survived by a son, Dale Hemmerdinger of Manhattan; a daughter, Lyn Hemmerdinger of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.       
         Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         Mrs. Furman died of complications of diabetes, said her family, which reported her death yesterday.         Mrs. Furman, who was a graduate of Finch College, had suffered from diabetes since infancy. She devoted her life to urging the public in general and those suffering from diabetes in particular to press for more research that might lead to a cure.         The foundation is the chief private financial supporter of scientific research on diabetes.         The New York Juvenile Diabetes Foundation chapter is the largest of the organization's 126 chapters in the United States and abroad. Mrs. Furman helped found the volunteer organization in the early 1970's, and served a year's term as president from 1974 to 1975. She also held several other positions with the foundation.         In 1992, Mrs. Furman received the Shining Star Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for her "longstanding commitment to find the cure for diabetes."         Mrs. Furman is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Julie Rosenthal, and two sons, Matthew and Ted, all of New York City.         Correction:  November 27, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, misstated her age. She was 52 years old.       
         Hanya Holm, a major choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 99 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said Heidi Holm, her daughter-in-law.         To theatergoers, Miss Holm was known as the choreographer of musicals including Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Out of This World" and Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot." To modern-dance aficionados, Miss Holm was the most significant choreographer and dancer to have come out of the Central European Expressionist dance tradition in Germany. Its most noted figure was Mary Wigman, and Miss Holm was her student. Her 1937 "Trend," a dance of social protest, is considered a masterwork of American modern dance. Miss Holm has been considered a member of a pantheon of American modern-dance choreographers that included Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman.         A funny, humane and uncompromising woman, Miss Holm encouraged her pupils to find their own individual ways of artistic expression. Her students included leading choreographers as diverse as Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, Glen Tetley, Don Redlich and Lucinda Childs. Sound and Movement         Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes. She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915. The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman. Miss Holm was dancing with Wigman's troupe by 1921 and taught in her school in Dresden. She remained a leading Wigman teacher and dancer for 10 years, creating roles in "Feier" and "Totenmal," which she helped Wigman choreograph. It was during this time that she changed her name.         In 1930-31, Sol Hurok brought the Wigman company to the United States for a transcontinental tour. Hurok had urged Wigman to found an American school, and she agreed, sending Miss Holm to America to direct it. Miss Holm arrived in New York City in September 1931, and for the next five years she devoted herself to teaching. She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance. The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective." The distinction, she added, was "one of 'being' as contrasted with 'doing.' "         Miss Holm took on other teaching positions in important dance institutions, among them, in 1934, the Bennington College Summer School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival, where the "Trend" was first performed. In 1941, she developed the influential summer dance program at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, where she continued to teach until 1983. Part of the success of her teaching lay in her pithy instructions to students. "Keep the beat," she told them, "but undermine it." Another instruction was to "use the feet as if you would pick up a flower with your toes." Her students were familiar with the command to "feel it, children, don't schlep it." 'Living Essence'         She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching. "If I see one more leg extension, I've had it," Miss Holm said in 1984. "There is security in a major leg extension. But it means nothing. The simplest thing is to shun the emotions and emphasize technique. But you become like a nice stove that doesn't give any heat." One had to be careful, she noted, of trying to instill that "little bit of living essence." "You can't take something away without         giving         something," she said.         She had begun choreographing in 1928, but her American concert career began in 1937 with a tour of Midwestern colleges. She made her New York debut that year in a program that included "Trend," her first major work in America, which had a cast of 33 dancers, some of them from her own company and the rest students at Bennington. A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp. Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.         John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering." He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen."         One of the best descriptions of Miss Holm's dances and of "Trend" came, however, in an observation made by the choreographer about Wigman's work. "In her dances she alternately grapples with space as an opponent and caresses it as though it were a living, sentient thing," Miss Holm said. "In her gestures and movement she carves boldly and delicately visible and fluid forms, shaping, surrounding and sinking in the space which presses close about her." Early TV, Then Broadway         Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary. In 1939, she also became the first concert dancer to present her work on television in the United States, showing a shortened version of "Metropolitan Daily," a humorous depiction of a daily newspaper.         Miss Holm had abandoned modern dance for the Broadway stage by 1947, although she continued to create dances for her summer students and choreographed four well-received dances for the Don Redlich Dance Company in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's. Her first success was with the 1948 "Ballet Ballads," a suite of dances she created with Katherine Litz and Paul Godkin to music composed by Jerome Moross, with lyrics by John Latouche.         As a result of the success of her dance, "The Eccentricities of Davy Crockett," Miss Holm was invited to choreograph "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948 and won a New York Drama Critics Award. Over the next 18 years, she created dances for 13 musicals becoming known for her ability to meet the stylistic needs of each show. In 1952, she became the first choreographer to copyright a dance: her choreography for "Kiss Me, Kate," submitted as a written Labanotation score on microfilm.         Among Miss Holm's other Broadway musicals were "Out of This World," "My Darlin' Aida" and "The Golden Apple." She also created the dances for the London and Tel Aviv productions of "My Fair Lady." She choreographed and directed the opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe" in 1956 in Central City, Colo., and Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" for the second annual Vancouver International Festival in 1959. Among her film and television assignments were the dances for the 1955 film version of "The Vagabond King." Miss Holm was also known for her essays, published in periodicals and books, on dance teaching and technique.         Her honors included an award from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for her contributions to modern dance in 1958, the Capezio Award, the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award in 1984 and the Astaire Award in 1987. "It just happened," Miss Holm said of her career in accepting the Scripps Award, "and whatever has happened was with love, dedication, good will, gladly and well. I keep on doing it as good as I can and as long as I can."         Miss Holm's marriage to Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a painter and sculptor, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Klaus, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and three granddaughters, Karen Trautlein of Wilkes-Barre, Angela Holm of San Diego and Jessica Werbin of New Haven, Conn.       
         Catharine A. Yard, president of the American Timber Company, died on Thursday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 48 years old and lived in Sea Girt.         Ms. Yard died of pneumonia, said Michael Cherenson, a family spokesman.         In 1990 Ms. Yard became president of American Timber, which was founded by her grandfather in 1893. Ms. Yard, who attended Yuba College in Marysville, Calif., and Chico State University in Chico, Calif., had worked for the company since 1968.         Ms. Yard is survived by a son, Michael Saito, and three daughters, Michelle, Mikiko and Mary Catherine Saito, and her mother, Dorothy, all of Sea Girt; two sisters, Elizabeth Rasmussen, of Chico, Calif., and Victoria Steiner, of Seattle; four brothers, William, of Modesto, Calif., Carl Jr., of Wall Township, N.J., Richard, of Jackson Township, N.J., and Stephen, of Oroville, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Merline Foster, a health care worker and advocate for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in Boston. She was 46 years old.         She died of complications from hepatitis and AIDS, her family said.         Ms. Foster had said she acquired the diseases in a medical accident involving a broken test tube and needle puncture while drawing blood from a patient at Southwood Hospital in Norfolk, Mass. A suit she filed against the manufacturer of the medical equipment was settled out of court under undisclosed terms.         Ms. Foster campaigned for better safety precautions to protect patients and health care workers and to find a cure and vaccine for AIDS.         Surviving are her daughter, Sherry Quist of Boston; two brothers, James Foster of Westport, Mass., and Russell Foster of Rehobeth, Mass., and a sister, Barbara Marchand of Franklin, Mass.       
         Barbara Kauder Cohen, the author of more than 30 books for children and young adults, died on Sunday at her home in Bridgewater, N.J. She was 60 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Cohen's first book, "The Carp in the Bathtub," was published in 1972 when she was 39 years old. It won acclaim as a modern classic, enough to encourage her to leave her teaching position and devote more of her time to writing.         The book, like many of those that came later, was published by Lothrop and remains in print.         The range of her themes was unusually wide. A 1990 novel, "The Long Way Home," tells of a family coming to terms with cancer. "Molly's Pilgrim" (1983) is the story of a Jewish immigrant girl who enhances the meaning of Thanksgiving for her entire third-grade class; a movie version won an Academy Award in 1986 in the short-subject category.         "Canterbury Tales" (1988) re-creates the flavor of the time and the spirit of Chaucer's words for young readers. Graduated With Honors         A native of Newark, Mrs. Cohen was a 1954 graduate of Barnard College (magna cum laude; Phi Beta Kappa), and earned an M.A. from Rutgers University. She started a teaching career in 1955, in public schools in New Jersey.         She was inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame last year. Four of her books are to be published posthumously.         Mrs. Cohen's husband, Eugene, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughters, Leah Cohen Chatinover of South Windsor, Conn.; Sara Cohen of Kibbutz Ketura, Israel, and Rebecca Cohen Stewart of Bridgewater, N.J.; her mother and stepfather, Florence and Ed Nash of Bridgewater; a brother, Louis Kauder of Alexandria, Va.; a sister, Susan Schwirck of Rahway, N.J.; and three grandchildren.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Allison Assante, a composer and songwriter and supporter of the homeless, died on Friday at her daughter Paula Blasband's home in Manhattan. She was in her early 70's and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack and stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Assante worked for Duke Ellington, and among her better-known compositions were "Goodbye, My Love," "Lonely River" and "Everywhere I Go." She was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and the Songwriters Guild.         Early in her career she studied fashion design, was a model and appeared in Vogue. She became interested in jazz in Chicago during the 1940's.         Long active in behalf of the homeless, she composed and produced a musical, "Heartbeat of the Street," to raise money.         She was also a board member of the Sarah Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem.         Mrs. Assante was born in Lafayette, Ind. Her first marriage ended in divorce. Her husband of 34 years, Mario Assante, a physician, died several years ago.         In addition to her daughter Paula Blasband, she is survived by her daughter Julia Mason of Manhattan; a brother, Arthur Mavity of Indianapolis; two sisters, Marion Greenwald of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Caraway of Watertown, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Clara M. Hale, who nurtured hundreds of abandoned and orphaned babies, the most fragile victims of New York City's epidemics of drug abuse and AIDS, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mother Hale, as she was known, was a pioneer in self-help efforts in poor neighborhoods and came to symbolize the untapped potential of disadvantaged groups taking care of their own. She eventually won international recognition for her efforts, and President Ronald Reagan saluted her as an "American heroine" in his 1985 State of the Union address. Battled Bureaucrats         At times she battled government bureaucrats who resisted her unorthodox methods. But public support helped her gain government grants and persuade officials to bend rules like the requirement that young children be reared in private homes instead of the group care she provided.         She started her work with babies in 1969 in her Harlem home and soon moved the program to a five-story brownstone at 145 West 122d Street. In the early days, the babies slept in cribs next to Mother Hale's bed.         As recently as a few months ago, she kept at least one child in her room, often choosing the neediest one. She expressed frustration when failing health made her too weak to hold a baby. Took in Nearly 1,000 Infants         Aided by donations, a growing staff and volunteers, Hale House took in nearly 1,000 infants, many still trembling from withdrawal pangs after becoming addicted to drugs in the womb.         With nourishment, nurture and play, most of the addicted infants recovered from the effects of fetal drugs and alcohol. But those born infected with the AIDS virus faced a drastically shortened life of suffering that Hale House tried to alleviate.         Her program especially drew attention in the 1980's, when so-called boarder babies languished for months in municipal hospitals, at a cost of several hundred dollars a day for each one. No one else wanted them, and the city's social-services agency was ill-prepared to place them.         "I'm not an American hero -- I'm simply a person who loves children," Mrs. Hale said recently. Explaining her approach to the children, she said: "We hold them and touch them. They love you to tell them how great they are, how good they are. Somehow, even at a young age, they understand that. They're happy, and they turn out well."         She said she expected to keep caring for children "until I die."         Hale House's policy is to reunite children with their families after the parents recover from their addiction, and it says it has been able to do so with about 90 percent of the children. Some children remained exceptionally close to Mother Hale, who considered them part of her own family.         Mrs. Hale's philosophy and mission were rooted in the travails of her own life.         She grew up in Philadelphia. Her father was murdered when she was a child, and her mother took in boarders and ran a lunchroom for longshoremen. Mrs. Hale credited her mother -- who died when she was just 16 -- with instilling the values on which Hale House is based.         After high school, she married Thomas Hale. They moved to New York, where he ran a floor-waxing service and studied business administration in night classes at City College. Mrs. Hale worked as a domestic and cleaned Loews theaters. Left to Rear 3 Children         Her husband died of cancer when she was 27, leaving her to rear three children, Nathan, Lorraine and Kenneth. At first she cleaned homes by day and theaters by night.         But then, reluctant to leave her youngsters, she started taking in other children for $2 a week and eventually became a licensed foster parent. She took in seven or eight children at a time. Eventually she reared 40 foster children, keeping them out of trouble and steering them from the temptations and dangers of the street. She emphasized reading and good behavior, and frequently treated them to trips to museums and other outings.         All made it through high school and many went to college, and they rewarded Mrs. Hale with 60 children of their own whom she regarded as her grandchildren.         The next phase of Mrs. Hale's life started in 1969, by chance. Her daughter, Lorraine, was driving on 146th Street when she was distressed to see a drug-addicted woman on a crate nodding off with her 2-month-old baby slipping out of her arms. 'She Says You Sent Her'         Impulsively, Miss Hale stopped, got out and admonished the woman to seek drug treatment and temporarily leave the baby with Mrs. Hale -- then 63 years old and retired.         The next morning, they later recalled, Mother Hale telephoned Lorraine to say, "There's a junkie at my door, and she says you sent her." Lorraine confirmed that she had, and Mrs. Hale took the baby. Word spread, and soon a steady stream of babies were placed with her.         Lorraine Hale went on to earn doctorates in developmental psychology and child development. In the mid-1980's, she became the executive director of Hale House and later its president. She plans to continue operating Hale House and its growing programs at other sites.         Hale House was renovated in 1975 with aid from Percy E. Sutton, then the Manhattan Borough President, with nurseries, a central kitchen and dining room, a playground, and many mirrors, placed at a toddler's eye level.         Throughout the Beame and Koch administrations, Hale House won waivers from state regulations barring group nurseries for children under the age of 5. But in 1989, saying that the crack epidemic had crested and the city was doing better in finding foster homes for children, the Dinkins administration stopped referring children to Hale House. Increased Fund-Raising         Mrs. Hale refused to give up. The flow of children continued, brought to Hale House by desperate parents, police officers, churches and other groups. To finance their care without government money, Hale House increased its private fund-raising.         Its budget last year was $3.5 million, and Hale House has been championed over the years by celebrities like Lena Horne, John Lennon and Tony Bennett.         In the last two years, Hale House has expanded its programs. They include housing and educating mothers after detoxification; apprentice training for youths who start to stray, and a home for mothers and infants infected with the AIDS virus. The organization also hopes to create Hale Haven, a larger version of the original Hale House, which will continue to house infants.         In addition to her daughter, Lorraine, Mrs. Hale's survivors include two sons, Nathan and Kenneth, and several grandchildren.         A service will be held at noon on Wednesday at the Riverside Church on Riverside Drive at 122d Street in Manhattan, with viewing from 9 to 11:20 A.M.       
         Marilyn Neufeld Bergner, a professor and researcher who helped to develop a widely used system for evaluating the medical condition of patients, died Dec. 12 at her home in Silver Spring, Md.. She was 59.         She died of ovarian cancer, her family said.         Since 1986, Dr. Bergner was a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.         In her prior teaching post at the University of Washington School of Public Health from 1972 to 1986, she was on the team that developed the Sickness Impact Profile. It measures the patient's level of functioning and monitors the progress during the course of an illness, based on periodic questionnaires filled out by the patient. The form is now widely used around the world.         Dr. Bergner was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. After earning a doctorate in socio-medical science at Columbia University in 1970, she served two years as an assistant to the first vice president at New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation.         Surviving are her husband of 39 years, Dr. Lawrence Bergner, a physician; her mother, Clara Neufeld of Brooklyn; two sons, Daniel of Manhattan, and Robert of Montreal, and a granddaughter.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Several thousand friends, admirers and family members filled Riverside Church yesterday to celebrate the life and to mourn the death of Clara M. Hale, the woman who sheltered and raised hundreds of abandoned and orphaned children in her home.         The service, an afternoon of heart-felt tributes, seemed to offer solace to those who were most touched by her example. Mother Hale, as she was widely known, died last Friday of complications from a stroke. She was 87 years old.         "Our lady of inner-city royalty," was the title given her by Percy E. Sutton, the businessman and former Manhattan Borough President, who in 1975 helped Mrs. Hale find and renovate a Harlem brownstone on West 122d Street which became Hale House, only a half-dozen blocks from Riverside Church. His description prompted a string of "amens" that rippled through the listeners.         Standing amid the seasonal red and green of bright poinsettias and fragrant Christmas pines, Mr. Sutton and others recalled Mrs. Hale's capacity for loving each of her children, for placing mirrors at toddler's eye level in Hale House, for taking the frailest of babies into her own room overnight. 'We're Almost Home'         A noonday mist dampened the gray stone on the outside walls of the church facing the Hudson River along Riverside Drive, but inside, song from the lips of the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Gospel Choir seemed to reach up toward the rich blue of the church's stained glass windows.         "We're almost home," sang the 30-member choir, many of whom came of age, and mind, at Hale House. They swayed back and forth in red and yellow robes as they sang: "I'm so tired and weary, no more do I want to roam."         The service, which lasted 100 minutes, opened with a procession of so many politicians, community leaders and members of Mrs. Hale's extended family that it took more than 10 minutes for them just to file in and be seated. Mayor David N. Dinkins, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Yoko Ono were among those in the procession.         A coffin of light-colored poplar was wheeled to the front of the church during the service. Afterward, it was guarded by a detail of the Harlem Youth Marine Cadets outside before it was taken for burial. Mrs. Hale's family asked that the location be kept private.         "Woe to those who thought this woman old and frail," said Mayor Dinkins, who was greeted by a standing ovation when he went to the pulpit. "She had twice the stamina of most others.         "The best tribute we can give is to keep her legacy alive," he added, saying that efforts would be made to fulfill Mrs. Hale's wish to establish a hospice for dying children at Hale House. Quoting the poet Langston Hughes, he concluded: "Beautiful also are the souls of my people. Mother, may you rest in peace." 'Like She Knew'         Mr. Sutton recalled his fondest memory of Mrs. Hale, which was when she rose to acknowledge the applause she received from Congress in 1985, after being cited as a "true American hero" in a State of the Union address by President Ronald Reagan.         "She rose gently, with the smile she always gave, like she knew that she owned everything," Mr. Sutton said. He described her reluctance at first to appear with Mr. Reagan because the President, as Mr. Sutton put it, "was not being too kind to people in the neighborhood where she lived." She resisted the invitation with the excuse that she was ill, but after the White House insisted that her daughter, Lorraine, appear in her place, Mrs. Hale eventually gave in.         Among the day's speakers was the Rev. Carolyn Knight, Mrs. Hale's pastor at the Philadelphia Baptist Church.         "She touched children no one else would touch," Ms. Knight said. "She showed us that what children really need is a hug and a kiss and a smile.         "In this season, when much is spoken of angels sent from God, Mother Hale was an angel," she said.         Ms. Knight recalled speaking with Mrs. Hale in a quiet moment about a year ago.         "She said: 'Carolyn, do you believe God knows my way? Do you believe I will go to heaven when I die ?' "         Ms. Knight closed the service with a final goodbye, provoking tears in the eyes of many listeners: "Farewell, farewell, you gentle lovely lady, we shall meet again."       
         Helen Joseph, a white dissident who was repeatedly detained and harassed by the South African Government in a long struggle against apartheid, died today in a hospital here. She was 87.         She died of complications from a stroke she had suffered two weeks ago, news agencies reported.         Mrs. Joseph became prominent here as a symbol of white opposition to the racial policies of her adopted land in the years after World War II when apartheid gained legal force. In this way, she was ahead of most other white foes of the system of racial separation.         The Government responded in kind, for more than three decades placing the often-ailing, ever-defiant Mrs. Joseph under various forms of house arrest and issuing banning orders that prohibited her from receiving more than one visitor at a time.         She was also declared a "listed person," a punishment intended to prevent her from being quoted in any form.         Even when formally silenced, she never accepted the restrictions, imposed under the Suppression of Communism Act. "You can't silence yourself," she once told an interviewer.         In the ranks of anti-apartheid campaigners, Mrs. Joseph was a militant, an associate of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, who once referred to her as part of their "family." From Polite Background         It was not a role that her upbringing might have suggested. Born in Sussex in England in 1905, Helen Beatrice May Fennell seemed set for a middle-class English life. She graduated with an honors degree from the University of London in 1927 and went on to teach for three years in India.         Arriving in South Africa in 1931, she settled in Durban, married a dentist, and "threw herself into the life style of a socialite," as The Weekly Mail of Johannesburg said in 1986. "In those days," the profile of her added, "she was known as beautiful and flighty, leading a life of wining and dining and bridge parties."         Friends say her service as an information and welfare officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in World War II and a subsequent decision to become a social worker in Cape Town and Johannesburg exposed her to some of the realities of South Africa.         Divorced in 1948, she became a founder of the Congress of Democrats, the white wing of the African National Congress. In 1955, she was present for the adoption of the congress's Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a South Africa without racial discrimination.         The following year, Mrs. Joseph helped lead a march of 20,000 women on the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest the extension of laws requiring blacks to carry passes. She was arrested and charged with treason, and a year later was put under the first of a series of banning orders. Overcame Cancer         In 1961, Mrs. Joseph was acquitted of treason after a marathon trial. But from 1962 to 1971, as a banned person, she was not allowed to receive visitors on weekends or at night, or to socialize with more than one person at a time. The order was lifted when she entered a hospital for cancer treatment.         "I had a cancer operation and then I had a major heart attack," she told an interviewer, "and they must really have thought, 'This old girl can't go on much longer.' "         But she did go on, campaigning at English-language universities. In 1978, she was jailed again, this time for contempt after she refused to testify against Winnie Mandela.         In August 1983, she became a sponsor of the United Democratic Front, which orchestrated the protest campaign of the mid-80's on behalf of the still-outlawed African National Congress. The campaign led to international sanctions against South Africa and ultimately to President F. W. de Klerk's offer of political change and to Mr. Mandela's release in 1990.         By then some reforms had begun, including the lifting of racial restrictions in public places. It seemed that Mrs. Joseph had outlasted a legal system that persecuted her. But her age and health problems, like a painful infirmity from leg fractures, confined to a wheelchair. She was no longer strong enough to speak at rallies.         Nonetheless, when Mr. de Klerk conducted a referendum in March, seeking approval to continue talks toward nonracial democracy, Mrs. Joseph appeared in public to tell supporters that she was voting for changes she had sought for more than four decades.       
         Dr. Helene Wallace Toolan, a cancer researcher, died on Sunday at Southwestern Vermont Hospital Center in Bennington. She was 80 years old and lived in Old Bennington, Vt.         She died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her family said.         Dr. Toolan, a native of Chicago, graduated with honors from the University of Chicago at the age of 17 and received a Ph.D. in pathology from Cornell Medical Center. She was on the staff of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York from 1950 until 1964.         Dr. Toolan did basic research on the transplantation of human tumors and tissues into laboratory animals. In 1955 she received the Sloan Award for her work. Linked Cancers to Virus         She also studied the relationship between viruses and human cancer cells, leading a team of researchers that succeeded in linking viruses to eight types of human cancer in 1960. Previously only leukemia, a cancer affecting the blood, had been linked to a virus.         In 1964 Dr. Toolan moved to Bennington to direct the newly established Putnam Memorial Institute for Medical Research. In 1987 the institute was renamed the Helene W. Toolan Institute for Medical Research. She became director emeritus and senior scientist of the institute in 1978 and director emeritus and trustee in 1985.         Dr. Toolan was also an avid gardener, horticulturist and ornithologist, and participated in a project to beautify downtown Bennington in the early 1970's. The Garden Club of America gave her its Horticulural Award in 1982.         Her first husband, Dr. Edward Wallace, died in 1943. She later married Dr. James M. Toolan, who survives her. Also surviving are two sons, Robin Wallace of Gainesville, Fla., and Alan Wallace of Las Vegas, Nev.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Boyle, a short-story writer and novelist renowned for her deft and powerful style and her keen insights into human nature, died on Sunday night at the Redwoods, a retirement community in Mill Valley, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived at the Redwoods, where she had moved from San Francisco several years ago.         She had been in declining health for a year, said her son, Ian von Franckenstein of Kentland, Calif.         Miss Boyle wrote four dozen books, including many works of fiction, seven books of poetry and four books for children. But it was for her short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, Harper's and elsewhere, that she was particularly acclaimed. Some critics have called "The White Horses of Vienna" (1936) an especially fine collection of her stories.         She won two O. Henry Memorial Awards for short-story writing, one for the title story of that 1936 collection and one for "Defeat" in 1941. She also won a Guggenhiem Fellowship in 1934. The Lady as Radical         The writer Stephen Vincent Benet once described Miss Boyle's style as being "as bright as an icicle and light as the bones of a bird." And the critic Louis Kronenberger once contended that the fineness of her insights was "such as no other writer of our time, in English at least, can match."         Her work, which also included essays and translations, commanded admiration from critics for more than half a century. It was colored by years of living in different parts of Europe -- she moved to Brittany in 1923, then lived in Paris and elsewhere -- and by social and political concerns. Her 1936 novel "Death of a Man" contained material from her life in Austria in the mid-1930's.         Late in her life, Miss Boyle wrote that she saw herself "as a dangerous 'radical' cleverly disguised as a perfect lady." She reported that she could not remember a time beyond the age of 6 when she had not been committed in favor of, or opposed to, something. Her activities ranged from helping the families of conscientious objectors in World War I to supporting human-rights causes and demonstrating against United States involvement in Vietnam. But she also had passionate and abiding literary concerns.         Reviewing a 1988 collection of her short stories, "Life Being the Best & Other Stories," edited by Sandra Whipple (New Directions), Ann Hornaday wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book celebrated her "enduring artistic discipline.' At Home in Europe         "Unlike some of her better-known peers," Ms. Hornaday wrote, Miss Boyle "survived the halcyon days of Paris in the 1920's," and although she "is not as notorious as some of the other Moderns -- those intrepid expatriate writers who set out to change language, mesh literature and social context and expose the dissonance of contemporary life -- she evokes these tensions with a gossamer fineness."         Miss Boyle was born in St. Paul on Feb. 19, 1902, the daughter of Howard P. Boyle and the former Katharine Evans. She spent much of her childhood in Europe and then returned to the United States, where she attended school in Washington for a time.         After financial problems, the family moved to Cincinnati. Miss Boyle took violin lessons at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and attended the Ohio Mechanics Institute from 1917 to 1919, intending to go into architecture.         With her first husband, Richard Brault, a French engineer whom she had met in Cincinnati and married in 1923, Miss Boyle briefly lived in New York City, where she attended Columbia University. The couple then went to Europe, where Miss Boyle stayed for almost 20 years, living in England as well as France and Austria, and taking a fellow American expatriate, Laurence Vail, as her second husband in 1931 after she was divorced from her first.         In that period, she looked more kindly on Europeans than on her compatriots and on many of her fellow female writers. "I like to be with people who work -- English, French, or any foreign working people," she wrote, but "I am ill at ease with Americans."         She observed that most women "do not write simply or violently enough for my taste." She added, "I should like my prose to be lucid, direct and lean." A Poet in Later Years         Miss Boyle and Mr. Vail returned to the United States in 1941. They later divorced, and in 1943 she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein.After World War II she was a correspondent in Europe for The New Yorker for a time. She went on to become a professor of English and creative writing at San Francisco State University from 1963 to 1979.         Her son said her last new book to be published was was "Words That Must Somehow Be Said: Selected Essays of Kay Boyle" (North Point Press, 1985).         Reviewing "50 Stories," a collection of her work published in 1980, Vance Bourjaily wrote in The New York Times that the stories included such techniques as "literary simplification, rhythmic repetition, the mixing in of vernacular, stream of consciousness, density of impressions, radical imagery and experiments with surrealism." The collection was republished this year by New Directions Books.         Mr. Von Franckenstein said Miss Boyle had continued to write and that most of her recent work was poetry, some of which had been published.         In addition to her son, an actor whose stage name is Ian Swift, she is survived by a sister, Joan Detweiler of Sarasota, Fla.; four daughters, Sharon Cowling of Vezenobres, France; Kathe Vail, who lives outside Paris; Clover Vail of New York City, and Faith Gude of Boston; 17 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jennie Resnick Bernstein, the mother of Leonard Bernstein, who contributed lyrics for a segment of his last musical work, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 94 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.         The family said she died after a stroke.         Mrs. Bernstein collaborated with her son on "Arias and Barcarolles," a song cycle that received a Grammy Award in 1991 for best contemporary composition.         Leonard Bernstein died in 1990. Mrs. Bernstein's husband, Samuel, died in 1969.         Mrs. Bernstein is survived by a daughter, Shirley Anne Bernstein of New York, a son, Burton Bernstein of Bridgewater, Conn., and five grandchildren.       
         Fannie Bear Besser, who at the age of 20 became one of New Jersey's first female lawyers and did legal work until she was 90, died on Friday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, N.J. She was 92 years old and lived in East Orange, N.J.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Besser, who grew up in Newark, went directly from high school to the New Jersey Law School, now a part of Rutgers University. She enrolled there because it was the only school where she could attend night classes while working days, as a secretary.         She graduated first in her class, at age 20. Because she was under 21, she had to receive special permission from the state's chief justice to take the bar examination.         After practicing general law for four years, she left her career to have her children and rear them.         In the late 1930's she returned to legal work as a volunteer lawyer for various agencies: the New Jersey Board of Mediation, the Army's Legal Department, the Governor's Commission for Refugees after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Governor's Landlord-Tenant Committee in the 1960's.         In 1968 she became a full-time volunteer lawyer at the Essex-Newark Legal Services in Orange. There she advised and represented elderly people until her health failed 18 months ago.         Her work was honored by two Army commendations, a New Jersey State Bar award in 1986 and Governor Thomas Kean's Humanitarian of the Year Award in 1989. In 1990, the Rutgers Law School Alumni Association created the Fannie Bear Besser award for public service. She was the first recipient.         She was married for 56 years to Hyman Besser, who founded an accounting firm in Newark. He died 14 years ago.         Surviving are her son, Albert G., of South Orange; two daughters, Edith Segall of Harrison, N.Y., and Ann Scott of Windsor, Maine; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 11, 1992, Friday         An obituary on Sunday about one of the first female lawyers in New Jersey rendered her last name incorrectly in some editions. She was Fannie Bear Besser.
