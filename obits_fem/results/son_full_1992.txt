         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.         Then she returned to the university's law school, becoming its third female graduate. She worked in her father's firm, then married Reuben Oscar Everett and worked with him.

         Shirley Berman, whose daughter, born with Down Syndrome, inspired her to wage a battle for a New Jersey law requiring doctors to inform parents if their unborn child is retarded, died on Feb. 8 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 55 years old and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Berman, a social worker, began a legal battle after her daughter Sharon, now 17, was born with Down Syndrome. Mrs. Berman contended that her doctor failed to tell her she risked having a retarded child and that the fetus could have been tested for the condition.         In 1979, the New Jersey State Supreme Court ruled that doctors could be sued for "wrongful birth" if their negligence deprived a mother of her right to an abortion and a child was born with defects.         Mrs. Berman worked for the Westchester Association for Retarded Children. A native of Montreal, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree from McGill University in Canada, a master's in art therapy in 1981 from the College of New Rochelle and a master's in social work from Fordham University in 1988.         She is survived by her husband, Paul; two daughters, Sharon, at home, and Deborah, of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Jonathan, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Minnie Segal of Montreal, and two brothers, Bernard and Henry Segal, both of Montreal.       
         Angela Carter, a novelist and short-story writer, died at her home in London on Sunday. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for Farrar, Straus & Giroux, her publisher in New York.         Ms. Carter's work was widely praised in Britain, although less widely known in the United States. She was the author of more than a half-dozen macabre novels and a polemical study of the Marquis de Sade, "The Sadeian Woman."         Her novels included "The Magic Toyshop," "Several Perceptions" and "Nights of the Circus." A number of her works were regarded as fairy tales with modern morals. Wrote for Radio and Films         British critics often described Ms. Carter's writing style as "magic realism," but she believed the label was not quite accurate. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, she said: "It's more realism than not. I can't define it until after it's done except that it is definitely fiction. It's more in the genre of Latin American writers like Garcia Marquez and Borges."         Whatever the label, Ms. Carter's interest in fantasies, fairy tales and dreams was lifelong. She wrote radio scripts, short stories, children's books and screenplays, one of which became the 1984 film "The Company of Wolves." Her 1991 novel, "Wise Children," was about the illegitimate twin daughters of a celebrated Shakespearean actor.         Ms. Carter was born in 1940 in Eastbourne. She began her writing career as a journalist on a South London weekly, The Croydon Advertiser. Later, she studied English literature at the University of Bristol, then began to write cultural criticism for New Society, The New Statesman and other publications.         From 1976 to 1978, Ms. Carter was a fellow in creative writing at Sheffield University in England, and in 1980 and 1981 she was a visiting professor in the writing program at Brown University in Providence, R.I. She also taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.         She is survived by her husband, Mark Pearce, and a son, Alexander.       
         Susan Kaplan Hopwood, a marketing and sales executive in New York City, died on Feb. 8 at her home in Newtonville, Mass. She was 55 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, her family said.         Mrs. Hopwood was advertising sales manager of Barron's, the business weekly, in the 1970's. Advertising lineage doubled in three years under her direction, and she helped initiate the overseas distribution for the publication. Moving to the parent of Barron's, Dow Jones & Company, she helped start "The Wall Street Journal Report" programs on radio and television.         From 1982 to 1988 she headed public relations for Advertising Age magazine. She ran its annual creative workshop, attracting marketing and advertising agencies from 47 countries, and helped institute annual awards for the best television commercials.         She also helped the International Advertising Association organize its annual conferences from 1986 to 1989, including its first gathering in Beijing. Recently she worked on marketing for the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Art News magazine and World Paper, an international news supplement for other publications.

         Isabelle Siegel, a sculptor, died on Tuesday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 49 years old.         She took her own life, her family said.         Between 1984 and 1990, Ms. Siegel had three one-person shows at the Kraushaar Galleries in New York City. She also had shows at the Pace Gallery in New York and at other galleries in the United States and in Brazil and Peru.         She was born in New York and received a bachelor's degree at Sarah Lawrence College; she also studied at Columbia University, the Art Students League, the Delehanty Institute and the Escola de Artes Visuals in Rio de Janeiro.         She is survived by a son, Justin Greene of New York; two brothers, Martin and William Paul Siegel of Fort Worth, and a sister, Caryl Stern of New York.       
         Frances Young Tang, a philanthropist in the field of education and a preservationist specializing in landmark buildings, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old and also had homes in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Vail, Colo.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Oscar L. Tang.         The beneficiaries of Mrs. Tang's philanthropy included the Department of East Asian Studies at Duke University, the Chinese language program at Skidmore College and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. She was a trustee of Phillips Academy at the time of her death and had been on the executive committee of the school's development board.         She was also president of Vencura Ltd., a Manhattan-based company that rehabilitates landmark buildings and has been doing work in Vail, Colo. She had also managed a Chinese catering business.         Mrs. Tang was born in Paris, the daughter of Kuangson Young, a Nationalist Chinese career diplomat who was executed during World War II by the Japanese in the Philippines. She came to the United States on an American troop ship and grew up in Manhattan.  She graduated in 1957 from Abbot Academy in Andover, Mass., which later merged with Phillips Academy, and in 1961 from Skidmore College.         She was married in 1960 to Mr. Tang, who is the president of Reich & Tang, a financial services firm with headquarters in Manhattan.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Juliana Koo of Manhattan, who is the widow of V. K. Wellington Koo, a Nationalist Chinese diplomat who was an ambassador to Washington and a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague; three daughters, Tracy Tang Limpe, Dana and Kristin, all of Manhattan; a son, Kevin, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Genevieve Young of Manhattan and Shirley Young of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Manhattan.       
         Dr. Gloria Friedman Franklin, a psychoanalyst and faculty member of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. Girard Franklin, also a psychoanalyst.         Dr. Friedman, as she was known professionally, felt it important not to hide her illness because of the effect on therapy, her husband said. When she assumed the presidency of the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society in May 1990, she gave an address titled, "Impact of a Therapist's Life -- Threatening Illness on the Therapeutic Situation." The address was published last year by the magazine Contemporary Psychoanalysis.         At the time of her death, Dr. Friedman was a training and supervising analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan besides being a member of the faculty. She was to start teaching a course on women's issues in psychoanalysis next week.         She was also a training and supervising analyst at the Institute for Psychotherapy, an attending psychologist at Roosevelt Hospital and a lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University.         She was particularly known for her work on mother-daughter relationships. In a study on raising children in The New York Times Magazine in March 1985, Dr. Friedman was quoted as saying: "The cultural expectations will always be more powerful than any biological differences. From day one, a mother treats a boy baby differently from a girl baby. Cultural imprinting is so subtle that we can't help ourselves. But it's not a bad thing. We're raising them for the culture they have to live in."         Born and raised a New Yorker, Dr. Friedman graduated from New York University, from which she also received a Ph.D. She earned a master's degree in psychology from City College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Gary, of San Francisco, and two daughters, Lisa, of Philadelphia, and Eve Lynes, of San Mateo, Calif.       
         Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn, a leading fashion model in the 1940's and 50's, died Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Huntington L.I.         She died of pneumonia, a family representative said.         An elegant blonde, the Swedish-born model posed for some of the most famous photographers of the age, including Horst P. Horst, George Hoyningen Huene and Irving Penn, whom she married in 1950. In the late 1940's, when most models were paid $10 to $25 an hour, she was earning $40 an hour. When most models's careers ended before their 30th birthdays, hers flourished until she was past 40.         She was a frequent subject of Penn's photographs for Vogue magazine, particularly his studies of French haute couture. Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of Conde Nast Publications, which publishes Vogue, said the Penns represented "an extraordinary relationship between a photographer and a model."         "She was the inspiration and subject of some of Penn's greatest photographs," Mr. Liberman said yesterday. "She epitomized a very noble period of fashion and couture. She gave a classical dignity to anything she wore." 'A Good Clothes Hanger'         Lisa Fonssagrives had a more down-to-earth attitude to her contributions as a model. She was quoted in a 1949 article in Time magazine as saying: "It is always the dress, it is never, never the girl. I'm just a good clothes hanger."         In addition to modeling, she also pursued careers as a ballet dancer, a photographer, a fashion designer and a sculptor.         She was born in Uddevalla, Sweden. Her father, a dentist who also painted, changed the family name from Anderson, which he considered too commonplace, to Bernstone. Her mother made clothes and encouraged Lisa to study art and ballet.         Lisa Bernstone went to Paris to pursue a dancing career. She met and married Fernand Fonssagrives, a dancer, there in 1935. Photographs Led to Modeling         A year later, Horst took some photographs of her that led to a modeling career. Pictures of her appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1939, she worked both as a model and as a photographer.         She continued both careers after her divorce and subsequent marriage to Penn. After she stopped modeling in the mid-50's, she designed clothes for about six years, at one point doing a collection of leisure wear for Lord & Taylor.         In the 1960's, she devoted her time to sculpturing, working in marble, bronze and fiberglass. She was represented by the Marlborough Gallery.         A book on her work as a model is scheduled for publication later this year in Germany.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer, and a son, Tom Penn, a metal designer, both of New York City; by two sisters, Lilian Bernstone and Kajsa Lundquist, both of Sweden, and by two grandchildren.       
         Rose Korn Hirschman, a real-estate lawyer and volunteer at the United Nations and other organizations, died Jan. 24 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver failure, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up there and in Brooklyn. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at New York University. She began practicing law in Manhattan with her brother, Ashton Korn, and after his death worked on her own.         For nine years she represented the International Federation of Women Lawyers at United Nations commissions dealing with discrimination, minorities, women, economics, crime, commodities trade, human rights and population growth.         She was a past president of the Sisterhood of the Community Synagogue, vice president of the Congregation Emanuel Sisterhood and chairwoman of its youth activities and board member of the Young Women's Hebrew Association. She headed the Mount Vernon branch of the American Red Cross and served on the board of its Westchester County chapter. She was also on the boards of the Mount Vernon Nursing School and Mount Vernon Hospital and founded the hospital's volunteer services.         Her husband, Dr. Sol Hirschman, is dead. She is survived by two daughters, Judge Aileen Hirschman Belford of Fall River, Mass., and E. Judith Hirschman Berger of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Richard James Hirschman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Emilia Sherman Maurer, who put the Rockettes through their paces from the gala opening of Radio City Music Hall on Dec. 27, 1932, until she retired as director of the dancers more than 40 years later, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett, L.I. She lived in Point Lookout, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Miss Sherman, who used her maiden name professionally, had kept her age a secret and left "explicit instructions" that it remain so, her son said. She died after a long illness, he said.         A close associate of Russell E. Markert, who founded the Rockettes in 1926, Miss Sherman choreographed many of the young dancers' routines. These included signature tap routines as well as her specialty, dance presentations she developed from the folk dances of many nations.         When Mr. Markert moved his troupe to Rockefeller Center in 1932, Miss Sherman became its captain as well as a dancer in the chorus line. She drilled the other dancers, showed them their steps and movements and kept them in line.         She quickly became a principal aide to Mr. Markert and, for more than 15 years, was his associate director. She became director upon his retirement in 1971. She retired in 1973.         Miss Sherman, a native of New York City, attended Professional Children's School here and later studied ballet and flamenco dancing. She made her vaudeville debut at the age of 6 and first went on a Broadway stage when she was 12 years old.         She learned her first tap steps from another dancer in Shubert Alley minutes before an audition, winning a job as a specialty act. From then on, she was known for her ability to pick up steps quickly and create new ones on her own.         This led her to choreography as a career. At Radio City, this entailed conjuring up a new spectacle with every change in the movie program, about once a month. Miss Sherman also played den mother and sergeant major to the 46 precision dancers in the troupe, any 36 of whom kicked off four times daily in a wheeling straight line nearly a city block long. In addition, she rehearsed the dancers four hours a week.         Miss Sherman is survived by her husband of 56 years, Henry S. Maurer; their son, Henry S. Jr., of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a daughter, Arnelle Liblit of Commack, L.I., and one grandson.       
         Holly Stevens, an editor who devoted much of her career to writing about and editing the work of her father, the poet Wallace Stevens, died on Wednesday at her home in Guilford, Conn. She was 67 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Ruth Hein, a friend.         Ms. Stevens's edition of "The Letters of Wallace Stevens" appeared in 1966. Her selection of work from her father's journals in a 1977 book called "Souvenirs and Prophecies: The Young Wallace Stevens" became controversial. The work was praised by Helen Vendler, writing in The New York Times Book Review, for giving a complete portrait of the poet as a young man "so that the journal fragments and first poems can be placed in the context of Stevens's character and life."         But Anatole Broyard, reviewing the book for the daily edition of The New York Times, declared that it did a "disservice" to one of his favorite poets. The book, he said, offered "no intimations whatever of Stevens's ultimate achievement: one year he was writing vapid and sentimental mediocrities, and the next he was turning out one of the best poems of our century."         She was married to John Martin Hanchak and later to Duncan Stephenson. Both marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Peter Reed Hanchak of Philadelphia, and two grandchildren.       
         Leueen MacGrath, an actress and playwright who co-wrote the 1955 Broadway musical "Silk Stockings" with her third husband, George S. Kaufman, died on Friday at her home in London. She was 77 years old.         Her stepdaughter, Anne Kaufman Schneider, said Miss MacGrath died after complications of a stroke last November.         As a playwright, Miss MacGrath collaborated on three Broadway shows with Mr. Kaufman while they were married: "The Small Hours" (1951), "Fancy Meeting You Again" (1952) and "Silk Stockings," a lampoon of life in the Soviet Union that starred Don Ameche and Hildegarde Neff. The show had music and lyrics by Cole Porter and a book by Mr. Kaufman, Miss MacGrath and Abe Burrows.         Miss MacGrath (her name was pronunced lew-EEN mac-GRAW) made her Broadway debut in 1948 in a starring role in "Edward, My Son," by Robert Morley and Noel Langley, after first performing in the play in London. She was also cast in the 1949 Hollywood movie version of the play starring Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr.         Miss MacGrath's many other New York successes included roles in "The Enchanted" (1950), "The Potting Shed" (1957), "The Love of Four Colonels" (1959), "Farewell, Farewell Eugene" (1960), "Ghosts" (1961) and "A Tribute to Lili Lamont" (1976).         Her screen credits also included "Pygmalion" and "Three Cases of Murder."         In 1976, when Miss MacGrath appeared as the grand actress Irina Arkadina in Chekhov's "Seagull" at the Manhattan Theater Club, Clive Barnes, writing in The New York Times, said her work was "one of the best individual performances on view anywhere in New York at present."         Miss MacGrath's final London appearances were in "Voyage Round My Father," opposite Alec Guinness, in 1966, and in "A Bequest to the Nation," with Zoe Caldwell, in 1970.         Miss MacGrath was born on July 3, 1914, in London. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, she made her debut in a West End production of "Beggars in Hell." During World War II she performed for the troops in an acting unit with Emlyn Williams.         She was married and divorced five times. Her husbands were Christopher Burn, Desmond Davis, Mr. Kaufman, Stephen Goodyear and Stephen Quinto.         She is survived by a sister, Eila Phillips, who lives in England, and Ms. Schneider, of New York City.       
         Mary Osborne, one of the few women to gain jazz stardom as a guitarist and the first woman to play the electric guitar professionally, died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70 years old.         She died of liver failure as a result of cancer, said her son Ralph Scaffidi Jr.         Both her parents were guitarists, and Ms. Osborne -- whose family name was Orsborn -- became fascinated by stringed instruments as a child. She began playing the ukulele when she was 4 and at 10 she joined a string band led by her father in which she played banjo. She had started playing guitar a year earlier, and while she was in grammar school she was playing jazz violin. 'The Most Startling Thing'         She sang and played guitar in her hometown, Bismarck, N.D., in her teen-age years. When she was 17 some fellow musicians urged her to hear the Al Trent Sextet, which was playing a one-night stand in Bismark. One musician played an instrument she had never seen or heard before: an electric guitar. The guitarist was Charlie Christian.         "The only electric guitar I knew of was the Hawaiian guitar," she said. "I'd listen to all the jazz guitarists of the time, but they all played acoustic. But here was Charlie Christian playing Django Reinhardt's 'St. Louis Blues' note for note but with an electric guitar. It was the most startling thing I'd ever heard."         The next day, she found a guitar like Christian's. It cost $85; for $45, a friend built an amplifier for her. From then on, she was an electric guitarist.         She went on the road with an all-female trio. When they played St. Louis, Buddy Rogers, the movie star-turned-band leader, heard them and added them to his band. The Rogers band broke up when it reached New York, but Ms. Osborne quickly got jobs at radio stations and recording studios and joined in jam sessions in clubs on West 52d Street. She eventually formed her own trio.         With her husband, Ralph Scaffidi, a trumpet player, she moved to Bakersfield in 1968 where they formed and ran the Osborne Guitar Company, which later became the Osborne Sound Laboratories, a manufacturer of amplifiers and public-address systems. She appeared at the Kool Jazz Festival in New York in 1981 and played at the Village Vanguard two years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Bakersfield, she is survived by her husband, another son, Peter, of Clovis, N.M.; a daughter, Susan Chidgey of Bakersfield; a brother, Elvy Orsborn, and a sister, Louise Orsborn.       
         La Lupe, a singer who was known during the late 1960's as the Queen of Latin Soul, died on Feb. 28 at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She was 53 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said.         La Lupe had a raspy voice and an uninhibited stage presence; she shook her long hair, shimmied in low-cut dresses and tossed her beads and shoes to the crowds. A string of hits she made with the bandleader Tito Puente in the mid-1960's established her as one of the most popular performers in Latin music.         La Lupe was born Lupe Victoria Yoli in Santiago, a village in Oriente Province in Cuba. At her parents' insistence, she earned a teaching degree, but she had also been winning local singing contests, and decided to go into performing. She married a singer in the trio Los Tropicuba; after her first performance, he said he thought she was having an epileptic fit. She soon divorced him and began working on her own, and by 1960 she was a leading performer in Havana nightclubs. She bought her own club, but after difficulties with the Fidel Castro Government -- "Castro take my club, my money, my car," she told Look magazine in 1971 -- she emigrated to the United States, and settled in New York in 1962. The Making of a Star         Soon after she arrived, she began singing with orchestras led by Mongo Santamaria and Mr. Puente, with whom she recorded a number of hit singles, including "Que Te Pedi." By the end of the 1960's, she was a star in her own right, working with Mr. Puente and with other bandleaders, and touring the United States and Latin America.         In the mid-1970's, her jobs in New York City dwindled, and she moved to Puerto Rico, where she played concerts and television programs. She returned to New York, but her career had declined and her second husband's medical expenses depleted her savings. By the early 1980's she was living on welfare. In 1984, while hanging a curtain, she fell, injured her spine and was paralyzed; not long afterward, an electrical fire burned down her house. She sang with Mr. Puente for the last time in 1985, from a wheelchair, at a concert to help pay her expenses.         According to Vernon Boggs's "Salsiology," a history of salsa in New York published by Excelsior and Greenwood, La Lupe regained her ability to walk after being blessed by an evangelical Christian preacher. She began singing Christian music, performing regularly at Iglesia Pentecostal el Fin Se Acerca (Pentecostal Church: The End is Near) in the Bronx. She also recorded a series of albums in salsa and Mexican styles with devotional lyrics.         She is survived by her son, Rene Camano, and her daughter, Rainbow Garcia, both of the Bronx.       
         Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.         She died of cancer, a relative said.         Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.         Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.         Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.         She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.       
         Ruth Hammond, an actress whose career on Broadway spanned half a century, died in her sleep on Thursday, her 96th birthday, at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J.         Miss Hammond created the role of Cora in the 1939 hit play "Life With Father" and remained in the cast for the entire run of the show, missing only one performance in seven and a half years. Her first appearance on Broadway was in 1920 in "The Ouija Board"; her other credits included "Saturday's Children" with Ruth Gordon and "The Good Fairy" with Helen Hayes, as well as "Winterset," "The Women" and "Life With Mother."         Miss Hammond was born in Los Angeles, and was a graduate of the University of California in Berkeley. In addition to her acting, she was an artist known for portraits and caricatures.         She is survived by a son, Eric McDonald, of Langhorn, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Nika Hazelton, whose cookbooks have been a mainstay of serious cooks for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of natural causes after a lingering illness, said her son, Dr. S. A. Standen, who lives in London.         Mrs. Hazelton, the daughter of a German diplomat, was born in Rome, attended school there, and studied at the London School of Economics. She began her career as a reporter in 1930, covering the League of Nations for the German Press Association and then moving on to freelance work.         After marrying and emigrating to the United States in 1940, she began writing cookbooks with recipes culled primarily from home cooks throughout Europe and South America.         She published 30 books and they reflected her firm, no-nonsense taste in food. "American Home Cooking" (Bobbs Merrill, 1967), "French Home Cooking" (Viking Penguin, 1979,) "International Cookbook" (Harper & Row, 1967) and "The Italian Cookbook (Henry Holt, 1979) remain standards.         She was also a frequent contributer to the major food magazines and for several decades wrote a column about food, wine and travel for The National Review.         As cooking became trendy and precious in the United States, she seemed to raise a speculative eyebrow. Facing a group of wine writers in New York several years ago, Mrs. Hazelton waved aside questions about white truffles and little-known family vineyards. "I'm here to show you a meal from Tuscany that has the virtue of not being too expensive and not taking much genius or fuss to prepare," she informed her audience and proceeded to demonstrate the proper way to make escarole and rice soup.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1954. She married Harold Hazelton in 1956. He died in November.         Mrs. Hazelton is survived by two sons, Dr. Standen and J. O. Standen, a lawyer in San Francisco, and three grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on April 28 at St. Agnes Church on East 43d Street in Manhattan.         Correction:  April 18, 1992, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about the cookbook author Nika Hazelton misstated the day of her death and the date of a memorial service. She died on Wednesday, and the service will be on April 27, at 3 P.M., at the Church of St. Agnes, 141 East 43d Street, in Manhattan.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Later, she taught social work at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and maintained an active practice in cognitive therapy.         She is survived by her husband, Gabriel; a son, Jeffrey, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Jan Doughery of Sedona, Ariz; a brother, Martin Whitman of New York City; a sister, Judge Phyllis Beck of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.       
         Johnnie Lee Macfadden, an author and physical-fitness advocate, died April 6 at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A native of Fort Worth, Mrs. Macfadden had a first career as an interior designer. In 1948, she became the third wife of Bernarr Macfadden, the physical culturist and publisher who died in 1955 at the age of 87.         She was a regular monthly contributor to her husband's publications, "Physical Culture" and "Health Review," lectured on fitness, appeared on television talk shows, developed her own line of creams and lotions, and maintained a counseling service on mental and physical health in her apartment until the time of her death.         She was the author of "Barefoot in Eden: The Macfadden Plan for Health, Charm and Long-Lasting Youth," published by Prentice Hall in 1962.         Mrs. Macfadden is survived by a son, Jack of Brooklyn; a daughter, Carol Tumbridge of Denver; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Tenzer, a benefactor of educational institutions, died Wednesday at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was 86 years old and had lived in Lawrence, L.I., since 1947.         The cause of death was cancer, according to a statement from Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Tenzer was born Florence Navor in Philadelphia. She and her husband of 62 years, former United States Representative Herbert Tenzer, took leading roles at the university for many years. Their $1 million dollar gift in 1989 endowed a Herbert and Florence Tenzer University Fellows Program to benefit outstanding students at Yeshiva's graduate schools. She also was active in Jewish affairs.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Tenzer is survived by a son, Barry, of Manhattan and Quogue, L.I.; a daughter, Diane Schachter, of Hewlett Bay Park, L.I., and nine grandchildren.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Gougam Estrin, a physician in New Rochelle, N.Y., for more than 35 years and a member of the faculty at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan, died on May 16 in Paris during a visit. She was 79 years old.         Dr. Estrin died of a heart attack, said her son, James.         A native of New York City, Dr. Estrin attended Smith College and began medical studies at the University of Austria, in Vienna. She received her medical degree from the Women's Medical College, in Philadelphia.         Dr. Estrin, a pediatrician, centered her practice on the care of underprivileged children. Dr. Estrin retired from her practice in 1988 and moved to Los Angeles.         Dr. Estrin's husband, Dr. Irving Jonathan Estrin, died several years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Los Angeles, and James, of Yonkers; two daughters, Jennifer, of Los Angeles, and Judy, of San Luis Obispo, Calif., and two sisters, Gertrude Drachmanad, of New Rochelle, and Margaret Galgau, of Paris.       
         Janet Wolf Levy, a patron of the arts, died yesterday at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan and Armonk, N.Y.         Mrs. Levy died of lung cancer, her family said.         She was named by Mayor David N. Dinkins earlier this month as one of several recipients of the annual Mayor's Very Special Arts Awards for promoting the arts for people with disabilities.         She was the chairwoman of Creative Alternatives, a drama therapy program at the Mount Sinai Medical Center.         Mrs. Levy became a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs & Company in 1976 at the death of her husband of 42 years, Gustave L. Levy. Mr. Levy was the head of Goldman, Sachs, a leading international investment banking firm, and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.

         Lydia Joel, the former editor in chief of Dance Magazine and head of the dance department at the School of Performing Arts, died on Sunday at New York Hospital She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, said her husband, Edwin Miller.         As teacher and journalist, Miss Joel helped to increase appreciation of dance as an art and to raise standards of dance writing and training. Appointed editor in chief of Dance Magazine in 1952, she began to emphasize serious criticism, essays, photographic features and foreign reports. As a result, a publication that had previously been read largely by performers and teachers came to appeal to the general dance audience.         Through her early teaching activities in Texas, she acknowledged the importance of fostering dance across America. And at the School of Performing Arts in New York, she supervised a program that prepared young people for professional careers.  Studied Two Methods         Miss Joel, whose maiden name was Tarnower, was born in New York City. She received a bachelor's degree in English from New York University and did additional graduate work at Cornell University. She studied ballet at the School of American Ballet and modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and Hanya Holm, two leaders of the German modern dance that flourished before World War II. She also attended summer sessions of the Bennington (Vt.) School of Dance, the forerunner of today's American Dance Festival.         At Bennington in 1937, Miss Joel danced in the premiere of "Trend," Miss Holm's monumentally scaled depiction of social conflicts. In New York that same year, Miss Joel appeared in Max Reinhardt's production of "The Eternal Road."         She taught in 1938 at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and from 1938 to 1944 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she headed her own company.         Her first husband was the conductor Gerhard Joel; he died in 1946 but she retained Joel as her professional name. She married Mr. Miller, the entertainment editor of Seventeen magazine, in 1953.         Miss Joel joined the staff of Dance Magazine in 1947, working in the editorial and advertising departments. When she left the publication in 1969, the staff, under her guidance, had grown from 4 to 15 people.         Miss Joel directed the dance department of the School of Performing Arts from 1973 until her retirement in 1984, producing the high school's annual concerts and arranging a performance by 12 of its students at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982.         She served on the board of directors of the American College Dance Festival, the Association of American Dance Companies and the National Association for Regional Ballet, and contributed articles to Vogue, Parents Magazine and other publications. In recent years, she lectured and wrote about Catherine de' Medici, the Renaissance monarch who influenced the development of ballet in European courts.         In addition to her husband, Miss Joel is survived by a son, Eric Miller of Manhattan, and three brothers, Irving Tarnower of Teaneck, N.J., Dr. William Tarnower of Topeka, Kans., and Gerald Tarnower of Dallas.       
         Judith Brown, a sculptor of figurative works in steel, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Leslie.         Using scrap and shaped steel and junkyard objects, Ms. Brown produced works that ranged from totemic Egyptian figures to prancing horses to liturgical objects for churches and synagogues. She made "Caryatids," a monumental sculpture of scrap steel, for the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens at Pepsico in Purchase, N.Y. Among other institutions that own her work are the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. She also made jewelry from unconventional materials like artichoke leaves and palm bark as well as gold, silver and brass.         Ms. Brown was born in New York City. She majored in art at Sarah Lawrence College, studying sculpture with Theodore Roszak, an early exponent of direct metal welding. Under his tutelage, she opened her own studio in New York after graduation, and later she set up a studio in Reading, Vt., where she worked in the summers. Her sculpture was influenced by the classical, Renaissance and Baroque works she sketched on trips to Europe, but it was also inspired by her love of dance, particularly the techniques and choreography of Martha Graham.         A large wall sculpture by Ms. Brown, commissioned by the Federal Government's General Services Administration, is to be installed this summer at the Federal Courthouse in Trenton, N.J. A show of her recent, smaller works will open May 21 at Meisner SoHo, a gallery in Manhattan.         Besides her daughter, who lives on Staten Island, Ms. Brown is survived by a son, Christopher, of Portland, Me., and a brother, Peter Stettenheim, of East Plainfield, Vt.

         Margaretha Ley, chief designer and co-founder of Escada AG, the German women's apparel company known for colorful, highly decorated sportswear, died last Thursday in Munich after a long illness.         Mrs. Ley lived in Munich. The company would not disclose her age or cause of death, but she underwent intestinal surgery in recent months.         Mrs. Ley and her husband, Wolfgang Ley, founded Escada in 1979 and built it into an international company that had sales topping $800 million last year. They took the name Escada, which means staircase in Portuguese, from a racehorse, believing it boded well for their future. There are 140 Escada boutiques around the world, including a six-story shop that opened on 57th Street in New York last November. The clothes are also sold in 1,200 specialty and department stores around the world.         In addition to the Escada label, the company also manufactures women's clothing under the Crisca, Laurel, Apriori and Natalie Acatrini labels, produces the Cerruti 1881 women's collection under a licensing agreement and owns a majority percentage of St. John Knits, a California knitwear concern, and Badgley-Mischka, a New York company known for evening wear. The company also makes accessories, luggage, small leather goods and a perfume called Escada. The Leys took Escada public in 1986, retaining 51 percent of the voting stock.         In recent years, Mrs. Ley directed a team of designers who turned out 1,200 styles each season under the Escada label alone. The clothes are divided into color groups, with coordinating shoes, scarfs, gloves and jewelry. New merchandise is shipped to stores every two weeks. Prices are in the upper bracket, with jackets averaging $1,000.         Born in Sweden, Mrs. Ley worked as a model in Stockholm, Vienna and Paris before turning to design. She designed for Mondi, a German sportswear manufacturer, for 10 years before founding Escada with her husband, whom she had married in 1974.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Sven Ley, of Munich, and two children from a previous marriage, Karin Srb, of Munich, and Kristian Srb, of Water Mill, N.Y.       
         Dr. Joanna Hollenberg Sher, a professor of clinical pathology at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn, died on July 4 at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.

Dr. Sher, who earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1952 and a medical degree from its school of medicine in 1956, was an authority on neuropathology. She published more than 60 papers and more than 40 abstracts of speeches on the human brain. With Dr. Richard Lectenberg, Dr. Sher was co-editor of a book, "AIDS in the Nervous System," published in 1988 by Churchill-Livingstone.

         Caroline Miller Ray, whose first novel won the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for literature, died on Sunday at her home in Waynesville, N.C. She was 88 years old.         A son, George A. Miller, said the exact cause of death was not known.         Under the name Caroline Miller, Mrs. Ray burst upon the national scene with the publication of the prize-winning book "Lamb in His Bosom," a tale, derived from the history of her extended family, about a backwoods community in pre-Civil War Georgia.  Reviewing it for The New York Times Book Review, Louis Kronenberger wrote that it had "a wonderful freshness about it; not simply the freshness of a new writer, but the freshness of a new world," and that Mrs. Ray's strength was her ability to use words to paint "a wonderful large and vital picture."         At the time, she lived in Baxley, Ga., and was married to her first husband, William D. Miller. The Millers were divorced in 1936. In 1937, she married Clyde H. Ray Jr., a businessman in Waynesville. Mr. Ray died in 1976.         She published her second and final work in 1944, a novel called "Lebanon," which described the beauty of nature and the rhythm of rural life.         In addition to her son George, of Mountain Home, N.C., she is survived by two other sons, William D. Miller Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Clyde H. Ray 3d of Cullowhee, N.C.; a daughter, Caroline Ray Morgan of Annapolis, Md.; 17 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Helen M. Serfling, an art director for national magazines, advertising agencies and department stores, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Milton Simpson, her companion.         Ms. Serfling's clients in recent years included People, Sports Illustrated and McCall's magazines and the Chiat-Day advertising agency.         She was divorced. Surviving are a son, Richard P. Mathias of Wiesbaden, Germany; two daughters, Natalie Wolfe of Manhattan and Sasha Wolfe of Brooklyn; a brother, Rudy Zerabica, and a sister, Josephine Simmons, both of Trafford, Pa., and one granddaughter.       
         Hope Miller Lessman, a former actress and real estate executive, died on July 25 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lance.         As Hope Miller, Mrs. Lessman appeared in numerous dramas on film, the Broadway stage, and in television between 1940 and 1954. Her credits included the live television drama "This Thing Called Love" with Ralph Bellamy in 1948; the 1950 Broadway play "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" with Fredric March, and the 1954 live television drama "The Wages of Fear," with Louis Jourdan.         In 1953 Mrs. Lessman married Herbert L. Miskend, the president of a New York-based apparel company, and retired from acting. When Mr. Miskend died in 1962, Mrs. Lessman became president of Dural Realty Corporation, a company Mr. Miskend had owned, and she managed several buildings on a portion of the site now occupied by the Continental Illinois Building at Madison Avenue and 53d Street in Manhattan. She held that post until 1969, when she sold her property there.         Mrs. Lessman married Jac Lessman, a hotel and resort developer, in 1965. He died in 1990.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Henry. Both are from Manhattan.       
         Ruth Batchelor, a songwriter and radio and television reporter, died on July 23 at South Miami Hospital in Florida. She was 58 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Peter Kory.         Ms. Batchelor began her career as a songwriter, writing songs for Elvis Presley. She also wrote several musicals, including a version of "Tom Jones" for CBS-TV. In 1971, she released an album of women's liberation songs called "Reviving a Dream" on Femme Records, a company she began.         Ms. Batchelor founded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association in 1975, and was its president and executive director for three years. She was an entertainment reporter for ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and a film critic for National Public Radio.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Douglas, of Covelo, Calif.; her parents, Lil and Albert Tarshis of Las Vegas, Nev.; a sister, Lolo Berkoff, and a brother, Stanley Gordon, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
         Georgia Brown, a gravelly voiced singer and an earthy actress who originated the role of Nancy in the musical "Oliver!," died yesterday in London. She was 57 years old and lived in Hollywood.         She died at Charing Cross Hospital, The Associated Press reported, saying her death was after a brief illness. She was in London to appear in a tribute to Sammy Davis Jr. at the Drury Lane Theater.         She was named Lillian Klot at her birth in the East End of London, and she took her professional name from "Sweet Georgia Brown" and "Georgia on My Mind," two of the standards she belted out night after night as she made the rounds of dance halls and cabarets in the 1950's. She was also known for performing bluesy ballads and dancing with a neighbor, Vidal Sassoon. (She was his first customer when he opened his first salon in 1954.)         "The nightclub floor is such an incredible teacher," she said in 1963. "It gives you contact with an audience; the legitimate theater rarely talks back to you. Nightclubs teach you discipline, concentration, control." Even Lenya Was Pleased         From jazz, she turned to acting, appearing on British television in "Mother Courage and Her Children" and, in 1955, in "The Threepenny Opera," by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, in London. In New York, she succeeded Lotte Lenya at the Theatre de Lys in Greenwich Village. Referring to Weill's widow and a role in the Brecht-Weill classic, Miss Brown boasted that "even Lotte Lenya thinks I can do Jenny."         But she was best known for a role that grew out of an unexpected moment at a 1960 audition. The producer of "Oliver!," Lionel Bart, had grown up in the same neighborhood and recognized her when she walked in, shouting the name he knew her by. Flustered, she took a moment to respond, since she was no longer Lily Klot. But after seeing her perform, he decided she was just what he needed and wrote "As Long As He Needs Me" and "It's a Fine Life" for her.         "I don't know anything about acting yet, but I keep studying as much as I can," she said after performing the role both on Broadway and in London.         She was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award as best actress for her role in "Oliver!," but lost to Vivian Leigh for "Tovarich." Stint as BBC Producer         In the 1970's Miss Brown was a producer for the BBC. She produced and appeared in "Shoulder to Shoulder," a history of the women's movement at the turn of the century that was shown in this country as a six-part "Masterpiece Theater" series on public television.         In 1979, she starred as a volcanic Italian heroine opposite Cesare Siepi in the Alan Jay Lerner-Joseph Stein-Burton Lane musical "Carmelina." It closed after 17 performances. Steven Berkoff's "Greek," in which she also appeared, did not last much longer, though she received generally good reviews, as she did in "Roza" on Broadway in 1987. She also appeared in a solo show, "Georgia Brown and Friends."         Miss Brown is survived by a son, Jonathan.       
         Desanka Mohorovicic, who made front-page news in 1942 by giving birth in a crowded lifeboat off North Carolina after the American ship she was traveling on was sunk by a submarine, died last Thursday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. She was 78 years old and lived in River Edge, N.J.         She died after a long illness, the Beaugard Funeral Home in River Edge said.         Mrs. Mohorovicic, the wife of a Yugoslav consular official, was en route to New York from South Africa in March 1942 when a German U-boat torpedoed her ship. A Brooklyn physician, Dr. Leonard H. Conly, delivered the baby without anesthesia in a lifeboat tossed about in 15-foot waves even though he himself had two broken ribs.         Mrs. Mohorovicic is survived by her son, Jesse Roper Mohorovic of Scituate, Mass., who was baptized at St. Patrick's Cathedral after being rescued by the destroyer Jesse Roper; two daughters, Vesna Jurick of River Edge and Grace Murray of New York City, and four grandchildren.       
         Irene Silva de Santolalla, a Peruvian educator and author who in 1956 became the first woman in the country to be elected senator, died on Thursday at her home in Lima, the capital. She was 90 years old.         Her family said yesterday that she died after a long illness. Further details were not available.         Mrs. Santolalla was honored by many governments for her writing on children and adolescents and her efforts to raise awareness of the importance of family relations. The Union of American Women, a private group based in Washington with chapters in most Latin American countries, named her its Woman of the Americas in 1956.         The Peruvian Government honored her with its highest award, the Order of the Sun, 10 years ago.         Elected to the Senate in 1956, she served for six years and won praise as the author of a law on family education enacted in Peru in 1957.         Mrs. Santolalla also founded Government institutes for training teachers in Peruvian cities and was a sought-after lecturer throughout Europe and Latin America on family education and child development.         She wrote several books on the conditions faced by children and adolescents and served as an adviser to the United Nations and two of its agencies, Unesco and Unicef.         She is survived by her husband of 71 years, Fausto Santolalla Bernal, 101 years old; two daughters, Irene Santolalla Silva and Maria Teresa Santolalla Silva, and a son, Javier Santolalla Silva, all of Lima; nine grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Edith R. Peterson, a medical researcher into cell cultures at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Saturday at Horton Memorial Hospital in Middletown, N.Y. She was 78 years old and had moved to Middletown two years ago from the Bronx.         She died of a stroke, said Art Oshins, a spokesman at Albert Einstein.         Ms. Peterson, who was born in Brooklyn, had been associated with the college since 1966. She was known for several innovations in her specialty, organotypic cultures -- cultures typical of an organ -- of nerve and muscle tissues.         The college reported that one important contribution led to the recognition that myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve cells, can be grown in test tubes. The finding, which she made in 1948, aided multiple-sclerosis research, since the destruction of myelin causes that disease, the college said.         Ms. Peterson graduated from Barnard College in 1937 with a major in zoology, and earned an M.A. in that discipline at Columbia University two years later.         Ms. Peterson is survived by her husband, Charles; a son, Wesley; a daughter, Ronnie, and three grandchildren, all of Middletown.       
         Francisca Kallir, a co-owner of the Galerie St. Etienne, a New York art gallery specializing in paintings by Grandma Moses and by Austrian and German Expressionists, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Kallir (pronounced kah-LEER) was born in Oberau in what is now southern Germany. A countess by birth, she was named Francisca zu Lowenstein. She attended schools in England and Germany and in 1922 married Otto Kallir, who owned an art gallery and a publishing house in Vienna.         The Kallirs and their two children fled Nazism in 1938, settled in Manhattan in 1939, and founded the gallery at 46 West 57th Street. It was moved to 24 West 57th Street in 1960.         The gallery at first dealt mainly in works by Austrian and German Expressionists, among them Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, but soon became a showcase for the work of Grandma Moses. The artist had her first one-woman show there in 1940.         Mr. Kallir died in 1978.         Mrs. Kallir is survived by a daughter, Evamarie, of Vienna; a son, John, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and two granddaughters.       
         Virginia Sale, a character actress whose career in theater, film, radio and television spanned more than four decades, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 93 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Miss Sale was best known for her work in Hollywood, where by her count she played more than 300 supporting roles in films, beginning with silent comedies in 1927 and concluding with "Slither" in 1970.         She also appeared for eight years in the radio serial "Those We Love," and she wrote and starred in "The Wrens' Nest," one of television's first family comedies, which was broadcast by ABC in 1949. She was frequently seen on the Garry Moore and Kate Smith shows and in other television comedies, including "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres."         Miss Sale also won acclaim for her one-woman show, "Americana Sketches," in which she drew upon her upbringing in Urbana, Ill., to explore the foibles and humor of small town-America.         Miss Sale attended the University of Illinois for two years and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her films included the 1930 "Moby Dick," with John Barrymore, and a string of Westerns, including "Badman's Territory" and "Trail Street," with Randolph Scott.         Miss Sale's husband, Sam Wren, an actor and director, died in Hollywood in 1962.         She is survived by a daughter, Virginia Wren Moore of Lake Forest, Ill., and a son, Christopher S. Wren of Manhattan, who is editor of new projects for The New York Times.       
         Karena P. Somerville, the manager of Consolidated Edison's Customer Outreach program, died on Thursday. She was 46 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         Mrs. Somerville died in an automobile accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway near the Orchard Beach exit in the Bronx. Her car struck a tree early Thursday morning in a construction area, the police said.         Mrs. Somerville, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Syracuse University. In 1973 she joined Con Edison's public-affairs department in Westchester. In 1987 she was named director of public affairs for Con Edison's Westchester customer service unit, and in 1990 she was named assistant to the chairman of Consolidated Edison.         Mrs. Somerville is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Kelley; a son, Chad; a twin sister, Tamara Westover, all of Rye, and her father, Paul Buiar of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Marian A. Granowitz, a former vice chairwoman of the Republican State and Westchester County Committees, died on Thursday at Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 78 years old and a lifelong resident of Port Chester, N.Y.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         Mrs. Granowitz's unpaid party work was a labor of love. Moving steadily up the ladder of leadership in the Westchester organization in the 1970's and 1980's, she served as its vice chairwoman, then regional vice chairwoman to coordinate Republican activities in five counties. She finally became a state vice chairwoman.         Born in Port Chester, she graduated from public high school and went to work for B. Altman's White Plains store. She headed its cosmetics department but quit to raise her children.         Her husband, Irving M. Granowitz, a certified public accountant, died in 1975.         Mrs. Granowitz is survived by two daughters, Ida Granowitz of Manhattan, and Tina Marks of Hartsdale, N.Y.; a son, Philip of Stanford, Conn.; a brother, Milton Smith of Port Chester, and three grandchildren.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Ruth Nelson, an actress in the legendary Group Theater that transformed American acting and whose career on stage, film and television spanned nearly 70 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer complicated by a stroke and pneumonia, her family said.         Ms. Nelson began acting in the early 1920's and last appeared onstage in "Uncle Vanya" in New York last year and on film in the 1990 movie "Awakenings."         During the 1930's she was a charter member of the Group, which gave birth to modern American acting. The Group infused its work with new psychological insights, naturalistic style and political content. It produced many top actors, directors and acting teachers, including Lee J. Cobb, Morris Carnovsky, John Garfield, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Stella Adler and Lee Strasburg, and led to new techniques, including the Method. 'They Couldn't Applaud Any More'         In a great moment of theater history, Ms. Nelson was the taxicab driver's wife in the original cast of Clifford Odets' "Waiting for Lefty." On opening night in 1935, the audience gave an extraordinary 45-minute ovation.         "When they couldn't applaud any more, they stomped their feet," she later recalled. "All I could think was, 'My God, they're going to bring the balcony down!' It was terrible, it was so beautiful."         For 33 years she was married to John Cromwell, founder of the Screen Directors Guild. Among his directing credits were "Of Human Bondage," in which Miss Nelson played the wife, "Algiers," "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" and "The Goddess."         But when Mr. Cromwell was accused of Communism in the 1950's -- a charge he denied in Congressional testimony -- his career went into a blacklisted eclipse. At the time, Ms. Nelson was offered a New York stage role as a wife in what turned out to be a monumental play, "Death of a Salesman." She turned it down to stay in Los Angeles to help her husband through his ordeal.         Mr. Cromwell died in 1979. A Nun's Encouragement         Born in Flint, Mich., Ms. Nelson grew up on the vaudeville circuit with her mother, Eva Mudge, a noted quick-change artist. Then she went to Los Angeles to study at a Roman Catholic school. Although her mother had discouraged Ms. Nelson from a show business career, a nun saw her potential and nudged her to Broadway.         Her stage performances won critical praise. Her film debut came in 1944 in four movies, and she made nine more in the next four years. Her later films included Robert Altman's "3 Women" and "Wedding" in the 1970's.         In a 1966 review in The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote that her portrayal of Mrs. Antrobus in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth" was "very easily the best" he had seen. "Miss Nelson misses no nuance of reality that the part offers, and in one moment -- when she mourns her murdered son Abel -- she touches true elegy," he wrote.         Her first marriage, to actor William Challee, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two sisters, Linda Stack of Darien, Conn., and Gay Samuelson of Los Angeles; a stepson, James Cromwell of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.

         Mary Wells Ashworth, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, died on Saturday at the Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Va. She was 89 years old and lived in Richmond.         Mrs. Ashworth died of a ruptured aorta, said her son, Osbourne Orlando Ashworth Jr. of Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Ashworth grew up in Florida and moved to Virginia with her family as a teen-ager. She graduated from Hollins College in Hollins, Va., in 1924, and later served on the college's board.         For many years, Mrs. Ashworth was a research associate of the historian Douglas Southall Freeman, the author of a multi-volume biography of George Washington. After Professor Freeman died in 1953, she and another research associate, John A. Carroll, wrote the seventh and final volume of Freeman's authoritative "George Washington, a Biography" published by Scribner's in 1957. The entire work won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1958 and Columbia University's Loubat Prize the same year.         Mrs. Ashworth also contributed to the World Book Encyclopedia and to the compendium "Notable American Women 1607-1950."         Mrs. Ashworth's husband, Dr. Osbourne O. Ashworth, a physician, died in 1945. In addition to her son Osbourne, Mrs. Ashworth is survived by another son, Dr. John Sheriden Ashworth of Richmond.       
         Amelia Lobsenz, a public-relations executive who ran her own firm in Manhattan for the last 36 years, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in Old Brookville, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Kay Abrahams.         A native of Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Lobsenz graduated from Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., and became one of the first women to rise into the executive ranks of her profession.         She formed Lobsenz Public Relations in 1956; it became Lobsenz-Stevens Inc. in 1975. At the time of her death she was board chairwoman and chief executive of the firm, which counts American Home Products, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Procter & Gamble among its clients.         Besides her daughter, a Manhattan resident, Ms. Lobsenz is survived by her husband, Dr. Harry Abrahams; a son, Michael Lobsenz of Boyds, Md., and three grandchildren.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Esta Brodey Huttner, a founder and longtime board member of the Karen Horney Foundation, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         Her family said she died of cardiopulmonary failure.         She underwent psychotherapy with a disciple of Karen Horney, the German-born psychoanalyst whose methods departed from Freudian orthodoxy. She then befriended Dr. Horney and was so impressed with the analyst's work that she joined a group of people who decided to carry it on.         When Dr. Horney died in 1952, the Karen Horney Foundation was formed. It raised funds to start a clinic that would offer affordable or free services and serve as a training center for psychotherapists.         The Karen Horney Clinic opened in Manhattan in 1955. Mrs. Huttner was vice chairman of the board of directors from then until 1975, and continued as a director into the 1980's.         Mrs. Huttner, who was born in Brooklyn, started a business career as a millinery buyer for a department store. From 1946 to 1960, she operated a Brooklyn glass factory, Peerless Art, creating hand-painted designs on glass.         In 1975 she became the first national administrator for the Cancer Research Institute in Manhattan, which finances immunological research looking for a cancer cure. Mrs. Huttner retired in 1983.         Mrs. Huttner is survived by a son, Dr. James F. Brodey of West Hartford, Conn.; a stepson, Richard Huttner of Middletown, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Hilary Fylstra of Lake Tahoe, Nev.; a sister, Celia Hartley of New Port Richey, Fla.; and four grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Disney MacKaye, who chronicled marital woes and dispensed advice for 30 years through a column in The Ladies' Home Journal, "Can This Marriage Be Saved?", died on Saturday at her summer home in Guilford, Conn. She was 88 years old and lived in Guilford and Washington.         She died of a heart attack, said her son, William R. MacKaye of Washington.         Mrs. MacKaye, who wrote under the byline Dorothy Cameron Disney, was something of a pioneer both as an advice columnist and a marriage counselor, and for generations of readers her column -- entertaining, occasionally titillating, sometimes a little pedantic -- served as a spyglass into the lives of anonymous strangers.         The column, which first appeared in January 1953, continues today. In Mrs. MacKaye's hands it was devoted each month to the travails of a married couple. Based on interviews and then written largely in dialogue, as if in the voices of the troubled partners, the columns dealt with issues like jealousy, infidelity, money problems and, increasingly as time went on and moral strictures relaxed, sexual problems.         "The columns seem to represent a chronicle of the many changes in the institution of marriage -- and the fascination it holds," Mrs. MacKaye said in a retrospective essay written for the 100th anniversary issue of The Ladies' Home Journal in January 1984. Looking back on her three decades as a columnist, she concluded that of all marital problems, "the single greatest pitfall of all times" is the inability of husband and wife to communicate. " 'He (or she) never listens' is universal," she wrote.         By the time she began her career as a columnist, she was the author of nine mystery novels, and she believed she was successful as a columnist, her son said in an interview, because of her training as a storyteller. Her technique, he said, was to take her prospective subject couple out to dinner to prime and cajole them and then afterward to speak with them separately. She would also interview their marriage counselor.         In the column, the names were never divulged and identifying details were not provided. "She would always tell the couples that unless they told their friends they'd never be recognized," her son said. "Those people who told their friends were invariably recognized -- and embarrassed."         In the beginning, the column was a collaboration between Mrs. MacKaye and Dr. Paul Popenoe, the founder of the American Institute of Family Relations, a marriage counseling agency in Hollywood. Dr. Popenoe put her in touch with his patients, who then became her subjects. Later on, as the column became more well known, Mrs. MacKaye made it entirely her own, calling on counseling agencies across the country for source material.         Mrs. MacKaye was born in 1904 in Atoka, Indian Territory, part of what became the State of Oklahoma in 1907, and grew up in Muskogee. Her father, Loren G. Disney, was a lawyer and a local political figure. She attended several colleges, including George Washington University and Barnard College, but never graduated. Her son said her explanation for this was that she refused to take any science courses.         Mrs. MacKaye's marriage to Milton MacKaye, a magazine writer, endured for 50 years until his death in 1979.         In her addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter-in-law, Mary Anne MacKaye, and five grandchildren.       
         Patricia Phipps Buckley, a psychotherapist practicing in Manhattan and Queens, died in an accident on Aug. 30 in Southington, Conn. She was 61 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         A police report said she died of multiple injuries received in a fall while on a hiking trip.         Ms. Buckley, a native of Rockville Center, L.I., graduated in nursing and psychology from Adelphi University. She held an M.S. degree in counseling and psychology from Miami University and did postgraduate work in vocational rehabilitation and psychology at Columbia University.         She was a former director of the Manhattan Center for the Living, a voluntary nonprofit organization for people with chronic illnesses. She was also a member of the board of directors for Unicef in New York.         In addition to her practice, Ms. Buckley was involved with Catholic Charities, making home visits to care for patients terminally ill with AIDS-related diseases. She was also an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.         Ms. Buckley is survived by her son, Thomas L. Thron of San Francisco, and her fiance, Herbert Boyer of Manhattan.       
         Eleanor H. Raynolds, an executive search consultant who was honored by the Queen of England for her work for the British-American Chamber of Commerce, died on Tuesday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 55 years old and lived in Stamford.         The cause of her death was a massive staphylococcus infection, said Penny Paul Mooney, an associate at Ward Howell, the executive search firm where she was a partner. She said the cause of the infection has not been determined.         Mrs. Raynolds joined Ward Howell in 1985. Founder of Peer Group         During the early 1980's, she served consecutive terms as president of the British-American Chamber of Commerce, for which she was made a Commander of the British Empire. She was also a founder of the Peer Group, a national association of women in management and the arts, and served as a director of the New York Mission Society, the Women's Economic Round table and Mary Baldwin College.         Together with her husband, John F. Raynolds 3d, former president of Outward Bound USA, she wrote "Beyond Success -- How Volunteer Service Can Help You Begin Making a Life Insead of Just a Living."         Mrs. Raynolds, who trekked in the Himalayas and the Andes and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had just returned from a horse-riding trip in Utah when she died.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, a son, Jayson Kuhn of Silver Spring, Md., and a daughter, Jennifer Irwin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and by two grandchildren.       
         Louise Field Cooper, a novelist and short-story writer, died last Friday at her home in Woodbridge, Conn. She was 87 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, said her son Peter Brintnall Cooper.         Mrs. Cooper was born in Hartford and graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. Her short stories appeared frequently in The New Yorker from 1938 to 1962. Her 10 novels included "The Lighted Box" (1942), "Summer Stranger" (1947) and "The Boys From Sharon" (1950). "Love and Admiration," a collection of her short stories, was published in 1944.         In her fiction, Mrs. Cooper stayed close to home, concocting a delicate social satire from characters and settings familiar to her. "All I write about are the things I know myself, and I've never had very much happen to me," she once said in an interview. Eudora Welty wrote that "her touch is as light as it is sure, and as revealing as it is quiet."         Mrs. Cooper's husband, James Wayne Cooper, a senior partner of the New Haven law firm of Tyler, Cooper & Alcorn, died in 1989.         In addition to her son Peter, of Woodbridge, she is survived by another son, James Nicoll Cooper of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Field McIntyre of London; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Natalie deWolf Paine, a television production administrator at CBS News and at the Columbia University Seminars on Media and Society, died on Wednesday. She was 62 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.         Mrs. Paine's death was reported by her husband, Kenneth Paine, who said she died of cancer at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.         Mrs. Paine joined CBS News as a staff administrator in 1951 and served as staff administrator for the "See It Now" and "CBS Reports" programs, with Edward R. Murrow reporting and Fred W. Friendly producing.         Mr. Friendly described Mrs. Paine yesterday as "a central link, our gyroscope" in coordinating production and information gathering.         She resigned from CBS in 1964 to raise a family. In 1982 she rejoined Mr. Friendly, who was directing Columbia University's seminars on the media and society and helped to produce more than 600 of them.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Jenifer, of Boston; two stepdaughters, Emily Paine of Los Angeles and Rachel Wilson of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Maggie Comer Robinson, whose efforts to overcome her own impoverished background and inspire her children to pursue higher education were recounted in a biography and in a television documentary, died Monday at St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, Ind. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Robinson died of septicemia, a blood infection, said a son, Dr. James P. Comer of North Haven, Conn.         Her five children earned a total of 13 undergraduate and graduate degrees, and all seven of her grandchildren are college graduates.         It was Dr. Comer's recounting of his mother's life in "Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family," published by New American Library in 1988, that brought her to the nation's attention. PBS Documentary         Her story was retold in a Public Broadcasting Service documentary, "The Legacy of Maggie's American Dream," which was first broadcast last month.         Mrs. Robinson, who was born in Woodland, Miss., and reared in Memphis, moved to East Chicago in 1920. She met her first husband, Hugh Comer, in the New Hope Zion Church, where he was a deacon. He died in 1955, and she later married Ervin Robinson of East Chicago. Mr. Robinson died in 1985.         She was a member of the Mothers Board of the New Ebenezer Baptist Church and a vice president of the Washington High School P.T.A. Among the many honors she received after her biography was published was an honorary doctorate awarded last year by Wheelock College in Boston.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Robinson is survived by two other sons, Dr. Norman D. Comer and Dr. Charles Comer, both of East Chicago; two daughters, Louise Comer of Eufala, Ala., and Thelma C. Morris of Gary, Ind.; two sisters, Susie Cossey and Carrie Watkins, both of East Chicago; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

         Gertrude Farber Koskoff, a three-term Representative in the Connecticut General Assembly and former member of the State Board of Parole, died on Thursday at her home in Plainville, Conn. She was 81 years old.         She died of complications from pancreatic cancer, said her son, David.         Active in the Republican Party, Mrs. Koskoff served as a state legislator from 1953 to 1958. She focused on civil rights, the rights of the handicapped and prison reform.         During riots at the state's prisons in the 1950's, Representative Koskoff acted as a mediator at the request of the prisoners. In 1968, she was named to the Parole Board by Gov. John Dempsey, where she served until her retirement in 1990.         Besides her son, of Plainville, she is survived by her husband, Milton M. Koskoff; a daughter, Harriet K.

         Janice Gilbert Fulton, a bridge expert and game-show personality in the early days of television, was presumed dead after a boating accident last week near her home about 150 miles north of Haiti, her lawyer said yesterday.         The lawyer, Ian Miller, said that Mrs. Fulton's husband, David Fulton, 70 years old, a mining engineer, was also presumed dead, as was Dan Cooper, 45, a Canadian real estate developer who was a passenger when the Fultons' 22-foot fishing boat capsized in choppy waters on Thursday morning.         Mr. Miller said he notified the authorities when the Fultons failed to return to their home, on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.         He said rescuers found two survivors, Douglas Colledi of London, Ontario, and Lucien Vixama of Providenciales, in the Fultons' righted boat on Friday. A search of the Caribbean by private planes and the Coast Guard was called off on Sunday.         Family members said Mrs. Fulton was born in New York City about 1920. She played Little Orphan Annie on radio soap operas. Later she played the Paying Teller on the television give-away show "Break the Bank" in the 1950's.         In 1955 she married Tobias Stone of Las Vegas, Nev., a champion bridge player who taught her to play the game. They won the Goldman Pairs in 1957, making them the only married couple to win in the 64-year history of the event; they also won the Master Mixed Team Championship in 1965. She won three other national titles: the Women's Teams in 1956 and 1969 and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1965.         Mr. Stone and Mrs. Fulton divorced in 1975, and in 1980 she married Mr. Fulton, who had been the chief mining engineer in the Stone family gold and silver mining business, where she worked from 1974 to 1978.         Mrs. Fulton's first husband, William Miles, lives in Los Angeles. Her second husband, William Dunlop, is deceased.

         Audre Lorde, a black feminist writer who became the poet laureate of New York State in 1991, died on Tuesday at her home on St. Croix. She was 58 years old.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Blanche Cook.         Ms. Lorde had had cancer for 14 years and in 1980 wrote "The Cancer Journals," which traced the first stages of her disease.         From the publication of her first book in 1968, Ms. Lorde's 17 volumes of poetry, essays and autobiography reflected her hatred of racial and sexual prejudice. Among them are "Cables to Rage" (1970); "Coal" (1976); "Zami: A New Spelling of My Name" (1983), and, most recently, "Undersong: Chosen Poems Old and New," which was recently published by W. W. Norton.         A collection of essays, "A Burst of Light," won an American Book Award in 1989. Her 1973 collection, "From a Land Where Other People Live," was nominated for a National Book Award.  Active Politically and Academically         Ms. Lorde, who also used her adopted African name, Gamba Adisa, was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Library Science. She became an English professor at Hunter and lectured widely throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. She was active in many literary and political organizations and a founding member of Women of Color Press and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa.         She was an outspoken lesbian and served on the board of the Feminist Press in New York City and often gave readings of her works at Judith's Room, a feminist bookstore in Greenwich Village.         Among her honors were the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit in 1991, making her the poet laureate of New York; the Manhattan Borough President's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1988, and honorary doctorates from Hunter, Oberlin and Haverford Colleges.         Her marriage to Edwin Rollins ended in divorce.         She is survived by her companion, Gloria I. Joseph of St. Croix; a son, Jonathan Rollins, and a daughter, Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, both of New York City, and four sisters, Helen Lorde, Phyllis Blackwell and Marjorie and Mavis Jones.

         Carol Weil Haussamen, a New York City philanthropist, hostess and Democratic fund-raiser, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer of the esophagus.         Mrs. Haussamen, a real-estate heiress, was born in Manhattan, the daughter of L. Victor Weil, a real-estate executive, and the former Beatrice Schwab. She attended private schools, including the Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, acquired fluency in French from her governesses and traveled extensively when her mother showed horses. In those years the family also kept an estate in Elberon, N.J., where she spent her summers. Hostess to Ambassadors         From her father she inherited, among other properties, a building on Central Park South, and with it a palatial 20th-floor, 18-room apartment. For the last 25 years or more her home served as a fountainhead of funds for Democratic candidates from around the country.         She served as hostess for foreign ambassadors during the 1976 national convention, and she often entertained other visiting foreign dignitaries as well. She played a role in every subsequent campaign, though her family said that in this Presidential election year she had to curtail her activities somewhat because of her health.

         Charlotte Jones, an actress who appeared in plays and musicals on and Off Broadway and in regional theater, died on Nov. 6 at Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. She was 76 years old and lived in Toms River.         Her death was reported yesterday by her husband, Matteo Bocchino, who said she died of heart disease.         Ms. Jones, whose original name was Charlotte Nathanson, was born in Chicago on Jan. 1, 1916. She was a graduate of Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa, and attended Loyola University Medical School and Loyola University Law School in Chicago. A first marriage, to Dr. Richard Jones of Chicago, ended in divorce in 1947; subsequently Ms. Jones came to New York City to make a career as an actress and dancer, and won her first role on Broadway in 1952 in the musical "Buttrio Square," starring Billy Gilbert. In 'Camino Real'         She appeared in Elia Kazan's Broadway production of Tennessee Williams's play "Camino Real" in 1953, and acted in the play again when it was revived at Circle in the Square in 1980 under the direction of Jose Quintero.         She created the dual roles of Madame Branislowski and Mother Burnside in the 1966 Broadway production of "Mame," starring Angela Lansbury; played the Wall Street widow, Mrs. Millhauser, in the 1967 Broadway musical comedy "How Now, Dow Jones," and acted with Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in 1976 in "A Matter of Gravity." She also played the role of the Fortune Teller in Mr. Quintero's Kennedy Center revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," starring Elizabeth Ashley, which came to Broadway in 1975.         Off Broadway, Ms. Jones appeared in the 1962 production of Thornton Wilder's "Plays for Bleecker Street" at Circle in the Square, in a production directed by Mr. Quintero. She also appeared in "Serjeant Musgrave's Dance" in the 1966 production at the Theater de Lys.  Over 60 Character Roles         Her other Off Broadway credits included "Red Roses for Me," "The Girl on the Via Flaminia," "The Sign of Jonah," "The Knight From Olmedo" and "The Night Is Black Bottles."         Ms. Jones played over 60 character roles in stock theater, and performed in national tours, including that of "Come Blow Your Horn." Her Hollywood films included "Muggable Mary, Street Cop," "Lovers and Other Strangers," "The Fool Killer" and "Middle of the Night."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard David Jones of Three Rivers, Mass.; a daughter, Jeanette Jones Backs of Atlanta; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Hanya Holm, a major choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 99 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said Heidi Holm, her daughter-in-law.         To theatergoers, Miss Holm was known as the choreographer of musicals including Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Out of This World" and Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot." To modern-dance aficionados, Miss Holm was the most significant choreographer and dancer to have come out of the Central European Expressionist dance tradition in Germany. Its most noted figure was Mary Wigman, and Miss Holm was her student. Her 1937 "Trend," a dance of social protest, is considered a masterwork of American modern dance. Miss Holm has been considered a member of a pantheon of American modern-dance choreographers that included Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman.         A funny, humane and uncompromising woman, Miss Holm encouraged her pupils to find their own individual ways of artistic expression. Her students included leading choreographers as diverse as Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, Glen Tetley, Don Redlich and Lucinda Childs. Sound and Movement         Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes. She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915. The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman. Miss Holm was dancing with Wigman's troupe by 1921 and taught in her school in Dresden. She remained a leading Wigman teacher and dancer for 10 years, creating roles in "Feier" and "Totenmal," which she helped Wigman choreograph. It was during this time that she changed her name.         In 1930-31, Sol Hurok brought the Wigman company to the United States for a transcontinental tour. Hurok had urged Wigman to found an American school, and she agreed, sending Miss Holm to America to direct it. Miss Holm arrived in New York City in September 1931, and for the next five years she devoted herself to teaching. She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance. The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective." The distinction, she added, was "one of 'being' as contrasted with 'doing.' "         Miss Holm took on other teaching positions in important dance institutions, among them, in 1934, the Bennington College Summer School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival, where the "Trend" was first performed. In 1941, she developed the influential summer dance program at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, where she continued to teach until 1983. Part of the success of her teaching lay in her pithy instructions to students. "Keep the beat," she told them, "but undermine it." Another instruction was to "use the feet as if you would pick up a flower with your toes." Her students were familiar with the command to "feel it, children, don't schlep it." 'Living Essence'         She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching. "If I see one more leg extension, I've had it," Miss Holm said in 1984. "There is security in a major leg extension. But it means nothing. The simplest thing is to shun the emotions and emphasize technique. But you become like a nice stove that doesn't give any heat." One had to be careful, she noted, of trying to instill that "little bit of living essence." "You can't take something away without         giving         something," she said.         She had begun choreographing in 1928, but her American concert career began in 1937 with a tour of Midwestern colleges. She made her New York debut that year in a program that included "Trend," her first major work in America, which had a cast of 33 dancers, some of them from her own company and the rest students at Bennington. A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp. Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.         John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering." He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen."         One of the best descriptions of Miss Holm's dances and of "Trend" came, however, in an observation made by the choreographer about Wigman's work. "In her dances she alternately grapples with space as an opponent and caresses it as though it were a living, sentient thing," Miss Holm said. "In her gestures and movement she carves boldly and delicately visible and fluid forms, shaping, surrounding and sinking in the space which presses close about her." Early TV, Then Broadway         Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary. In 1939, she also became the first concert dancer to present her work on television in the United States, showing a shortened version of "Metropolitan Daily," a humorous depiction of a daily newspaper.         Miss Holm had abandoned modern dance for the Broadway stage by 1947, although she continued to create dances for her summer students and choreographed four well-received dances for the Don Redlich Dance Company in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's. Her first success was with the 1948 "Ballet Ballads," a suite of dances she created with Katherine Litz and Paul Godkin to music composed by Jerome Moross, with lyrics by John Latouche.         As a result of the success of her dance, "The Eccentricities of Davy Crockett," Miss Holm was invited to choreograph "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948 and won a New York Drama Critics Award. Over the next 18 years, she created dances for 13 musicals becoming known for her ability to meet the stylistic needs of each show. In 1952, she became the first choreographer to copyright a dance: her choreography for "Kiss Me, Kate," submitted as a written Labanotation score on microfilm.         Among Miss Holm's other Broadway musicals were "Out of This World," "My Darlin' Aida" and "The Golden Apple." She also created the dances for the London and Tel Aviv productions of "My Fair Lady." She choreographed and directed the opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe" in 1956 in Central City, Colo., and Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" for the second annual Vancouver International Festival in 1959. Among her film and television assignments were the dances for the 1955 film version of "The Vagabond King." Miss Holm was also known for her essays, published in periodicals and books, on dance teaching and technique.         Her honors included an award from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for her contributions to modern dance in 1958, the Capezio Award, the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award in 1984 and the Astaire Award in 1987. "It just happened," Miss Holm said of her career in accepting the Scripps Award, "and whatever has happened was with love, dedication, good will, gladly and well. I keep on doing it as good as I can and as long as I can."         Miss Holm's marriage to Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a painter and sculptor, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Klaus, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and three granddaughters, Karen Trautlein of Wilkes-Barre, Angela Holm of San Diego and Jessica Werbin of New Haven, Conn.       
         Catharine A. Yard, president of the American Timber Company, died on Thursday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 48 years old and lived in Sea Girt.         Ms. Yard died of pneumonia, said Michael Cherenson, a family spokesman.         In 1990 Ms. Yard became president of American Timber, which was founded by her grandfather in 1893. Ms. Yard, who attended Yuba College in Marysville, Calif., and Chico State University in Chico, Calif., had worked for the company since 1968.         Ms. Yard is survived by a son, Michael Saito, and three daughters, Michelle, Mikiko and Mary Catherine Saito, and her mother, Dorothy, all of Sea Girt; two sisters, Elizabeth Rasmussen, of Chico, Calif., and Victoria Steiner, of Seattle; four brothers, William, of Modesto, Calif., Carl Jr., of Wall Township, N.J., Richard, of Jackson Township, N.J., and Stephen, of Oroville, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Sybil Claiborne, a novelist and short story writer, died Wednesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Hospital. She was 69.         She died of lung cancer, said Grace Paley, the writer, who was a friend.         Ms. Claiborne was active in the antiwar movement and frequently wrote in opposition to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. She was a board member of the War Resister's League for many years.         Ms. Claiborne was in her 50's when her first stories began to appear in magazines like The New Yorker and Esquire. Some of her writing was the basis for a program of comedy-dramas performed in Manhattan in 1978 at Symphony Space.         Her book "Loose Connections," a collection of short stories, was published by Academy Chicago in 1988, and a novel, "A Craving for Women," was published by Dutton in 1989.         Last year she completed "In the Garden of Dead Cars," which is to be published by Cleis in the spring. It is a work of fiction that again reflects her abhorrence of war and tyranny, Ms. Paley said.         At her death, Ms. Claiborne was chairwoman of the Women's Committee of PEN, the writers' organization. She was also a member of the National Writers' Union, of which her husband, Robert Claiborne, was an organizer and founder. He died last year. Her only son, Jan Stacey, died in 1990.         She is survived by a stepdaughter, Amanda Claiborne Shulman of Cambridge, Mass.; a stepson, Sam Claiborne of Brooklyn; a grandson, Matthew Shulman, and a brother, David Resnik of Stockbridge, Mass.         Correction:  December 20, 1992, Sunday         The headline on the obituary of a writer and antiwar campaigner yesterday rendered her last name incorrectly in some copies. She was Sybil Claiborne.       
         Barbara Rollock, an authority on children's literature who worked for 32 years with the New York Public Library, died on Sunday at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 70 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of colon cancer, said her son David.         Joining the Public Library as a clerk at the Aguilar Branch Library in Harlem in 1945, Mrs. Rollock rose to become coordinator of Children's Services in 1974, a post she held until retirement.         For nearly a decade, she moderated the weekly show, "World of Children's Literature," on WNYC public radio, receiving the International Reading Association's media award for radio in 1982.         Mrs. Rollock was former president of the New York Black Librarians Caucas and a past president of the children's divisions of the American Library Association and the New York Library Association.         She was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in Library Science from Columbia University.         She is the author of two books, "Black Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books," published in 1992 by Garland Publishing, and "Public Library Services for Children," published in 1988 by Library Professional Publications. She also edited the 1974, 1979 and 1984 editions of "The Black Experience in Children's Literature," a bibliography, published by the New York Public Library.         Besides her son David, of Zionsville, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Howard, and another son, Phillip Theodore, also of Brooklyn.       
         Carol Bondhus Fitzgerald, head of readers' services at the Mina Rees Library of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Tuesday in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 51 and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Professor Fitzgerald died of cancer at Northern Westchester Hospital Center, said Christy DeBoe Hicks, a City University spokeswoman.         A specialist in American Presidential bibliographies, Professor Fitzgerald was the series editor of three continuing multivolume bibliographies: Bibliographies of the American Presidents, Bibliographies of the United States, and Bibliographies of American Notables. She had been editor of American History: A Bibliographic Review from 1985 to 1991, and history editor of the Bulletin of Bibliography from 1981 to 1990.         She was born in New York City. She graduated from Rosary College in River Forest, Ill., and earned master's degrees at New York University and Columbia University. She joined the Rees Library in 1969.         She is survived by her husband, Kevin; a son, Matthew; three daughters, Anna, Katherine and Margaret, all of Bedford Hills; her mother, Anna Bondhus; her brother, Nelson, of Farmington, Conn., and a sister, Diana Bortolin, of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Maria Teresa Herrera-Uslar, the Dowager Marquesa de Torre Casa, who was a society figure, philanthropist and author, died on Saturday at the Caracas Medical Center in Venezuela. She was 78 and lived in Caracas.         The Marquesa, who was widely known as Mimi Herrera, died of heart failure due to complications from cancer, said her son, Reinaldo Herrera, whose wife is the fashion designer Caroline Herrera.         The objects of the Marquesa's philanthropy included the Venezuelan Red Cross, of which she was chairman for many years, and the National Gallery in Caracas. She was also active in the affairs of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. For more than 40 years, she maintained an apartment in Manhattan.         She was born Maria Teresa Ladron de Guevara in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, and was educated by tutors. Her writings include a book-length collection of her short stories in Spanish, titled "Sad Tales," which was published in Venezuela and Spain, and a Spanish translation of "The Rubaiyat" of Omar Khayyam that came out in Venezuela and is to have a new edition there next year.         Her husband of 30 years, Reinaldo Herrera-Uslar, the Marques de Torre Casa, who owned sugar cane plantations, died in 1962. She is survived by two sons, Reinaldo Herrera of Manhattan and Caracas, who is an editor of Vanity Fair magazine, and Luis Felipe Herrera-Guevara of Caracas, and nine grandchildren.       
         Kay Boyle, a short-story writer and novelist renowned for her deft and powerful style and her keen insights into human nature, died on Sunday night at the Redwoods, a retirement community in Mill Valley, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived at the Redwoods, where she had moved from San Francisco several years ago.         She had been in declining health for a year, said her son, Ian von Franckenstein of Kentland, Calif.         Miss Boyle wrote four dozen books, including many works of fiction, seven books of poetry and four books for children. But it was for her short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, Harper's and elsewhere, that she was particularly acclaimed. Some critics have called "The White Horses of Vienna" (1936) an especially fine collection of her stories.         She won two O. Henry Memorial Awards for short-story writing, one for the title story of that 1936 collection and one for "Defeat" in 1941. She also won a Guggenhiem Fellowship in 1934. The Lady as Radical         The writer Stephen Vincent Benet once described Miss Boyle's style as being "as bright as an icicle and light as the bones of a bird." And the critic Louis Kronenberger once contended that the fineness of her insights was "such as no other writer of our time, in English at least, can match."         Her work, which also included essays and translations, commanded admiration from critics for more than half a century. It was colored by years of living in different parts of Europe -- she moved to Brittany in 1923, then lived in Paris and elsewhere -- and by social and political concerns. Her 1936 novel "Death of a Man" contained material from her life in Austria in the mid-1930's.         Late in her life, Miss Boyle wrote that she saw herself "as a dangerous 'radical' cleverly disguised as a perfect lady." She reported that she could not remember a time beyond the age of 6 when she had not been committed in favor of, or opposed to, something. Her activities ranged from helping the families of conscientious objectors in World War I to supporting human-rights causes and demonstrating against United States involvement in Vietnam. But she also had passionate and abiding literary concerns.         Reviewing a 1988 collection of her short stories, "Life Being the Best & Other Stories," edited by Sandra Whipple (New Directions), Ann Hornaday wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book celebrated her "enduring artistic discipline.' At Home in Europe         "Unlike some of her better-known peers," Ms. Hornaday wrote, Miss Boyle "survived the halcyon days of Paris in the 1920's," and although she "is not as notorious as some of the other Moderns -- those intrepid expatriate writers who set out to change language, mesh literature and social context and expose the dissonance of contemporary life -- she evokes these tensions with a gossamer fineness."         Miss Boyle was born in St. Paul on Feb. 19, 1902, the daughter of Howard P. Boyle and the former Katharine Evans. She spent much of her childhood in Europe and then returned to the United States, where she attended school in Washington for a time.         After financial problems, the family moved to Cincinnati. Miss Boyle took violin lessons at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and attended the Ohio Mechanics Institute from 1917 to 1919, intending to go into architecture.         With her first husband, Richard Brault, a French engineer whom she had met in Cincinnati and married in 1923, Miss Boyle briefly lived in New York City, where she attended Columbia University. The couple then went to Europe, where Miss Boyle stayed for almost 20 years, living in England as well as France and Austria, and taking a fellow American expatriate, Laurence Vail, as her second husband in 1931 after she was divorced from her first.         In that period, she looked more kindly on Europeans than on her compatriots and on many of her fellow female writers. "I like to be with people who work -- English, French, or any foreign working people," she wrote, but "I am ill at ease with Americans."         She observed that most women "do not write simply or violently enough for my taste." She added, "I should like my prose to be lucid, direct and lean." A Poet in Later Years         Miss Boyle and Mr. Vail returned to the United States in 1941. They later divorced, and in 1943 she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein.After World War II she was a correspondent in Europe for The New Yorker for a time. She went on to become a professor of English and creative writing at San Francisco State University from 1963 to 1979.         Her son said her last new book to be published was was "Words That Must Somehow Be Said: Selected Essays of Kay Boyle" (North Point Press, 1985).         Reviewing "50 Stories," a collection of her work published in 1980, Vance Bourjaily wrote in The New York Times that the stories included such techniques as "literary simplification, rhythmic repetition, the mixing in of vernacular, stream of consciousness, density of impressions, radical imagery and experiments with surrealism." The collection was republished this year by New Directions Books.         Mr. Von Franckenstein said Miss Boyle had continued to write and that most of her recent work was poetry, some of which had been published.         In addition to her son, an actor whose stage name is Ian Swift, she is survived by a sister, Joan Detweiler of Sarasota, Fla.; four daughters, Sharon Cowling of Vezenobres, France; Kathe Vail, who lives outside Paris; Clover Vail of New York City, and Faith Gude of Boston; 17 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jennie Resnick Bernstein, the mother of Leonard Bernstein, who contributed lyrics for a segment of his last musical work, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 94 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.         The family said she died after a stroke.         Mrs. Bernstein collaborated with her son on "Arias and Barcarolles," a song cycle that received a Grammy Award in 1991 for best contemporary composition.         Leonard Bernstein died in 1990. Mrs. Bernstein's husband, Samuel, died in 1969.         Mrs. Bernstein is survived by a daughter, Shirley Anne Bernstein of New York, a son, Burton Bernstein of Bridgewater, Conn., and five grandchildren.       
         Harriett Swenney Crowley, a retired editor who was also an administrator of American aid to third world countries, died Dec. 16 in Hendersonville, N.C. She was 79.         She died after a stroke, a son, Peter Howard Crowley, said.         Early in World War II she worked for the Office of War Information.         From 1943 to 1946, she was an editor at The New York Times. She then joined with Eleanor Darnton in establishing the Women's National News Service, a daily news syndicate.         In 1958, she shifted careers and became director of the Center for International Economic Growth in Washington. She later served as an adminstrator for the United States Agency for International Development.         In addition to her son Peter, of Cleveland, she is survived by two other sons, Kenneth Michael Crowley of Durham, N.C., and Leonard Kay Crowley of Arlington, Va.       
         Ruth Lynch Saunders, a psychoanalyst and a former magazine editor, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and also lived in Siasconset, Mass.         Mrs. Saunders died of cancer, said her son, Anthony D. Saunders, of Stamford, N.Y.         Mrs. Saunders received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1949, a master's degree from Columbia University School of Social Work in 1976, and a certificate in psycholanalytic training from the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in 1979. She was a psychoanalyst at the institute at the time of her death. Her specialty was anorexia and bulimia.         She was an editor for The Saturday Review of Literature from 1960 to 1965, and McCall's from 1965 to 1967.         Mrs. Saunders's husband, Frank, died in 1989.         In addition to her son, Anthony, Mrs. Saunders is survived by two stepsons, Michael T. of Toronto, and Mark F. of the Bronx; two stepdaughters, Joan S. Markham of Yonkers, and Frances S. Hoffman of Mercersville, N.J., and six grandchildren.       
         Fannie Bear Besser, who at the age of 20 became one of New Jersey's first female lawyers and did legal work until she was 90, died on Friday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, N.J. She was 92 years old and lived in East Orange, N.J.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Besser, who grew up in Newark, went directly from high school to the New Jersey Law School, now a part of Rutgers University. She enrolled there because it was the only school where she could attend night classes while working days, as a secretary.         She graduated first in her class, at age 20. Because she was under 21, she had to receive special permission from the state's chief justice to take the bar examination.         After practicing general law for four years, she left her career to have her children and rear them.         In the late 1930's she returned to legal work as a volunteer lawyer for various agencies: the New Jersey Board of Mediation, the Army's Legal Department, the Governor's Commission for Refugees after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Governor's Landlord-Tenant Committee in the 1960's.         In 1968 she became a full-time volunteer lawyer at the Essex-Newark Legal Services in Orange. There she advised and represented elderly people until her health failed 18 months ago.         Her work was honored by two Army commendations, a New Jersey State Bar award in 1986 and Governor Thomas Kean's Humanitarian of the Year Award in 1989. In 1990, the Rutgers Law School Alumni Association created the Fannie Bear Besser award for public service. She was the first recipient.         She was married for 56 years to Hyman Besser, who founded an accounting firm in Newark. He died 14 years ago.         Surviving are her son, Albert G., of South Orange; two daughters, Edith Segall of Harrison, N.Y., and Ann Scott of Windsor, Maine; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 11, 1992, Friday         An obituary on Sunday about one of the first female lawyers in New Jersey rendered her last name incorrectly in some editions. She was Fannie Bear Besser.       
         Lois Braun, a member of the board of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues, died yesterday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her husband, Julian, said.         Mrs. Braun, a graduate of Hunter College, was active for many years in Reform Jewish organizations. She was a director and a former president of the National Federation of Temple Sisterhood II, a past president and trustee of the Larchmont Temple Sisterhood and a past president and trustee of the Larchmont chapter of Hadassah.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Andrew, of Longmont, Colo.; two daughters, Laurie Braun of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Carol Shutzer of Swampscott, Mass.; a brother, Bruce F. Roberts of Purchase, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Helen Callaghan Candaele St. Aubin, the speedy outfielder whose swing won one batting title and inspired two movies about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died Tuesday night at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., at age 69. She died of breast cancer, according to her son Kelly Candaele, whose 1988 documentary about his mother's career, "A League of Their Own," inspired last summer's movie of the same name.         During her four seasons in the women's league that was formed in 1943 as a wartime alternative to the talent-depleted men's league, Mrs. St. Aubin, who played under her original name, Helen Callaghan, batted .257 and stole 354 bases in 388 games.         Mrs. St. Aubin was a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, who had been recruited at a Canadian softball tournament. Accompanied by her sister, Margie, who was sent by their father to keep an eye on her, she broke in with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes in 1944 and was an immediate star. She stole 112 bases in 111 games, and her .287 batting average was the league's second highest.         In 1945, when the team moved to Indiana and became the Fort Wayne Daisies, Mrs. St. Aubin, a left-handed batter, led the league with a .299 average and in extra-base hits (24), doubles (17) and home runs (3).         She became ill in 1946 and sat out the 1947 season before returning for part of the 1948 season, her last, and she was never again as sharp at the plate. But she stole 114 bases in 111 games in 1946.         Her former teammate Dottie Collins recalled yesterday how deceptive her appearance was on the field.         "When she was playing -- running or throwing -- she looked so dainty, that's the only word for it," said Mrs. Collins, who recalled the 5-foot-1 1/4-inch, 115-pound outfielder as a "tiny" woman who was "strong."         According to Mrs. Collins, the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, Mrs. St. Aubin's stance and swing are almost perfectly preserved in her son Casey Candaele, a switch-hitting infielder for the Houston Astros.         She married Bobby Candaele during her career and gave birth to the first of their five sons before the 1948 season. They settled in Lompoc, Calif., where she became a cleaning staff supervisor at a local hospital. She and Mr. Candaele were eventually divorced, and she later married Ronald J. St. Aubin.         The documentary Kelly Candaele and his friend Kim Wilson made in 1988 led directly to the movie starring Geena Davis and directed by Penny Marshall.         In addition to her husband, her sister, who is now Margaret Maxwell of Vancouver, and her sons Kelly and Casey, Mrs. St. Aubin is survived by a brother, Lou; two other sisters, Pearl McInnis and Kay Morrison; three other sons, Ricky, the former head football coach at the University of California at Santa Barbara; Rocky, a telephone company employee, and Kelly's twin brother, Kerry, a Richard Hofstadter fellow in history at Columbia University, plus three grandchildren.
