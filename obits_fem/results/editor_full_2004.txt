         Dr. Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist and self-help author whose books touched on identity, resolving stress and the grief occasioned by the World Trade Center attacks, died on Jan. 10 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. She was 55.         The cause was respiratory failure after pneumonia, said her husband, Steven Fink.         One of her books, ''The Type E Woman,'' published in 1986, described the stresses of balancing a career and family. Dr. Braiker's literary agent, Alice Martel, said the ''E'' represented the woman who tried to be ''everything to everybody.'' The book was a response to research into the Type A personality so often associated with hard-driving men. It was Dr. Braiker's favorite through the years, Mr. Fink said.         In another book, ''The Disease to Please,'' she described a destructive propensity that drives people, usually women, to serve others to the detriment of their own well-being.         In the introduction to ''The September 11 Syndrome,'' published four months after the 2001 attacks, she described the premise of the book as helping readers turn ''our collective emotional adversity'' into their own psychological victories. The book prescribed steps to control feelings of helplessness and anxiety awakened by terrorism.         Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who met Dr. Braiker in graduate school, said she ''brought an extremely strong theoretical background to popular writing.''         ''Her books took problems that were common and subliminal and put them out in the open,'' Dr. Jamison said.         Harriet Beryl Braiker was born in Los Angeles. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and won a National Science Foundation research scholarship. In 1975, she received a doctorate in clinical and social psychology from U.C.L.A.         Before establishing a private practice in 1980, Dr. Braiker worked at the RAND Corporation, analyzing health policies for the federal government. She later became a contributing editor for Working Woman and a columnist for Lear's magazine. She also appeared on television and radio talk shows and was an expert witness in legal cases on sexual harassment.         Although her earliest works examined alcoholism, depression and destructive relationships, her most recent book, ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?'' (2003), was a study of manipulation.         In addition to her husband, surviving are their daughter, Amanda Fink, also of Pasadena; a stepson, Stuart, of New York; and a brother, Dr. Barry Braiker of Beverly Hills, Calif.       
         Charlotte Zwerin, a documentary filmmaker known for insightful depictions of visual and performing artists like Christo, Willem de Kooning, Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Lisa Tesone said.         Ms. Zwerin worked for many years with David and Albert Maysles, early practitioners of the documentary genre known as cinéma vérité, which uses a small camera to capture the drama of daily experience. Her editing for them was of such quality that they gave her credit as the third director of well-known films like ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), an account of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour of the United States.         It was her decision to include the band members' reactions to the killing of a fan on the stage of a concert at the Altamont Speedway in Livermore, Calif., the site of the tour's last concert.         ''The real hero of the making of the film was Charlotte Zwerin, who edited it and got a directing credit,'' Stephen Lighthill, a cameraman, said in an interview with Salon.com. ''I was stunned with what she got out of my footage. She compressed it and gave you a sense of a buildup of tragedy that you otherwise wouldn't have.''         Other films she did with the Maysleses included ''Salesman'' (1969), an account of four real-life sales representatives of the American Bible Company, and ''Running Fence'' (1978), a chronicle of the successful efforts of the artist Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, to erect a 24-mile fabric fence in the California hills.         Her own films included ''Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser'' (1989), which contained rarely seen clips of the brilliant and eccentric jazz pianist; ''Arshile Gorky'' (1982), a profile of the abstract painter; ''Sculpture of Spaces: Noguchi'' (1995); ''American Masters -- Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live For'' (1999), a biography narrated by Tony Bennett; and ''Toru Takemitsu: Music for the Movies'' (1994), an examination of the Japanese composer. The Museum of Modern Art had a retrospective of her works last year.         Charlotte Mitchell was born on Aug. 15, 1931, in Detroit and developed her affection for film and music as a child by attending an entertainment event in Detroit called ''Big Band and a Movie.'' First came a live band, then the film, she said in an interview with The New York Times last year.         She attended Wayne State University, where she established a film society before moving to New York and finding work as a librarian at CBS for its documentary series ''The 20th Century.'' She slowly worked her way up to editor, then joined Drew Associates, where Robert Drew was pioneering ''direct cinema,'' as cinéma vérité was also called. She met the Maysleses at Drew.         She told The Times she stopped working with the Maysleses because they would not let her produce. ''They cast an awful long shadow, and it came time for me to get out of it,'' she said.         On her own films she became known for a personal signature characterized by innovative editing. Leonard Feather, a critic for The Los Angeles Times, said that her film on Monk provided ''a closer glance behind the veil of this half-hidden, exotically gifted figure than could ever be observed during his sadly aborted career.''         Ms. Zwerin was divorced from Michael Zwerin, a jazz critic. She is survived by her brother, Charles Mitchell, and sister, Margaret Tesone, both of Detroit.         Correction:  January 31, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the documentary film maker Charlotte Zwerin on Tuesday misstated the location of the fatal stabbing of a fan at a 1969 Rolling Stones concert shown in ''Gimme Shelter,'' a film she edited. It occurred in front of the stage, not onstage.       
         Dr. Gertie F. Marx, a New York anesthesiologist who helped advance the use of modern epidural injections that ease women's pain during childbirth, died on Sunday at the Schervier Nursing Care Center in the Bronx, according to Dr. Jill M. Rabin, a friend and colleague. Dr. Marx was 91.         At a time when anesthesia was reserved for complicated deliveries and Caesarean sections, Dr. Marx became an early and vigorous advocate of what became known as the epidural and helped show that it was safe and effective. The procedure places a catheter next to a patient's spine, allowing a sedative to block the sensation of pain without paralyzing the birth canal.         Dr. Marx worked at Beth Israel Hospital for more than a decade before joining the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in 1955. For the next four decades, she continued her clinical practice and research at Einstein. She developed an epidural needle that bears her name and became the founding editor of Obstetric Anesthesia Digest, the original publication in the field.         Before Dr. Marx, a doctor might or might not have given sedation or pain relief in childbirth, said Dr. Paul L. Goldiner, chairman of the anesthesiology department at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. ''She single-handedly pushed the development of obstetric anesthesiology as a specialty.''         Gertie Florentine Marx was born in Frankfurt and left Germany in the 1930's, after the Nazi government began to deny Jews entrance to universities. She received her medical degree from the University of Bern, in Switzerland, in 1937, before immigrating to the United States.         Dr. Marx later married Eric Reiss, a radiological technician whom she had met in Germany, said Dr. Goldiner. Mr. Reiss died in the 1960's, and the couple had no children.         In 1993, Dr. Marx was awarded a College Medal from the Royal College of Anaesthetists, in a presentation made by Queen Elizabeth II. She was a fellow of the American College of Anesthesiologists and an associate fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She received a distinguished service award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.         Dr. Marx became a professor emerita at Einstein in 1995, and spent most of her time at home in Southbury, Conn., before recently moving to an assisted-living facility there.         She is survived by a cousin, Dr. Ronald Simon of New York, and by her close friend and former student, Dr. Rabin, also of New York.       
         Joan Delano Aiken, a prodigious weaver of tales for adults and children, died on Sunday at her home in Petworth, in West Sussex, England. She was 79.         Her death was announced by Brandt & Hochman, her literary agents, in New York.         Ms. Aiken's fiction could have a Dickensian atmosphere, evoke a somewhat skewed history of Olde England or be straightforward.         Much of it was in her chosen genre: nonhistorical adventure, tinged with suspense and horror, often featuring ghosts.         Her most famous book, ''The Wolves of Willoughby Chase,'' illustrated by Pat Marriott, appeared in 1962 and became an evergreen. It tells of two girls in a great English country house, and it leavens suspenseful Victorian melodrama with tongue-in-cheek humor.         Recommended for children in Grades 5 to 9, it was also turned into dramatic versions staged in many schools. Charles Schlesinger, an agent at Brandt & Hochman, said the book sold many thousands of copies every year in English and various translations; it is still in print in the 1987 Delacorte edition.         Mr. Schlesinger said that what is apparently her final book, ''The Witch of Clatteringshaws,'' is scheduled for publication by Delacorte next January. Her first, ''All You've Ever Wanted and Other Stories,'' was published 50 years ago.         In between she wrote more than 100 books, with ''Bone and Dream,'' ''The Scream,'' ''Ghostly Beasts,'' ''In Thunder's Pocket'' and ''Lady Catherine's Necklace,'' all published in Britain since 2000. As of last count, 29 of her books were in print in the United States.         Her ''Arabel's Raven'' series of humorous adventures, most of them also published in the United States, was adapted for television by the BBC. Her adult novels included mysteries and what she called her Jane Austen sequence, which included ''Mansfield Revisited'' (Doubleday, 1985), and ''Jane Fairfax: Jane Austen's Emma Through Another's Eyes'' (St. Martin's, 1991), a sequel to the Austen novel.         Joan Aiken was born in Rye, England, a daughter of the American poet Conrad Aiken and his first wife, Jessie McDonald. Having decided on a literary career early in life, she published some poetry in a prestigious little magazine but found that prose paid better.         She developed her story writing while working for the BBC and the Information Ministry during and just after World War II. She met her first husband, Ronald George Brown, a journalist, during that period.         They married in 1945 and had two children, John S. Brown and Elizabeth D. Charlaff, who survive her, along with Ms. Aiken's sister, Jane A. Hodge, and two grandchildren.         After Ron Brown's death in 1955, Ms. Aiken supported herself working as a features editor for British Argosy magazine and as a copywriter for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency. After 1961 she devoted herself exclusively to writing fiction.         She also spent some years as a trans-Atlantic commuter after her second marriage, to Julius Goldstein, in 1976. An artist and former member of the Hunter College faculty, he died in 2002.         Her work earned many honors, including an Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for ''Night Fall'' (Holt, 1970). In 1999 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to children's literature.       
         Amy M. Spindler, the former fashion critic of The New York Times and style editor of its magazine, whose knowledge and fierce opinions held the world's leading designers to task and helped to raise the standard of fashion writing, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was a brain tumor, said her husband, Roberto Benabib.         Ms. Spindler was never interested in simply putting a dress on a page or talking about hemlines. She recognized that fashion was as important a cultural barometer as music or art and that it should be -- demanded to be -- covered as rigorously as a political campaign.         In an industry more accustomed to flattery and sympathetic reviews, she possessed a rare nerve, upbraiding fashion executives when she thought they were dissembling and beseeching designers to be better than they were.         ''She explained to us how we really feel about fashion,'' Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci, said yesterday from Los Angeles. ''She saw the relevance of fashion for intelligent people -- saw it in its broadest cultural context.''         And although Ms. Spindler was an early champion of Mr. Ford, she did not put on kid gloves for him. ''Even when she wrote something scathing of about one of my collections, it was constructive, not malicious or cutting,'' he said. ''It was always grounded and concrete.''         Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, whom Ms. Spindler regarded as a competitor when she became style editor of The Times Magazine, in 1998, said: ''She took criticism in a new direction. She wasn't afraid to tell the truth.''         Incensed by the fatal overdose in 1997 of Davide Sorrenti, a promising young fashion photographer, Ms. Spindler chided magazine editors for glamorizing ''heroin chic'' by depicting models in a drugged stupor. In a front-page article in The Times, Ms. Spindler wrote: ''What Mr. Sorrenti's death has revealed is that fashion photography is indeed a mirror of the tight-knit world that produces the photographs. And as long as drugs are unchecked in the industry, that image will be difficult to change.''         As a columnist and reviewer, Ms. Spindler applied her tart and witty outlook on such mid-1990's fashion trend setters as the deconstructionist Belgian designers who, after attending one of the strictest couture schools in Europe, started selling what were basically the stitched underpinnings of finished creations, and the reclamationist designers, mostly from Africa, who patched cast-off garments into novel creations. Both trends trickled into the mass market, in touches like unraveling hems, visible seams and mismatched patterns.         In a front-page article on Sept. 5, 1995, she noted a new piety on parade, marked by store windows and catalogs full of monastic robes, pilgrim's boots and dangling crosses. Perhaps, she wrote, ''the financially strained fashion industry is seeking salvation from above.''         A Midwesterner in both her mettle and plain English, Ms. Spindler was born in Michigan City, Ind. After graduating from Indiana University in 1985 with a degree in journalism, she moved to New York and worked in entry-level jobs at several Condé Nast magazines. In two years, she went from writing press releases for Bride's magazine to turning out highly detailed feature articles for The Daily News Record, the men's fashion journal of Fairchild Publications. Even in her reporting of the nuts and bolts of the garment trade, an authoritative voice -- and, equally, a sharp wit -- began to emerge.         Ms. Spindler was subsequently made associate features editor of W Europe in Paris, a city she would come to know as well as New York. In 1993, she joined The Times as a columnist on the Tuesday fashion page, where she used her training at Fairchild to engage in scoop warfare with the former colleagues at Women's Wear Daily. In 1994, The Times created the position of fashion critic for Ms. Spindler, making her an equal with the paper's other critics and acknowledging the weight of her view on a subject she not only knew in depth but also believed should be taken seriously.         In the midst of being treated for breast cancer, in 1998, she married Mr. Benabib, a television producer, whom she had met on a blind date in 1995. In the fall of 1998, after recovering from that cancer, she took the job of style editor of The Times Magazine, bringing a cultural vibrancy to the pages that had not existed before.         Her illness was not a subject she dwelled on, though she knew everything about it. She continued to supervise the coverage in the style sections and supplements of the magazine until last summer. In November, she relinquished that post and was named critic at large for culture and style.         Besides her husband, Ms. Spindler is survived by her mother, Sally Spindler of Tampa, Fla., and a sister, Bonnie, of San Francisco.       
         Gail Hall Zarr, a former managing editor of the Zagat Surveys series of  restaurant, hotel and travel guides, died last Saturday at her home in  Manhattan. She was 50.         The cause was complications of uterine cancer, said her husband, Gary Zarr. Mrs. Zarr began working at Zagat in 1994, rising to managing editor from senior editor. She developed new guides and oversaw the publication. ''She was responsible for more than 60 books, and was one of the key people in building our editorial group,'' said Tim Zagat, the company's publisher.         After leaving Zagat in 2001, she wrote a Barnes & Noble guide, ''Getting Into College'' (2003).         A 1975 graduate of New York University, Mrs. Zarr received a masters degree in English literature there in 1985. She was formerly the director of publications for the fundraising campaign at Barnard College and a public relations associate at the New York Public Library.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Daniel; a daughter, Emily; her mother, Linda Hall of Jefferson, N.Y.; and a sister, Debra Hall of New York City.       
         Lisa Gubernick, an author and reporter who wrote about the entertainment industry for The Wall Street Journal and as the Hollywood correspondent for Forbes magazine, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 48 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was colon cancer, said Laurie Cohen, a family friend.         Ms. Gubernick began her career writing about finance. She became a senior writer at The American Lawyer in 1984 and started its spinoff newsletter Takeover Control Alert. She joined Forbes in July 1984, was its Hollywood correspondent from 1987 to 1990, and became a senior editor in 1990. She joined The Journal in 1998, covering entertainment for its Weekend Journal section.         She wrote ''Squandered Fortune: The Life and Times of Huntington Hartford'' (Putnam, 1991) and ''Get Hot or Go Home: Trisha Yearwood, The Making of a Nashville Star'' (Morrow, 1993).         Ms. Gubernick was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College.         She is survived by her mother, Grace, of Manhattan; her husband, Paul Fishleder, an editor at The New York Times; and her daughter, Lily.       
         Emily Morison Beck, the self-described literary archaeologist who edited three editions of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, mining sources from sea chanteys to Shakespeare, died on Sunday at her home in Canton, Mass. She was 88.         The cause was kidney failure, her son Gordon M. Beck said.         Mrs. Beck brought an august intellectual heritage, an elephantine memory and bristling energy to refining, enlarging and, sometimes, subtracting from a reference book that few libraries are without.         In the 13th, 14th and 15th editions, appearing in 1955, 1968 and 1980, Mrs. Beck gradually added feminist voices, the singers James Brown and Bob Dylan and the first words spoken on the moon, while remedying past omissions, like that of Dickens's ''Bah! Humbug!'' Excerpts from what she called ''members of the crappy poetry society,'' particularly those who favored nature poems, bit the dust. Robert Lowell was given a new and quite large voice in her Bartlett's. She expanded the entries from Shakespeare and the Bible, the staples since John Bartlett, a bookstore employee in Cambridge, Mass., decided to publish the quotations that he had been collecting in a notebook. But Mr. Bartlett might have been startled by a phrase from the Watergate scandal that appeared in the 15th edition, published in 1980: ''Expletive deleted,'' not to mention ''E.T., phone home.''         Some critics complained that the whole enterprise had become hopelessly arbitrary. Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1981, James Atlas compared the 15th edition of Bartlett's to the 10th anniversary issue of Rolling Stone.         ''It is strange to find on the stately double-columned pages words to songs I listened to while sitting in the parking lot of an A & W root beer stand on Friday nights in high school,'' Mr. Atlas wrote.         Others praised Mrs. Beck's boldness, even down to including an Emerson quotation criticizing quotations: ''I hate quotations,'' it reads, ''Tell me what you know.''         Mrs. Beck's extensive cross-referencing led to many refinements. For example, she traced Kaufman and Hart's ''You Can't Take It With You'' to the ancient Egyptians, the Bible and Theognis, a Greek poet.         Emily Marshall Morison was born on Oct. 15, 1915, in Boston, one of four children of Samuel Eliot Morison, the historian, and Elizabeth Greene Shaw. Newsweek noted in 1990 that she gave as much space to quotations from her father as to those from Herodotus and Thucydides.         Nicknamed Wendy after the character in Peter Pan, she was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, England, the Concord Academy in Massachusetts and Radcliffe. She worked as an editor for Harper & Brothers and Alfred A. Knopf, and in 1946 married Brooks Beck, one of the first lawyers to represent authors in their negotiations with publishers. When he joined a law firm in Boston, she got a job with Atlantic Monthly Press, editing books.         In 1952 she was given a leave by Atlantic Monthly to help edit the centennial edition of Bartlett's, which was published by Little, Brown in 1955. In the preface she was cited for her ''highly competent and critical service'' but not singled out as the book's editor. During the preparation of that book, she wrote memo after memo, some of which made the case for keeping some of Shakespeare's most famous passages. She thus became the obvious choice to edit the next edition of the book, the 14th, which was published in 1968.         Her pursuit of the origins of quotations was dogged and often ingenious. In stalking a Henry James phrase she wanted to include in the 15th edition, she considered skimming his entire works, but chanced upon a magazine article about Truman Capote that attributed the lines to ''The Middle Years,'' an autobiography of James.         She read the entire book and could not find the lines. Then she noticed a little editor's note at the very end, saying James had taken the title from his short story of the same name. She got a complete collection of James's stories and found the quotation on the next to last page.         ''We work in the dark -- we do what we can -- we give what we have,'' it read. ''Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.''         Mr. Beck died in 1969. Mrs. Beck is survived by her sister, Catharine Cooper, of Islington, England; her sons Cameron, of Canton, and Gordon, of Larchmont, N.Y.; her daughter, Emily M. Beck, of Larchmont; and three grandchildren.         Her helpers on Bartlett's ranged far beyond the academic experts hired by Little, Brown. The organist at her church told her that the correct title of Thomas Grey's poem was ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,'' not ''Elegy in a Country Churchyard,'' as every edition since John Bartlett had claimed.         Mrs. Beck corrected the error in the 14th.         Correction:  April 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Emily Morison Beck, editor of three editions of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, misspelled the surname of the poet who wrote ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.'' (Its title had been misstated in Bartlett's, and Mrs. Beck corrected it on advice from the organist at her church.) The poet was Thomas Gray, not Grey.         The obituary also misstated the timing of the book's inclusion of the quotation ''E.T., phone home.'' It occurred after 1982, when the movie ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' appeared, not in the 1980 edition.       
         Vivian Infantino, a longtime columnist for the trade weekly Footwear News who helped discover many shoe designers, died on Saturday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice in Manhattan. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, Footwear News said.         Ms. Infantino started writing a column called ''Viewpoints'' in the 1960's. Among the shoemakers whose careers she helped were Kenneth Cole, Stuart Weitzman and Manolo Blahnik.         Footwear News is a sister of WWD at Fairchild Publications. A weekly, founded in 1945, it covers the market for footwear, accessories and related leather items.         Ms. Infantino was born in Brooklyn and joined the company in 1949 after graduating from the College of St. Elizabeth.         After some time as an assistant editor in the 1950's, she was Footwear's fashion editor for more than 30 years, until she retired from full-time work and became fashion director at large in 1996. .         Ms. Infantino left no immediate survivors.       
         Mary McGrory, an unapologetic liberal who chronicled 50 years of scandal, war, Congressional turmoil and political heartbreak as a columnist for The Washington Star and The Washington Post, died on Wednesday at George Washington University Hospital. She was 85.         Ms. McGrory won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1975 for her columns on Watergate. But her career had a remarkable range, from the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, where she first made her name, to the Bush administration and the war with Iraq, which she opposed in her final foreboding columns in March 2003. She suffered a stroke that month and did not return to her column. She had been in declining health ever since, said her nephew, Ted McGrory.         The daughter of a scholarly Boston postal clerk, Ms. McGrory was raised on Latin, poetry and a profoundly Irish love of the game of politics. She covered virtually every presidential campaign since 1956, drawn to their ''endless possibility,'' she once said. Her columns captured some of the greatest political characters of the era -- their loyalty, treachery, weaknesses, sacrifices, high causes and low moments.         She wrote a series of columns about the assassination and funeral of President John F. Kennedy that became one of the most evocative and enduring eulogies for the man and the times.         ''He was just home from the Pacific when I first saw him in 1946,'' she wrote. ''He was thin as a match and still yellow from malaria. But he was blithe and determined and wherever he went he was surrounded by young men who felt with him that the Irish had something more to give to American political life than a last hurrah.''         She was at the airport when Kennedy's body was flown back from Dallas, and she described the tearful, ''leaderless men of the New Frontier'' as they ''picked up their inexpressible burden'' of the young president's coffin. She then wrote a powerfully spare account of his funeral:         ''His old friend, Cardinal Cushing of Boston, who married him, baptized his children and prayed over him in the icy air of his inaugural, said a Low Mass. At the final prayers, after the last blessing, he suddenly added, 'dear Jack.' ''         Across the generations, Ms. McGrory was a fixture on Capitol Hill, summoning House members off the floor for a chat in the speaker's lobby, showing up every Tuesday to grab senators after their weekly party caucuses. She called Congress the ''federal entertainment center,'' and said she vastly preferred it to covering the White House, where ''there are all those courtiers,'' ''so full of themselves,'' who ''may or may not call you back.''         She wrote a column steeped in reporting at a time when other columnists increasingly focused on attitude, analysis and television appearances, and she did her own legwork well into her 80's.         ''I can't do it any other way,'' Ms. McGrory once said. ''I have to see, I have to hear. I'm primitive, I guess. I don't want anyone else doing my listening or watching for me.''         Her second cousin Brian McGrory, a columnist with The Boston Globe, recalled, ''She was hellbent on making sure every column was reported, hellbent on being out on the campaign trail, even when physically it wasn't the easiest thing for her.''         Nothing made her happier, Mr. McGrory added, than being in the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer outside Manchester, N.H., when it functioned as a roiling intelligence center for politicians and journalists covering the New Hampshire primary.         Ms. McGrory was a ground-breaking woman in American newspapers, often the only woman or one of a very few on the campaign trail in her early days. But she played down the notion that this was always, necessarily, a hardship. A woman who increasingly acquired the manner of an aging countess, as her friend Phil Gailey, editor of editorials at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida put it, she was legendary on the campaign trail for enlisting male reporters as her porters.         In his memoir ''A Good Life,'' Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, wrote: ''In the 60's I had been allowed to carry her bags and typewriter during the presidential campaign. We were known as McGrory's bearers.'' Several generations of bearers followed after him.         Her path to political reporting was not easy. A graduate of Boston's elite Girls' Latin School and Emmanuel College, Ms. McGrory got her start as secretary to the book editor of The Boston Herald Traveler. She also wrote book reviews and the kind of features she called ''dog stories,'' but she was ''crazy'' about newspapering and felt stymied, Ms. McGrory said in an oral history for the Washington Press Club Foundation.         She moved to The Washington Star as a book reviewer in 1947. She got her big break in 1954, when her editor, Newbold Noyes, sent her to Capitol Hill to cover the Army-McCarthy hearings. He urged her to write her stories as if she were writing a letter to a favorite aunt. She thought of her Aunt Sarah, ''a very nice, lonely person in our family,'' she said later, and a genre was born. She viewed Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, she said, as ''an Irish bully,'' a type she had seen before.         ''For eight days,'' she wrote in an early column, ''the Army secretary has been having his honesty questioned, his motives impugned and his patriotism challenged. He has been bullied, baited and patronized. He has been treated like a stubborn and not very bright child. Throughout his ordeal, moreover, he has been subjected to the rather jostling familiarity of Senator McCarthy, who calls him 'Bob.' ''         Ms. McGrory went on to cover all the classic Congressional dramas, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. ''Nothing that Bill Clinton did in the matter of Monica Lewinsky shows any class or character,'' she wrote, but added: ''The Republicans are beyond reason. They are like people on New Year's Eve, determined to have a wild time, no matter the cost.''         She was intensely loyal to The Star, and while The Washington Post tried to woo her many times over the years, she did not make the move until The Star closed in 1981. Post editors often joked they were always second best to Ms. McGrory.         In 1998, when accepting the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award, Ms. McGrory described her view of a Mary McGrory column. ''No great men call me,'' she said, proudly. ''You know who calls me? Losers. I am their mark.'' She added, ''If you want to abolish land mines. If you want to reform campaign spending'' or ''if you want to save children from abuse, or stupid laws, or thickheaded judges, you have my telephone number.''         ''All the places of little hope, that's my constituency,'' she said.         The Vietnam War was her great passion, and it framed her coverage of the 1968 presidential campaign, particularly the insurgent antiwar candidacy of Eugene J. McCarthy. But she ranged widely, with judgments that were often withering. Senator Edward M. Kennedy said ruefully, ''As Bobby once said, 'Mary is so gentle until she gets behind a typewriter.' ''         In a column about Richard M. Nixon's 1962 news conference after he lost the California governor's race, Ms. McGrory wrote: ''For Richard M. Nixon, it was exit snarling.'' She later made the Nixon administration's famous enemies list.         Ms. McGrory did not marry or have children, but had a large extended family, including two nieces, in addition to her nephew; a loyal group of Washington Star veterans; and a longtime relationship as the ultimate volunteer with St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home.         She was also a hostess of some renown. Mr. Gailey remembers one McGrory party in 1982, a christening for his son, that featured Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. singing, ''If you're Irish, come into the parlor,'' while a Reagan White House aide, Michael K. Deaver, accompanied him on the piano.         When she accepted her press club award in 1998, Ms. McGrory declared, ''I should confess that I always felt a little sorry for people who didn't work for newspapers.''       
         Carolyn Lelyveld, who directed a pioneering Bronx day care center for children with AIDS from the poorest neighborhoods and founded programs for children with cancer in hospitals in South Africa under apartheid, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death resulted from complications of breast cancer, said her husband, Joseph Lelyveld, former executive editor of The New York Times.         Ms. Lelyveld's work with AIDS children, at Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, took place from 1987-94. The center was the only one in the city. Its children were picked up by bus each school day, and the center maintained a food pantry for their families, mostly single-parent households headed by women with AIDS.         Earlier Ms. Lelyveld directed day care centers in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and on Capitol Hill in Washington. She then joined programs that prepared children for difficult medical procedures and attended to their nonmedical needs, first at Downstate Medical Center and then at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.         From 1981-83, she founded parallel programs for children with cancer at Baragwanath Hospital in the township of Soweto, the largest black hospital in South Africa at the time, and at a white hospital, Johannesburg General. Embraced by black nurses, the Soweto program continued for some years.         Born in New York, Ms. Lelyveld attended Brandeis University and graduated from the School of General Studies at Columbia. She earned a master's degree at the Bank Street College of Education.         For a decade, until last summer, Ms. Lelyveld coordinated a project for The New York Times Company Foundation to enrich the resources of Public School 111, the Adolph S. Ochs School, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her work greatly expanded the library and put pupils into continuing contact with leading cultural institutions, including the American Museum of Natural History and the International Center of Photography.         Besides her husband, Ms. Lelyveld is survived by her daughters, Amy Lelyveld of New York and Nita Lelyveld of Los Angeles; one granddaughter; and her sisters, Susan Mermelstein of Newton, Mass., and Annie Fox of Brooklyn.       
         Elizabeth Shub, a distinguished editor and translator of children's books from German and Yiddish, especially those of Isaac Bashevis Singer, whom she knew from her childhood and encouraged to write for children, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Her death was announced by Virginia Duncan, the publisher of Greenwillow Books.         Mrs. Shub (pronounced SHOOB) was born in Poland and was brought to New York in 1919. Her father, Samuel Charney, also known as Shmuel Niger, was the literary critic for The Day, a Yiddish newspaper, and he and his wife ran a literary salon in their home in New York.         Mrs. Shub's younger brother, Dr. William Charney, a microbiologist, was known for his work on the development of prednisone and prednisolone, the synthetic corticosteroids.         After she and her husband, Boris Shub, divorced, she drifted into publishing. The couple had no children.         Mrs. Shub was first hired by Susan Hirschman as a freelance reader in the children's department at Harper & Row. She became an associate editor there before moving to Charles Scribner's Sons, then followed Mrs. Hirschman to the children's book department at Macmillan. When Mrs. Hirschman founded Greenwillow Books in 1974, Mrs. Shub became senior editor, a position she held until her retirement in 1996. In the 1960's, when she was an established editor, she suggested to Singer that he consider writing for children. ''Zlateh the Goat, and Other Stories'' appeared in 1966 and was followed by 10 other children's books.         In addition to translating folk tales and Yiddish stories for children, she wrote several children's books herself, including ''The White Stallion'' (1982), a popular novel..         In a published interview she said that as both an editor and a writer she had respect for writers' instincts, and that ''if I make suggestions on how something in a manuscript might be changed, I always let the writers fix it their own way.''       
         Myra Waldo, a writer who filled bookshelves with advice on places to see and their cuisines, died Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 88 and formerly lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         Starting in the mid-1950's, Ms. Waldo wrote more than two dozen travel guides and cookbooks, which she periodically updated. Her ''Serve at Once: The Soufflé Cookbook'' of 1954, for instance, was revised as ''The Soufflé Cookbook'' in 1961 and, reissued in 1990, remains in print. A book she wrote in 1955 with the actress Gertrude Berg, ''The Molly Goldberg Cookbook,'' based on Ms. Berg's famous television character, was reissued most recently in 1999.         Myra Waldo was born in Manhattan and attended Columbia University. In 1937 she married Robert J. Schwartz, a lawyer, who died in 1997. She used her maiden name professionally.         Ms. Waldo worked on special projects for the Macmillan Publishing Company in the late 1960's. From 1968 to 1972, she was on the air as food and travel editor of WCBS radio, a job that led to her 1971 ''Restaurant Guide to New York City and Vicinity,'' which she continued to revise into the 1980's.         Her first book, as editor, was ''The Complete Round-the-World Cookbook,'' featuring recipes gathered by Pan American Airways (Doubleday, 1954, revised 1973).         There followed books about Roman, Northern Italian, Spanish and Asian food, about meals at restaurants that accepted the Diners Club card, and others about barbecues and desserts and cooking with wine. She wrote ''The International Encyclopedia of Cooking'' and ''The Dictionary of International Food and Cooking Terms'' (Macmillan, 1967).         Ms. Waldo's travel guides to Europe were each updated several times. She later added guides to South America, the South Pacific and Japan. She was a consultant to airlines and hotels.         Ms. Waldo is survived by her sister, Naomi Waldo Holtzman of Oakland, Calif.         Correction:  August 4, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Myra Waldo, an author of travel guides and cookbooks, gave an incomplete title for a book she wrote with the actress Gertrude Berg. It was ''The Molly Goldberg Jewish Cookbook,'' not ''The Molly Goldberg Cookbook.''       
         Corrine Grad Coleman, a founding member of the Redstockings, a women's liberation group in New York, died on July 4 at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.         The cause was heart disease, said her daughter, Patricia Coleman.         Redstockings, a play on bluestockings but with the color of revolution, was an offshoot of New York Radical Women, founded in 1968, whose members included Ms. Coleman. In the same year, New York Radical Women organized the first protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City.         Redstockings, a radical feminist group founded by Shulamith Firestone and Ellen Willis, first appeared in 1969 at a New York City legislative hearing on abortion law reform, when several women tried to take the microphone from the scheduled speakers: 12 men and a nun.         Redstockings held its own abortion ''speak out'' soon afterward at the Washington Square Methodist Church, where members used consciousness-raising techniques to testify about abortion in terms of their own experience.         Ms. Coleman was also one of the leaders of a daylong occupation of the Ladies' Home Journal editorial office by more than 100 feminists in 1970. The women demanded a chance to put out a ''liberated'' issue and the replacement of the editor and publisher, John Mack Carter. The magazine, which had a circulation of 6.9 million, agreed to let the women publish a special section.         Ms. Coleman, a freelance writer, was one of the editors of the Redstockings Manifesto and an editor of ''Feelings: A Journal of Women's Liberation.'' Her writing was published in ''Feelings'' as well as in ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975,'' by Alice Echols (University of Minnesota Press, 1989), The Brooklyn Phoenix and The Village Voice.         Corrine Grad was born on June 30, 1927, in the Bronx. She received a bachelor's and a master's degree from New York University. Her marriage to Joseph K. Coleman ended in divorce in 1977, and he died in 1991.         In addition to her daughter Patricia, of Manhattan, Ms. Coleman is survived by three other children: Amy and Anthony Coleman, both of Manhattan, and Nathaniel Coleman of Newcastle, England; and two grandchildren.         Correction:  July 19, 2004, Monday  An obituary of the radical feminist and writer Corinne Grad Coleman on July 11 misstated her connection to the book ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975,'' by Alice Echols (University of Minnesota Press, 1989). While Ms. Coleman was interviewed and quoted for the book, her own writing does not appear in it.       
         Frances Hansen, a self-described housewife who marshaled imagination -- surely not malice -- to make crossword puzzles she constructed more puzzling by using her own poems as clues, died on Friday at a hospital in Perth Amboy, N.J. She was 85.         The cause was complications of a stroke, Betty Lee Solley, her niece, said.         The New York Times published 82 of Mrs. Hansen's puzzles, with the 83rd scheduled for the Christmas issue of the paper's Sunday magazine. She had written every Christmas puzzle since 1995 and had become the second most prolific living writer of Sunday puzzles and the fourth most published of all time.         The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and book publishers like Dell, Random House and Simon & Schuster also printed puzzles she constructed.         Will Shortz, The New York Times crossword puzzle editor, said Mrs. Hansen ''caused a sensation'' with her first puzzle in the paper in December 1964. The puzzle was built around Lewis Carroll's 1872 book, ''Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,'' and required potential solvers to think backward.         The clue was ''a well-known part of ykcowrebbaj, and the answer was ''ebarge out shtar emom eht dna.'' (Lewis's penchant for making up words like Jabberwocky didn't make it any easier.)         Her original limericks became her best-known trademark. Margaret Farrar, a former editor of The New York Times puzzles, at first questioned the originality of the poems because they were so good. Mrs. Hansen assuaged the editor's doubt by sending her clippings of little poems she had had printed in Good Housekeeping and other magazines.         One of Mr. Shortz's favorites goes like this:         Said W. Somerset Maugham         I shall visit the island of Guam.         If I find it is hot,         I shall leave on the spot.         I detest feeling overly waugham.         Frances Mabel Tucker was born on June 21, 1919, in Arlington, N.J., and lived in Metuchen since her childhood. She never attended college nor took any special courses. Her husband, Ernest R. Hansen, a bank president, died in 1983.         She is survived by her sons, Warren, of Forest Hills, Queens, and John, of Germantown, Tenn., and two granddaughters.         Helene Hovanec, the author of a book on crossword puzzle constructors called ''Creative Cruciverbalists'' (Morrow, 1988), said that Mrs. Hansen taught Sunday school for 12 years and noticed, when she quit, that her friends were addicted to the Sunday puzzle.         Mrs. Hansen followed suit and soon hit upon the unlikely idea that constructing puzzles might be easier than doing them because you knew all the answers. She was disabused of this notion when The Times summarily rejected her first puzzle for mistakes common to novice puzzle constructors: using two-letter words and having a very high word count.         Eight months later, her next one was accepted. Mr. Shortz said she went on to perfect her specialty within the rigor of The Times's 21 by 21 squares. Part of the challenge is to keep the black squares symmetrical, a tradition started by Mrs. Farrar because she thought they looked pretty that way.         ''She usually writes an original verse with five lines and each line is exactly 21 letters,'' Mr. Shortz said. ''Perfect rhyme and perfect meter, and it's funny besides.''         Mrs. Hansen was a leader of a group of cruciverbalists who regularly talk shop at a Manhattan restaurant and that has included the last four Times crossword puzzle editors. She organized their last meeting, last month.         In 1987, Mrs. Hansen told The Washington Post that puzzles came to her in her sleep. She said they were left by the ''idea fairy.''         Correction:  July 16, 2004, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Frances Hansen, a constructor of crossword puzzles, misstated part of the solution to a 1964 puzzle she designed around Lewis Carroll's book ''Through the Looking-Glass.'' The clue, rendered in reverse, was ''well-known part of 'Ykcowrebbaj'' (Jabberwocky). The answer, also rendered in reverse, was ''ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna'' (and the mome raths outgrabe), not ''ebarge out shtar emom eht dna.''       
         Lilian Moore, a writer of books for children, a poet and an editor who helped make children's books more affordable and worked to combat racial stereotypes in children's literature, died July 20 at her home in Seattle, said her son, Jonathan. She was 95.         A longtime resident of New York City, Ms. Moore was an editor at Scholastic when she suggested in 1957 that the company make its books more accessible by offering low-cost paperbacks through the mail; there were few paperback books for children at the time. She became the first editor of Scholastic's Arrow Book Club, a series of inexpensive editions for pupils in the fourth through sixth grades, and the Lucky Book Club, a similar program for younger readers.         Seven years later, after her stepson, Richard Moore, returned from a summer of civil-rights work in Mississippi and told her that black children there had no books about their own experience, she helped establish the Council on Interracial Books for Children. The council works to discover and encourage minority writers and to confront stereotypes in books for children.         Ms. Moore was also a prolific writer of children's books, including ''Old Rosie, the Horse Nobody Understood'' (1960).         Her ''Little Raccoon'' series, which is still in print in the United States, was translated into Russian and has sold more than 375,000 copies in Russia.         Ms. Moore began writing poetry for children in the late 1960's. In books including ''I Thought I Heard the City'' and ''Sam's Place: Poems From the Country,'' she explored her own childhood memories and wrote about the joy of finding beauty in familiar and unexpected places.         Born Lilian Levenson in the Bronx in 1909 to Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Russia, she graduated from Hunter College in 1930. Unable to find a permanent teaching job during the Depression, she joined the Unemployed Teachers Council and edited its newspaper, The Unemployed Teacher.         As a part-time teacher working with truants, she discovered her ability to help children learn to read. She eventually became a reading specialist in the New York City school system and began writing for children soon after, publishing her first stories in Humpty Dumpty's Magazine.         She is survived by a son from her second marriage, Jonathan Moore of Seattle, and a brother, Milton Levenson of Manhattan. Her third husband, Sam Reavin, died in the early 1990's. Ms. Moore's final books, ''Mural on Second Avenue, and Other City Poems'' and ''Scary Poems,'' will be published posthumously.         Correction:  August 5, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Lilian Moore, a children's author, misstated her role with Scholastic's Lucky Book Club for younger pupils. She was not its first editor; that was the writer and poet Beatrice Schenck de Regniers. (Ms. Moore was, however, the first editor of the company's Arrow Book Club, for pupils in Grades 4 to 6.)       
         Virginia Grey, who made her film debut in 1927 at the age of 10 as Little Eva in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and acted almost continuously in movies and television for the next five decades, died on July 31 in Los Angeles. She was 87.         Her death was announced by Jennifer Fagen of the public affairs department of the Motion Picture and Television Fund; she had lived at its retirement home for the last two years. Although never a box office star, Miss Grey was as indomitable as she was versatile, acting in more than 100 films and 40 television shows -- musicals, comedies, adventure films, westerns and romantic dramas. Pretty and pert, she was often a supporting player, cast as the second lead in movies dominated by Joan Crawford, Betty Grable, Susan Hayward and even the Marx Brothers (''The Big Store'' in 1941). In 1942 she was in ''Tarzan's New York Adventure'' with Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan.         In many ways, her life paralleled the history of Hollywood's film studios, first as a contract player with Metro Goldwyn Mayer, later at 20th Century Fox and at Universal under the guidance of the producer Ross Hunter.         Ann Rutherford, who acted with her in several pictures (including ''Whistling in the Dark'' with Red Skelton and ''The Hardys Ride High'' with Mickey Rooney), remembered her as ''a nifty lady.'' ''She was blond and lovely,'' she recalled. ''The camera adored her. There was not a bad angle to her face.''         The key to her success, Ms. Rutherford said, was that she was so flexible: ''She could play the girl next door or somebody's other woman. And that was what kept her working.''         Ms. Grey was born in Los Angeles and nurtured in the film industry. Her father, Ray Grey, acted in Mack Sennett's Keystone comedies and later worked as an assistant director. The Grey home was frequently visited by Hollywood hopefuls, and Ms. Grey recalled that one of her babysitters was a Sennett actress, Gloria Swanson.         After Mr. Grey died, his wife became a film editor at Universal. When she heard that the studio was casting ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' she encouraged Virginia to audition -- and she won the role.         The next year she had small roles in three more movies, then stopped acting for several years to finish her education. But from 1931 onward, she was busily at work with Mary Pickford, Busby Berkeley (''Dames'' and ''Gold Diggers of 1935'') and Wallace Beery, among others. Occasionally, she played the leading female role in MGM's B-pictures.         In 1939, she appeared in the ''Les Blondes'' chorus in ''Idiot's Delight,'' starring Clark Gable.         Ms. Grey, who was involved romantically with Gable, never married. She is survived by her sister, Lorraine Grey Heindorf, two nieces and two nephews.         After her stint at MGM, she worked in ''Stage Door Canteen,'' ''Sweet Rosie O'Grady'' (with Betty Grable), Stanley Kramer's ''So This Is New York,'' ''The Bullfighter and the Lady'' and many others. In 1955, Ross Hunter cast her in ''All That Heaven Allows'' (with Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson), followed by ''The Restless Years'' and ''Portrait in Black.'' During the 1950's and 1960's she found renewed life on television (''Bonanza,'' ''Burke's Law,'' ''Marcus Welby, M.D.''). Among her later films were ''Love Has Many Faces'' (with Lana Turner), ''Madame X'' and in 1970 ''Airport.''         Ms. Grey allowed herself to mature onscreen, accepting the character roles that prolonged her career.         And about her career, she said, pragmatically, ''I consider myself a professional who acts -- not to express my soul or elevate the cinema, but to entertain and get paid for it.''       
         Geraldine Peroni, an Academy Award-nominated film editor known for her work with Robert Altman, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan, said her sister, Pamela O'Grady. She was 51.         The New York City medical examiner's office ruled the death a suicide, but Ms. Peroni's family is disputing that finding.         Ms. Peroni was Mr. Altman's favorite editor and worked on eight of his films beginning with ''Vincent & Theo'' in 1990 and continuing through ''The Company'' last year.         She was nominated for an Oscar for her editing of ''The Player'' in 1992. She also edited Mr. Altman's ''Short Cuts,'' ''Prêt-à-Porter,'' ''Kansas City,'' ''Gingerbread Man'' and ''Dr. T and the Women.''         Over the years Mr. Altman developed a close working relationship with Ms. Peroni and often praised her work and her judgment as being an essential part of his movie making.         ''It gets to the point where I could be shooting a scene and a little bird will jump into my ear and say, 'Gerri's not going to like this,''' Mr. Altman said in a recent interview in DGA magazine, a publication of the Directors Guild of America.         Ms. Peroni was born in Manhattan and raised in Rockaway Beach, Queens.         She studied film at Hunter College, and her first job in the movies was as an editorial apprentice on the 1983 film ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.''         She was the first assistant editor, under Thelma Schoonmaker, on Martin Scorsese's ''Last Temptation of Christ'' (1988) and received her first credit as editor on ''Iron & Silk'' (1990).         She also edited ''Johnny Suede'' and ''The Safety of Objects,'' among other films.         Besides her sister, of Belle Harbor, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Peter, of Ormond Beach, Fla.       
         Fay Wray, an actress who appeared in about 100 movies but whose fame is inextricably linked with the hours she spent struggling, helplessly screaming, in the eight-foot hand of King Kong, died on Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 96.         Rick McKay, a director and her friend, said she died peacefully in her sleep. He recalled that Miss Wray's family moved to the United States from Canada in a stagecoach and said that she was possibly the longest-living true star of silent films.         As sound and color came to the movies, Miss Wray remained at the top, but it was the celebrated role that took her to the top of a very tall building that elevated her to cinematic immortality.         The huge success of ''King Kong,'' a beauty-and-the-beast film that opened in New York at both Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy in 1933, led to roles for Miss Wray in other 1930's films in which her life or her virtue, or both, were imperiled. But she was always aware that she would be remembered for the pivotal scene of ''King Kong,'' in which the giant ape carries her to the top of the Empire State Building, gently places her on a ledge, lunges furiously at fighter planes peppering him with bullets and falls to his death.         ''When I'm in New York,'' Miss Wray wrote in The New York Times in 1969, ''I look at the Empire State Building and feel as though it belongs to me, or is it vice versa?''         The most hazardous part of filming ''King Kong,'' Miss Wray recalled, was the tendency of the giant gorilla hand to loosen its grasp while she was suspended high above the set. When she felt she was about to fall, she implored the director, Merian C. Cooper, to have her lowered to the stage floor to rest a few minutes before being secured once again in the hand and sent aloft.         She spent an entire day recording additional screams, variously shrill and plaintive, that an editor later inserted in the soundtrack -- too often, she later emphasized. Asked how she was able to muster such animated cries, she replied, ''I made myself believe that the nearest possible hope of rescue was at least a mile away.''         Over the years, Miss Wray said, she came to feel that Kong had ''become a spiritual thing to many people, including me.''         In a 1987 interview, Miss Wray said she had been sent a script for the 1976 remake of ''King Kong,'' in which Jessica Lange played Kong's co-star, because its producers wanted her to play a small role. She said she disliked the script and declined the offer because ''the film I made was so extraordinary, so full of imagination and special effects, that it will never be equaled.''         Fay Wray was born on Sept. 15, 1907, on a farm in Alberta, a daughter of Jerry Wray, an inventor, and his wife, Vina. Vina Wray and her three daughters moved to Arizona by stagecoach when Fay was 3, and to Lark, Utah, when she was 5. Her father and two brothers had gone ahead.         By the time Fay was 12 or 13, her parents had separated, a sister had died of the flu, and the family was struggling financially. Fay's mother sent her to Los Angeles to live with a friend and pursue a movie career. She appeared in her first film, ''Gasoline Love,'' in 1923. She was an ingénue in a half-dozen silent westerns.         Her breakthrough came when Erich von Stroheim chose her to play the bride in his 1928 silent classic ''The Wedding March.'' Miss Wray was always drawn to writers, as she recounted in her 1989 autobiography, ''On the Other Hand.'' She was just 19 when she married John Monk Saunders, a Rhodes scholar and screenwriter known for films like ''Wings.'' She divorced him, she said, after he injected her with drugs while she slept, sold their house and their furniture and kept the money, and disappeared for a time with their baby daughter, Susan. Saunders hanged himself in 1940.         She was pursued by Sinclair Lewis and had a long romance with Clifford Odets. In 1942 she married Robert Riskin, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of ''It Happened One Night.'' They had two children, Vicki and Robert Jr. Riskin had a stroke in 1950 and died five years later. In 1971, she married Dr. Sanford Rothenberg, a neurosurgeon who had been one of Riskin's doctors. Dr. Rothenberg died in 1991.         Miss Wray retired in 1942 but made occasional movies in the 1950's and had a leading role in ''Gideon's Trumpet,'' a 1979 film with Henry Fonda. On television, she starred in a situation comedy, ''The Pride of the Family,'' from 1953 to 1955. In later years she also wrote plays that were produced in regional theaters.         Miss Wray is survived by her daughters Susan Riskin of Manhattan and Victoria Riskin of Los Angeles; her son, Robert Riskin Jr., of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.         In 1997, Miss Wray joined Julius Epstein, a writer of the film ''Casablanca,'' to testify to Congress in favor of greater copyright protection for pre-1960's film writers.         Last March Peter Jackson, the director, asked her over dinner if she would appear in his remake of ''King Kong.'' He wanted her to read the summary line, '''Twas beauty killed the beast.''         She thought that might be too confusing, said Mr. McKay, who was host at the dinner.         ''How can someone play me when I'm here?'' she asked.       
         Helen Lane, a versatile translator whose projects included works by many important Latin-American authors, died on Sunday in Albuquerque, where she had lived since returning from France 11 years ago. She was 83.         The cause was a stroke, said Ronald Christ, a friend and collaborator.         Ms. Lane, who was at home in seven languages, translated mainly from four of them: French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. At her death, she and Mr. Christ were working on a six-volume autobiography of Victoria Ocampo (1890-1979), the Argentine writer and arts patron.         Ms. Lane's career started 60 years ago when she took a job as a government translator in Los Angeles. She worked for publishers in New York before turning freelance in 1970 and moving to the Dordogne region of southwest France.         She proved her versatility with translations of Mario Vargas Llosa's memoir ''A Fish in the Water'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux; 1994); ''Essays on Mexican Art'' (Harcourt Brace, 1993), by Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet and 1990 Nobelist; and ''Caetana's Sweet Song,'' by the Brazilian novelist Nélida Piñon (Knopf, 1992).         Her work ranged from popular novels to searingly political works like ''Massacre in Mexico'' (Viking, 1975), by the French-born Mexican journalist Elena Poniatowska, whose book is a reconstructive collage of the night of Oct. 2, 1968, when the Mexican army fired on a crowd of unarmed students and other protesters. It was published first in Spanish as ''The Night of Tlatelolco.''         Ms. Lane made an impression with the English version of the Portuguese best seller ''The Three Marias: New Portuguese Letters'' (Doubleday, 1975), by Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Velho da Costa.         Among her most recent work was Juan Goytisolo's ''State of Siege'' (City Lights, 2002), a labyrinthine novel first published in Spanish in 1995, about the siege of Sarajevo.         She also translated three books by Tomás Eloy Martínez: ''The Perón Novel'' (Vintage International, 1999), ''Santa Evita'' (Knopf, 1996) and ''The Memoirs of Fray Servando Teresa de Mier'' (Oxford, 1998), a Franciscan friar's account of the early days of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.         She provided subtitles for foreign films like ''Weekend'' (1967), by Jean-Luc Godard, and ''Brazil: A Report on Torture'' (1971) by Haskell Wexler and Saul Landau.         She was born Helen Ruth Overholt in Minneapolis and graduated summa cum laude in 1943 from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she also received a master's degree in 1953. She then did postgraduate work at U.C.L.A. and at the Sorbonne.         She first went to work in 1943 in Los Angeles as a translator and editor for the United States Civil Service. In the 1950's she taught languages at U.C.L.A., Goucher College in Maryland and New York University.         From 1960 to 1970 she was a foreign editor at Grove Press in New York, for which she translated writings by, among others, Juan Bosch, Marguerite Duras, Eugene Ionesco, and Jean-François Revel. Other authors she worked on for various publishers included Maria Montessori and Curzio Malaparte.         Ms. Lane is survived by a son, Alan Michael Lane.       
         Rose Slivka, a writer, critic and editor and a major figure in the advancement of crafts as a serious artistic discipline in the United States, died on Thursday in Southampton, N.Y. She was 85 and lived in Springs, N.Y.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Charlotte Slivka.         As the editor in chief and a writer for the magazine Craft Horizons from 1959 to 1979, Ms. Slivka helped define the philosophy of crafts and the terms in which they were discussed at a time when the field was experiencing fast-growing popularity and professionalism. She favored a shift away from emphasis on traditional skills and techniques and toward more innovative forms of creative expression.         For example, she championed the sculpture of Peter Voulkos, whose monumental and aggressively energetic work in clay has been compared to Abstract Expressionist painting. She wrote a book about the artist, ''Peter Voulkos: A Dialogue With Clay'' .         Rose Charlotte Schiffer was born in New York City on Jan. 9, 1919. She received a degree in English from Hunter College in 1941, after which she worked as a writer and editor for a number of magazines and newspapers before starting with Craft Horizons. In 1980, after Craft Horizons stopped publication, Ms. Slivka started a quarterly called Craft International, but it lasted only a few issues.         In 1979 Ms. Slivka was named an honorary fellow of the American Craft Council. She later received honorary degrees from the Rhode Island School of Design and the Massachusetts College of Art.         In the mid-1980's Ms. Slivka moved to Springs, on Long Island, permanently and became the art critic for The East Hampton Star. She continued to write reviews and articles for The Star until illness forced her to stop last year.         Ms. Slivka's marriage to the sculptor David Slivka ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, of New York and East Hampton, and a grandchild.       
         Virginia Hamilton Adair, a California poet who published her first collection, ''Ants on the Melon,'' when she was 83, died on Thursday in Claremont, Calif., her daughter, Katharine Adair Waugh, said. She was 91 and lived in Claremont.         Published by Random House in 1996, ''Ants on the Melon'' received wide attention, partly because of Ms. Adair's personal story (a retired English professor, by then blind from glaucoma, she had written poetry all her life but had published little since the 1940's) and partly for the unaffected style and universal themes of her work.         The collection sold more than 28,000 copies, which her editor, Daniel Menaker, yesterday called an ''alpine'' figure for a volume of poetry.         Reviewing ''Ants on the Melon'' in The New York Times Book Review, Brad Leithauser wrote, ''Given how much darkness the book contains -- meditations on the atom bomb, her husband's death, a drowned girl, the literal dark of blindness -- it casts a surprisingly bright afterglow.''         In the poem ''Break-In,'' Ms. Adair wrote:         Hearing the footsteps of thieves         in the dark downstairs:         what are you looking for?         it has already been stolen         over and over. . . .         Mary Virginia Hamilton was born in the Bronx on Feb. 28, 1913, and was raised in Montclair, N.J. She disliked the name Mary and dropped it as soon as she left home. She grew up surrounded by poetry. Her father, Robert Browning Hamilton, was a serious amateur poet, and one of her earliest memories was of him reading Alexander Pope's ''Iliad'' to her in her crib. She began writing her own poems when she was 6.         Ms. Adair held a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke College and a master's from Radcliffe and was a professor at California Polytechnic University in Pomona for many years. In 1936, she married Douglass Adair, who became a prominent historian. Mr. Adair committed suicide in 1968.         In the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Adair published poems in The Saturday Review, The Atlantic and The New Republic. Though she continued to write almost daily, the demands of motherhood, and later of an academic career, plus her distaste for the gamesmanship of the publishing world, caused her to send out little work for the next half-century.         In the late 1980's, a friend, the poet Robert Mezey, encouraged Ms. Adair to put together a manuscript of her best work. Some years later, without her knowledge, he sent a copy to Alice Quinn, the New Yorker's poetry editor. Ms. Quinn published several of the poems, along with a rapturous essay on Ms. Adair, in the magazine's 1995 year-end double issue. After that, Ms. Adair's work appeared regularly in The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books. Though some critics were cautious (Jonathan Galassi called her ''a serious poet without being an earth-shatteringly original one''), others praised it lavishly. The poet Galway Kinnell told The New Yorker, ''She has arrived in our world like a comet.''         In addition to her daughter, of New Paltz, N.Y., Ms. Adair is survived by two sons, Robert, of Pomona, and Douglass, of Thermal, Calif.; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Sharifa Alkhateeb, an advocate for Muslim culture in the United States who helped place courses in Middle Eastern cultures and Arabic in public schools, died on Oct. 21 at her home in Ashburn, Va. She was 58.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter Nasreen.         Ms. Alkhateeb, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, spent much of her life interpreting Islam. Even as she adhered to Muslim traditions like covering her hair, she encouraged Muslim women to be active in their larger communities.         ''She was dedicated to understanding Islam for herself as opposed to Islam coming to us with all the cultural wrappings,'' said her sister Nafeesa Ahmad.         In 1992, she founded the North American Council for Muslim Women, an education and advocacy group, and was president of the Muslim Education Council, which instructed public-school teachers on Middle Eastern cultures, Islam and Muslim society.         In 2000, she created the Peaceful Families Project, which studies and raises awareness of domestic violence in Muslim communities and is financed by the Department of Justice. At the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, she was chairwoman of the Muslim caucus.         Ms. Alkhateeb wrote and lectured extensively to challenge stereotypes of Muslims, and particularly of Muslim women. She was a co-author of ''The Arab World Notebook,'' a secondary school textbook; for eight years she waged a campaign, which was successful, to make Arabic part of the language offerings in several high schools in Northern Virginia. Publishers of social studies textbooks would seek her comments, and she was an adviser to North American Muslim student groups.         Sharifa Ahmad was born on June 6, 1946, to a Yemeni father and a Czech mother. She finished high school in three years and attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which she received a bachelor's degree in English literature. She later received a master's degree in comparative religion from Norwich University, in Northfield, Vt. From 1978 to 1987 she and her husband lived in Saudi Arabia.         In the 1970's, Ms. Alkhateeb wrote for The Saudi Gazette, an English-language newspaper in Jidda, and she edited an English translation of the Koran. She was managing editor of The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences in the early 1990's.         In 1993, she created a monthly cable television program, ''Middle Eastern Parenting,'' for the Fairfax County (Va.) Public Schools.         After the Sept. 11 attacks, she became a team leader of the Community Resilience Project, a counseling center in Northern Virginia supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.         In addition to her daughter Nasreen Alkhateeb, of Brooklyn, and her sister Nafeesa Ahmad, of Oakland, Calif., Ms. Alkhateeb is survived by her husband, Mejdi; a brother, Muhammad Ahmad, of Horsham, Pa; her sisters Shahara Ahmad-Llewellyn of Manhattan and Sayyida Ahmad Jordan of Los Angeles; her daughters Layla Alkhateeb of Arlington, Va., and Maha Buthayna Alkhateeb of Potomac Falls, Va.; and a grandson.       
         Dr. M. Irené Ferrer, a New York cardiologist and medical educator who helped refine the cardiac catheter and electrocardiogram, which have become diagnostic essentials in heart treatment, died at her apartment in Manhattan last Friday. She was 89.         The cause was pneumonia combined with congestive heart failure, said a close friend, Dr. Marianne J. Legato, a Columbia cardiologist and internist, who was a protégée of Dr. Ferrer as a medical student in the 1950's.         Dr. Ferrer, who spent four decades at Columbia University, grew up as a New York society debutante, blossoming into an internationally recognized researcher and clinician.         Working at Bellevue Hospital in New York in the 1940's, she contributed to laboratory research that led to the cardiac catheter, a flexible tube passed through a patient's veins and directly into the heart or coronary arteries.         The catheter permits precise measurement of blood pressure and flow and has led to angioplasty and other revolutionary heart treatments. In 1956 its development was recognized with the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, shared by a German scientist, Dr. Werner Forssmann and two researchers from Columbia, André F. Cournand and Dr. Dickinson W. Richards. Dr. Richards noted Dr. Ferrer's studies in his Nobel lecture.         In later work Dr. Ferrer turned to the electrocardiogram, commonly known as an EKG, the electrical record of the heart's beating. She helped devise a computer-assisted algorithm that allowed a clearer and more immediate reading of that record. Previously, the test, which is often used to assess damages after a heart attack, could be interpreted only by doctors with specific training.         Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, chairman of the department of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said that Dr. Ferrer was ''a leader in electrocardiography at a time when it was the only test we had to judge the heart.'' He added, ''She taught today's teachers.''         Marie Irené Ferrer was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan and Bryn Mawr College before earning her medical degree at Columbia in 1941.         She practiced briefly at New York University, then returned to Columbia in 1946 and was named an assistant professor there five years later. Dr. Ferrer was appointed professor of clinical medicine in 1972 and became a professor emeritus in 1981. She continued in private practice until nine years ago.         Dr. Ferrer was a former editor in chief of Current Cardiology and The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. In 1993 she received a gold medal from Columbia Medical School's alumni association.         Dr. Ferrer is survived by a brother, Mel Ferrer, the actor and director, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
         Nancy Larrick, an educator whose poetry anthologies and widely used parent's guide helped introduce generations of children not only to reading, but also to literature, died on Nov. 14 in Winchester, Va. She was 93 and lived in Winchester.         The cause was pneumonia, said her stepson, Alexander C. Crosby.         Dr. Larrick considered the standard reading workbooks of the 1950's, with their picture games and stories about Dick and Jane, insulting to even a 5-year-old's intelligence. An editor of children's books for Random House, she preferred Dr. Seuss and Little Bear and asserted in a book review in The New York Times that children ''can hear the rhythm of beautifully turned phrases and follow the suspense of a good story line.''         In the poetry anthologies she edited, she included verses by the likes of Emily Dickinson, William Carlos Williams and Yuan Mei.         In a 1965 Saturday Review of Literature article, ''The All-White World of Children's Books,'' she criticized the near absence of black characters in children's books. Her criticism pushed publishers to evaluate their policies and led to several follow-up studies.         Dr. Larrick was a founder and president of the International Reading Association, a literacy group that today has 80,000 members in about 100 countries, and would invite teenagers and children to its annual conferences to give teachers pointers on what they enjoyed reading, though she never indulged their taste for comic books.         Her most popular work, ''A Parent's Guide to Children's Reading,'' was published in 1958 and reprinted six times.         Sequels included ''Your Child and His Reading: How Parents Can Help'' (1960), ''A Teacher's Guide to Children's Books'' (1963) and nine other books for adults. She wrote or edited almost 30 books for children, including at least 14 poetry anthologies.         Nancy Larrick Crosby, who used her maiden name professionally, was born Dec. 28, 1910, in Winchester. She graduated from Goucher College when she was 19 and became an English teacher like her mother, also named Nancy Larrick. She received a master's degree in education from Columbia in 1936 and a doctorate in education from New York University in 1955.         She was an adjunct professor at Lehigh University from 1964 to 1979 and later taught at N.Y.U. and Indiana University. She wrote dozens of articles for education journals.         Her husband, Alexander L. Crosby, died in 1980. In addition to her stepson, Alexander from Carmel, Calif; she is survived by three granddaughters and four great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Maude Lloyd, a dramatically expressive ballerina who became an articulate dance critic, writing in collaboration with her husband, Nigel Gosling, died on Nov. 26 at her home in London. She was 96.         She died after a brief hospitalization, said John Percival, a British freelance dance critic.Born in South Africa in 1908, Ms. Lloyd arrived in London as a dance student and in 1927 became associated with Ballet Rambert, a pioneering British ballet company. After capturing the attention of Antony Tudor, then a young choreographer eager to explore the possibilities of dramatic ballets, she danced in major works of his like ''The Planets'' (1934) and ''Dark Elegies'' (1937).         Perhaps her greatest characterization was that of Caroline in ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (1936), Tudor's poignant and often revived ballet about a young woman who must marry a man she does not love. Ms. Lloyd's eloquence contributed much to the impact of its premiere.         When she started teaching ballet classes for adult beginners, one of her students was a dance-loving young art critic, Mr. Gosling. She married him in 1939 and retired from the stage the next year.         Because Ms. Lloyd's conversation was as expressive as her dancing, and because she and her husband were inseparable, Richard Buckle, editor of Ballet magazine in London, suggested in 1951 that the couple write dance criticism as a team. They adopted Alexander Bland as a byline, derived from the names of two piglets (Pigling Bland and his brother Alexander) in a Beatrix Potter story.         After they wrote for various publications, the team as Alexander Bland began writing dance reviews in 1955 in The Observer, a weekly for which Gosling was also the art critic. Although Gosling stopped writing art criticism in 1975, reviews by Alexander Bland continued until Gosling died in 1982. Some of them are anthologized in ''Observer of the Dance'' (Dance Books, 1985).         When Rudolf Nureyev arrived in England after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1961, the Goslings hospitably took the young dancer under their wings and helped him adjust to his new country. They celebrated his achievements in their book ''The Nureyev Image'' (1976).         Ms. Lloyd is survived by a son, Nicholas, and grandchildren.       
         Mona Van Duyn, a poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner who spoke with a distinctly female voice from suburbia, died on Thursday at her home in suburban St. Louis. She was 83.         Her death was announced by Alfred A. Knopf, which published her ''Selected Poems'' two years ago. Her first book in nine years, it includes nearly half of the poems published in her previous eight volumes, starting with ''Valentines to the Wide World'' in 1959.         Knopf said Ms. Van Duyn (pronounced dine) had recently been found to have bone cancer.         To readers unfamiliar with her work, ''Selected Poems'' presented a generous and judicious sampling of a long and successful career, Brian Henry wrote in The New York Times Book Review.         ''Characterized by candor and compassion,'' he said, ''Van Duyn's poetry depicts the pleasures and drudgeries of middle-class American life, an approach that at its best becomes an exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of that life.         ''A pioneer of the poetry of the suburbs -- now a common mode in which the ordinary is routinely revealed as extraordinary -- Van Duyn also knows that the ordinary is frequently just that.''         Mr. Henry, editor of the magazine Verse and director of the creative writing program at the University of Georgia, mentioned the rare incendiary moments in her work but added that, ''Her poetry is primarily, and literally, civil, seeking to uphold the accepted foundations of civilization -- marriage and friendship, love and sympathy -- while occasionally plumbing those foundations for cracks.''         Mr. Henry wrote that he considered Ms. Van Duyn's first three books to be her best, especially ''To See, To Take,'' her second, which won the National Book Award for Poetry in 1971. In it she interwove religious and mythological themes, like divine and human love and the violence of love, with less exalted topics.         In one poem, for example, she compared her work to home canning, writing:         Oh, I know, I know that, great or humble, the arts         in their helplessness can save but a few selves         by such disguises from Time's hideous bite,         and yet, a sweating Proust of the pantry shelves,         I cupboard these pickled peaches in Time's despite.         Ms. Van Duyn was selected by the Library of Congress in 1992 to serve a term as the United States poet laureate. She was the sixth laureate and the first woman to be chosen.         When notified by James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress at the time, Ms. Van Duyn said it was clear to her that the selectors who made the choice were ''getting very nervous'' about the absence of a woman as laureate.         Before the position was formally established by Congress in 1985, it had a forerunner in the library's poetry consultant. There were about two dozen of them, but only a handful were women.         A year before becoming poet laureate, Ms. Van Duyn won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The award cited her for ''Near Changes'' (Knopf, 1990). She also received, among many others, the Bollingen Prize in 1970; the Carl Sandburg Prize of Cornell College in 1982; the Hart Crane Memorial Award in 1968; the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 1989; the Shelley Memorial Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1987; and a Guggenheim fellowship in 1972. She was also a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Mona Jane Van Duyn was born on May 9, 1921, in Waterloo, Iowa, and graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 1942, when it was the Iowa State Teachers College. She received a master's degree from the University of Iowa the next near and taught English there until 1946. In 1943 she married Jarvis A. Thurston, whom she met in a writing class and who became a professor of English; he survives her.         She also had an academic career, teaching at the University of Louisville, in Kentucky, and at Washington University in St. Louis, as well as at writing seminars and conferences.         Between ''Valentines'' and ''Selected Poems,'' she also published, among others, ''A Time of Bees'' (1964); ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (1982); ''If It Be Not I: Collected Poems 1959-1982'' (1992), which included much of her earlier work; and ''Firefall'' (1992), which remains in print at Knopf.         ''I don't know why that is,'' she said 14 years ago as the newly chosen laureate, musing about why women were not anthologized or consulted as frequently as men. ''Perhaps it is because younger women are able to teach, or take the time to raise children. Even for older women, one's life is complicated. It is difficult to be called by a reporter or the Library of Congress when one is cooking a complicated recipe.''         Or, as she once put it in another context:         The world is perverse,         but it could be worse.         (''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems.'')         Correction:  December 23, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the poet Mona Van Duyn on Dec. 4 misstated the first line of a couplet from her poem ''Sonnet for Minimalists'' and misidentified the first book in which it appeared. The couplet reads, ''The world's perverse/but it could be worse' -- not ''The world is perverse.'' The sonnet was first published in book form in ''Near Changes'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1990), not in ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (Atheneum, 1982).
