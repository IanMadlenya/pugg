         Clare Potter, a leading American fashion designer of the 1930's and 40's known for imaginative use of color and simplicity of line, died Jan. 5 at her home in Fort Ann, N.Y. She was 95.         Along with Claire McCardell and Tina Leser, Ms. Potter was one of the designers credited with inventing American sportswear, a style that has influenced designers all over the world. She was a featured designer at Lord & Taylor when the store was headed by the legendary Dorothy Shaver, and received the first Lord & Taylor Design Award in 1938 for ''distinguished designing in the field of sports clothes for women.'' She also received a Neiman Marcus Award in 1939 and a Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1946. In 1939, she designed a blue wool dress for Eleanor Roosevelt to wear to meet King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England.         Several of Ms. Potter's designs are  in an exhibition called, ''Designing Women: American Style 1940-1960,'' at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.         ''She was incredibly important,'' said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''She was one of that first group in the 1930's of designers recognized by name. She was recognized by American women for getting rid of ornamentation. She wasn't the boldest, like Claire McCardell, but she was known for color and simple textures, for a discreet style of dressing, for sophisticated sportswear.''         An aristocratic-looking woman who loved sports, particularly horseback riding, Ms. Potter designed for women like herself who favored casual clothes that were simple yet sophisticated. ''Large numbers of American women want clothes that are refined,'' Ms. Potter said in a 1948 interview with The New York Times. ''I aim to give them in a medium-priced, ready-to-wear costume what they would find in custom-made styles.''         Among the styles she was known for were the two-piece swimsuit consisting of a bra and bloomers, the evening sweater and the sidesaddle-draped skirt. Even for evening, her designs tended to be as casual as a shirt and skirt or pants and a tunic. One outfit of the 1940's combined a rose-colored blouse, a pale blue floor-length skirt and a green belt.         ''She did forward-looking active sports clothes, sundresses, trousers, bathing suits and evening sweaters,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''She wasn't influenced by Paris, but by the modern American leisure life style.''         Ms. Potter was born in Jersey City in 1903. Her affinity for color could be traced to an interest in art she developed while in high school, where she was art editor of the school paper, and continued with studies at the Art Students League. Although she did not know how to sew, she took a draping course and produced what she later described as ''my first weird costume,'' consisting of a long, slinky red wool dress with huge silk sleeves that she dyed to match.         She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and after graduation found a job with a dress manufacturer. In 1948 she went into partnership with Martha Stout, a former magazine editor, in a ready-to-wear company called Timbertop. The name came from the turkey farm in West Nyack, N.Y., where Ms. Potter lived with her husband, J. Sanford Potter, an architect.         By the mid-1950's she was in business on her own, working from a barn on her farm with her husband drafting the patterns for her clothing. ''It was very chic to go out there and buy things in a lovely spot,'' recalled Virginia Wagoner Booth, who was then a buyer for Lord & Taylor and became a lifelong friend.         In the late 1950's, Mr. Potter designed and built a Japanese-style house in Fort Ann on Lake Nebo, where the couple grew camellias and raised Dalmatians.         ''They kept horses down in Virginia,'' Ms. Booth said, ''and went down every weekend in the fall to hunt. Clare remained physically active almost until the end. When she took to her bedroom, she could look out at the lake and see the birds. She loved to watch and feed the birds.         ''When Sandy died four years ago,'' she added, referring to Mr. Potter, ''we scattered his ashes on the property. We'll do the same thing with hers.''         Ms. Potter left no survivors.       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         DEBBIE BOYLAN is a dinosaur and proud of it, the owner of an independent bookstore in Westchester County who is not persuaded that she wants to go head-to-head with Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com.         Her customers at Good Yarns in Hastings-on-Hudson are more than happy to bring their own coffee, a plain cuppa joe for 60 cents from the bagel place next door, rather than take out a loan for a double latte at the nearest superstore.         And they'd prefer to drop in for an hour of good conversation rather than order a book with the click of a mouse. Internet shopping may be  efficient, but it's not a way of finding out whose daffodils have popped and whose children have gotten into college.         Good Yarns, by all accounts, is a dying breed, a hole-in-the-wall in an era of megamalls, a brick-and-mortar business in the age of on-line commerce. It is one of 3,300 independent book stores, according to the American Booksellers Association, down from 5,200 in 1992.         In response to the threat of extinction, the trade group has hired a marketing heavyweight, begun a national advertising campaign to encourage people to shop small and created its own on-line store, scheduled to open this summer.         Ms. Boylan and her co-owner, Rowie Edelman, plan to read the prospectus on the joint venture, which Michael F. Hoynes, the association's new marketing director, says is ''like True Value Hardware,'' a way for the little guys to ''come together but keep their identity.'' But the owners of Good Yarns are skeptical.         ''I don't see us expanding on the Internet,'' Ms. Boylan said. ''We have a finite and loyal customer base. They want to touch books, look at books, talk about books.''         Good Yarns was abuzz with gardening chatter earlier this week, when 60 degree temperatures had snow dripping from eaves all over town, the current rushing in the Saw Mill River and doors open along Main Street. A landscape architect from Irvington came in for Faulkner's ''As I Lay Dying.'' She stayed to commiserate with Ginny Auld, a saleswoman, who was mourning a dead butterfly weed, whose orange blooms had brightened her yard for 19 years.         A former Hastings resident who now lives across the river in Nyack stopped in after her weekly Jewish history class at the temple. She left with ''A Boy's Life,'' by Tobias Wolfe and ''The Story of Little Babaji,'' a version of ''Little Black Sambo'' that restores much of the original 1899 text. But not before a lengthy discourse on roses.         THE hot book on this balmy day was a well-reviewed first novel, ''Amy and Isabelle,'' by Elizabeth Strout. Ms. Boylan had ordered two copies for regular customers from the nearby river towns who were willing to wait a few days rather than shop in one of several Barnes & Nobles on Central Avenue, the dreary commercial spine of the county. Both costumers rushed in as soon as they got the telephone call. ''I have it on order, too,'' Ms. Boylan said. Disappointment crossed her face. She could not ''borrow'' a copy for the early morning hours when she does most of her reading.         Ms. Boylan grew up just blocks from the store, graduated from Hastings High School and Mercy College in neighboring Dobbs Ferry. She went to school with half the merchants in the village, and her 53-year-old sister, Donna, with the other half. The women own a two-family house and share responsibility for their elderly father, who is blind. Reading time is scarce with the demands of an aging parent and a seven-day-a-week business. Ms. Boylan pines for the expansive days of childhood, when she would read ''Black Beauty'' over and over. At 12, she discovered ''Franny and Zooey,'' was ''knocked of my feet'' and ''never read another kids' book again.''         Now, binge reading is possible only  on vacation. During a recent week in Florida, she raced through three novels and found herself bookless at the airport. It was one of the few times in her life, Ms. Boylan said, that she has bought a book someplace other than at Good Yarns.         The store was once a needlepoint shop. But times changed, wives and mothers went to work, and the wool and crochet hooks gave way to novels and biographies. Ms. Boylan was a customer back then, buying books -- mainly 20th century American fiction -- to read on the train to Manhattan, where she worked as an editor. Later, with her sister, she owned a graphic design business. With the advent of desktop publishing, her business became obsolete and Ms. Boylan took part-time work at Good Yarns while she looked for something to do. That turned out to be buying a share of the store when Ms. Edelman's partner retired.         The two women seem quaintly oblivious to issues like foot traffic. ''I'm trying to envision a busy day, '' Ms. Boylan said. ''Fifty customers? A hundred? I'm guessing. But a good day is anything over $1,000.''         And what sells well in a village of 8,000 that supports four bookstores (one second-hand, one for foreign language books and one for first editions)? Hardcover nonfiction. Paperback fiction. Local authors. Whatever Ms. Boylan recommends -- lately Alice McDermott's ''Charming Billy'' or Don DeLillo's ''Underworld.''         ''Low-end political scandal and movie star books don't go here,'' she said. ''We've only sold two Monicas. If we sold three I'd be surprised.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Felicia Gizycka Magruder, an American heiress who was kidnapped as a child by her father, a continental count, died on Feb. 26 at the Regency retirement community in Laramie, Wyo. She was 93 and moved to Laramie from New Canaan, Conn., in 1995.         Mrs. Magruder was the former Countess Felicia Gizycka, the only daughter of the Chicago-born newspaper heiress Eleanor Medill Patterson and Count Josef Gizycki, a fortune-hunting scion of a noble Polish family. Ms. Patterson, who eventually divorced the count, was a granddaughter of Joseph Medill, the founder of The Chicago Tribune.         The little Countess Felicia, as the newspapers later called her, was born in 1905 in Blansko in what is now the Czech Republic.         In 1908, when Felicia was a golden-haired, blue-eyed toddler, The New York Times reported that she had been ''kidnapped in London by the Count,'' who ''is thought to be either in Vienna or St. Petersburg and has concealed the child.'' The Times said that earlier ''the Countess ran away from him with her child one night after a violent quarrel.''         The ensuing custody struggle led President-elect William Howard Taft to intervene with Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in whose realm the Gizycki family estates were located. In December 1908, Taft wrote the Czar pointing out Felicia's mother's connection to Russia and saying that the count had put the kidnapped toddler in a convent in Russia. Taft asked the Czar to ''make such order to Count Gizycki as shall seem to Your Majesty equitable.''         The Czar commanded the count to return Felicia to her mother, and when that happened, as one Patterson biographer has written, ''they caught the first train for Germany and from there took the first steamship to America.''         Lake Forest, Ill. became their home. Mrs. Magruder's mother also bought a ranch in Wyoming, and there, as The Laramie Daily Boomerang reported in its obituary of Mrs. Magruder, an able young journalist named Drew Pearson ''came out to court Felicia.''         But things did not go smoothly, and the teen-age countess ''caught a train to San Diego, where she took an assumed name and supported herself as a waitress.'' In a 1939 interview she said, ''I tell you, I was good'' as a waitress.         ''I could swing a mean tray,'' she added. ''I always wanted to make my own way in life -- it gives one a nice feeling.''         Undeterred, Pearson caught up with her. He is said to have made her a practical offer: ''Look, you're only 18. Marry me now and in three years, if you don't love me, you can leave and start your life all over again.'' Their marriage began in 1925, produced a daughter, Ellen, and was ended in divorce by Mrs. Pearson after three years.         But what years they were, with the promising Pearson, who was not yet the mighty syndicated columnist he later became, taking his young wife  to China and beyond, while he polished his journalistic skills.         In later years she wrote for American magazines and newspapers, lived in New York and elsewhere, and wrote novels and short stories.  In her 1939 novel ''Flower of Smoke,'' the Austrian-American heroine says, ''Make your own peace, no matter what.''         After living for years in New Canaan she moved for good to Wyoming, where she had relatives.         Her 1934 marriage to an Englishman, Dudley de Lavigne, ended in divorce. Her 1958 marriage to John Kennedy Magruder, a landscape architect and a director of the Alcoholics Anonymous Men's Home in Alexandria, Va., also ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Pearson Arnold of San Diego; three grandsons, Joe and Drew Arnold of Laramie and George Arnold of Evanston, Wyo.; a granddaughter, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Lutyens, a well-born English  biographer and novelist who was applauded by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, died on April 9 in London. She was 90 and lived in London and the English county of Dorset.         Miss Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) was a daughter of Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869-1944), the British architect who planned New Delhi and many of its Government buildings, including the Viceroy's palace. Her mother was Lady Emily Lutyens, daughter of the First Earl of Lytton, a poet and a Viceroy of India.         Not surprisingly, Mary Lutyens was worldly as well as literary. In London, The Independent noted,  ''She was famous for her dry martinis and her elegance and, although unmusical, danced alone to Cole Porter for exercise.'' As a writer, she won praise for the accuracy and readability of her biographies, which included ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (1968). Sir John Everett Millais (1829-96) was a handsome British painter and a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in Britain. John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a British social theorist and critic whose wife, Effie, fell in love with Millais.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn G. Heilbrun noted: ''Mary Lutyens has now restored to England the Davis Cup for the editing of Victorian letters -- a trophy long in American hands. In 'Millais and the Ruskins,' combining exemplary scholarship with editing that is at once tactful and informative, she uses many previously unpublished letters by eminent Victorians to tell a passionate and moving story. Her book will be equally valuable to the Victorian scholar and to what used to be called the general reader.''         Miss Lutyens was the editor of a related book-length collection of letters, ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice,'' which was described in The Times Book Review by another critic, Joan Evans, as ''admirably and discreetly edited.''         Miss Lutyens also wrote several authoritative books about the Indian spiritual philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurt (1895-1986). They include ''Krishnamurti: The Open Door'' (1991).         Her more than a dozen works of fiction include ''Cleo'' (1974), which Martin Levin in The Times Book Review called a ''flawless tour de force.''         She also wrote fiction under the pseudonym Esther Wyndham.         Miss Lutyens was born in London and educated privately before attending Queens College, London. She  became a writer in her early 20's.         She married Anthony Sewell in 1930 and the couple were divorced in 1945. Later that year she married J. G. Links, an art expert known as Joe, who died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Amanda.       
         Sara Holmes Boutelle, an architectural historian who rediscovered Julia Morgan, one of the first female architects to achieve major success, died on Wednesday at the Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 90.         Until Ms. Boutelle published ''Julia Morgan, Architect'' (1988), little was known about Morgan (1872-1957) beyond the fact that she had designed William Randolph Hearst's spectacular California castle, San Simeon.         Ms. Boutelle's biography, which traced Morgan's career from the turn of the century to the late 1950's, revealed that she designed nearly 800 buildings, a legacy rivaling that of Frank Lloyd Wright, her contemporary. Her accomplishment was remarkable also at a time when women were rarely able to enter the profession.         Helen Searing, a professor of art at Smith College who knew Ms. Boutelle, said her revelations about Julia Morgan were ''indispensable because before that she was virtually unknown to all but a handful of architectural historians.''         ''Sara Boutelle was not a feminist by today's standards and not strident at all,'' said Professor Searing, ''but she put the spotlight on women in architecture, especially on Julia Morgan.''         Ms. Boutelle, who taught art and architecture at the Brearley School in New York, became fascinated with Morgan when she visited San Simeon in 1972 and learned that its architect was a woman she had never heard of. When Ms. Boutelle retired from Brearley the next year, she moved to Northern California and began to study the building.         Ms. Boutelle discovered that Morgan had worked alone and destroyed most of her blueprints shortly before her death. She began reconstructing Morgan's designs from the scattered records of former clients. In 1988 Ms. Boutelle finally published her 271-page biography, an oversize book with photographs and drawings.         Among the buildings designed by Morgan that Ms. Boutelle was able to document were the Hearst estate, Wyntoon, in Northern California; the Asilomar Y.W.C.A. conference center in Monterey, Calif., and, in Berkeley, Calif., the Women's City Club, St. John's Presbyterian Church and the Hearst Memorial Gymnasium.         Ms. Boutelle found that Morgan also designed schools, theaters, churches, stores, hospitals, houses, apartments, a bowling alley, billard rooms, a zoo, a pet cemetery and a hay barn. She said Morgan had ''a special knack'' for swimming pools, using color, light and shape to create ''sumptuous designs that flaunted a hedonism startling for so modest an architect.''         Reviews were favorable. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Paul Goldberger said the book covered Morgan's career ''with sympathy and intelligence.'' Diana Ketcham, writing for The Nation, called it ''an exemplary work.''         Publication of the Morgan biography, which won the California Book Award Silver Medal in 1989, led Ms. Boutelle to embark on a new career as a lecturer and preservationist of historic architecture. For these activities, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects in 1991, the highest award the organization gives to someone who is not an architect.         Ms. Boutelle was educated at Mount Holyoke College, the Sorbonne and Hamburg University.         Ms. Boutelle is survived by three sons, Christopher, of Los Angeles, William, of West Chesterfield, Mass., and Jonathan of Santa Cruz; a sister, Mary Holmes of Santa Cruz, and six grandchildren.       
         Patricia Beer, a British poet concerned with death, theology and the mysteries of everyday existence,  died on Aug. 15. She was 79.         The cause and place of her death were unavailable.         Ms. Beer was among the few candidates for successor to Ted Hughes,  Britain's poet laureate, who died in October.         Her poems have been described by  critics and scholars as sly, dry, ironic and economical with well-observed landscapes. Occasionally they were also called prosaic, gloomy, flat and almost housewifely.         Andrew Motion, Britain's new poet laureate, reviewing her ''Selected Poems'' in The New Statesman in 1980, said Ms. Beer ''admits to having been 'a child who dared not seem/Gloomy,' but over the years she has become increasingly prepared to say what she feels. The fear of death and the lack of absolute religious security have proved more than a match for her instinct to explain and placate.''         Ms. Beer's themes often included theology, mortality and daily existence. In ''Middle Age'' she wrote:         Everywhere I look it is the same,         The churchyard or the other side of the bed.         The one who is not lying there         Could have been.         And in the poem ''Home,'' she wrote:         Out of the window         I see the opposite roofs         Fitting well like ours.         This house is as warm         And secure as bath water.         Yet very often         Through the double glazing         I imagine people crying,         Somewhere out there.         In ''Reader, I Married Him'' (1975), a study of the female characters of Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell and George Eliot, Ms. Beer ''demonstrates with wit, wide knowledge and a bare minimum of footnotes that even the greatest of women novelists were enthralled by the need of preserving the superior position of men,'' wrote Carolyn G. Heilbrun in The New York Times Book Review.         Her first volume of poetry, ''The Loss of the Magyar,'' was published in 1959. Among her other books of poetry were ''The Survivors'' (1963), ''The Resurrection'' (1967), ''The Estuary'' (1971), ''Driving West''  (1975), ''Poems'' (1979), ''The Lie of the Land'' (1983), ''Collected Poems'' (1989), ''Friend of Heraclitus''  (1993) and ''Autumn'' (1997).         She also wrote a novel, ''Moon's Ottery'' (1978), and a childhood memoir, ''Mrs. Beer's House'' (1968), about her upbringing in a family of Christian fundamentalists.         Patricia Beer was born on Nov. 4, 1919, in Exmouth, Devon. She was brought up by members of the strict Plymouth Brethren sect; her first poems were hymns. She went to Exeter University and received a degree in literature from Oxford University. She taught English at the University of Padua in Italy from 1947 to 1949, and at the British Institute in Rome from 1949 to 1951.         She returned to England in 1953 and taught at the University of London. She also reviewed books for The Daily Telegraph in the 1980's and  contributed to The London Review of Books.         Her first marriage ended in divorce. In 1964, she married John Damien Parsons, an architect, who survives her.       
         M. C. Richards, a poet, potter, essayist, translator and painter, who taught at Black Mountain College in the late 1940's and thereafter became an impassioned advocate of community in both art and life, died on Friday at Camphill Village, an agricultural community in Kimberton, Pa., where she had lived since 1984. She was 83.         An artist who wrote poems about pottery and made pots inspired by her reading, Ms. Richards was perhaps best known for ''Centering in Pottery, Poetry and the Person,'' a book of essays published in the middle of the tumultuous 1960's that was impressive for its synthesis of thought, plain speech and incantatory momentum. The book, which became an underground classic, pulled together ideas about perception, craft, education, creativity, religion and spirituality, arguing for the richness of daily experience if carefully attended to, and the creativity of the average person. ''Poets are not the only poets,'' Ms. Richards wrote.         Mary Caroline Richards was born in Weiser, Idaho, in 1916 and reared in Portland, Ore. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature and languages from Reed College in 1937, with a thesis titled ''Poetry of the Tang Dynasty in Relation to Western Imagism.'' She went on to the University of California at Berkeley, where she studied Chinese and wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on irony in Thomas Hardy in 1942. She then began a brief marriage, and taught English at the Central Washington College of Education in Ellensburg, Wash., and at the University of Chicago. But she found academic life stifling.         In 1945 she married Albert William Levi Jr., her second husband and a social scientist who was invited that year to join the faculty of the experimental Black Mountain College, near Asheville, N.C. Black Mountain was a short-lived laboratory for innovative teaching and art whose faculty and students included Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, David Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg and Charles Olson.         At Black Mountain Ms. Richards taught writing, produced and, when necessary, translated plays by Cocteau, Satie and Yeats. She also danced and studied pottery with Robert Turner. Around 1950 she participated in what might have been the first ''happening,'' with Cage, Olson, Mr. Rauschenberg and Franz Kline. In 1951 she separated from her husband, whom she later divorced, and in 1952 she went to New York with Tudor.         She studied pottery at Greenwich House in Greenwich Village, attended the meetings of the downtown avant-garde known as the Club and worked on the first English translation of Antonin Artaud's influential ''Theater and Its Double,'' published by Grove Press in 1958.         In 1954 Ms. Richards, Tudor and Cage, along with Paul Williams, an architect, and Karen Karnes, a potter, who had both also been at Black Mountain, established a commune called the Land near Stony Point, N.Y. Ms. Richards lived there for a decade, working in a studio with Ms. Karnes; they developed a form of flame-proof clay that enabled them to make ceramic cookware.         Ms. Richards began giving pottery workshops in the early 1960's. Reflecting the ideas that would figure in ''Centering,'' these became increasingly interdisciplinary, with titles like ''Clay and Words,'' ''Clay and Movement'' and ''Clay and Eurythmy.'' She lectured and taught workshops at schools in the United States, Canada and Britain. Her longest teaching affiliation, from 1986 until her death, was with the University of Creation Spirituality, established in Oakland, Calif., by Matthew Fox, a Dominican priest.         Ms. Richards's books, which often mixed prose and poetry, included ''The Crossing Point'' (1973), ''Opening Our Moral Eye'' (1996), ''Imagine Inventing Yellow'' (1991) and ''Toward Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America,'' a work of social philosophy. The Camphill community in Kimberton is one of 80 Camphills worldwide based on Steiner's teachings.         In 1989 Ms. Richards, who has no survivors, added painting to her roster of activities. She then exhibited ceramics, poems and paintings together, most recently at the Works Gallery in Philadelphia in 1997. The Worcester Center for Crafts in Massachusetts is organizing a retrospective of her work that is to open on  Oct. 9, with a public memorial.         Ms. Richards embraced old age with characteristic openness, writing  a poem in 1997 in which she saw herself as ''living toward dying, blooming into invisibility.''         Correction:  September 23, 1999, Thursday  An obituary of the poet and potter M. C. Richards on Monday misstated the date of her death. It was Sept. 10, not Sept. 17.       
         Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and painting in the 1960's and then left the New York art world for self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation Center in Texas.  She was 68 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's cousin.         Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum. They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body, intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of tools.         By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism, making nearly monochromatic ''Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960's she also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life. These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art world that bordered on hostility.         Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art, attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her ''Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and letting them fall where they may. In ''Transistor Radio Piece'' she listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.         In 1969 and 1970 Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the art world in works that she titled ''General Strike Piece'' and ''Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.         Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. A brief marriage in the late 1950's to an architect, Adrian Lozano, ended in divorce. She leaves no survivors.         Ms. Lozano had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries, Mitchell Algus, Rosen & Van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ''Wave'' paintings and notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these exhibitions were men.       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.         Through a productive career spanning eight decades, Ms. Perriand designed tubular ''equipment for living'' with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, bamboo furniture in Japan, lobbies for Air France in London and Tokyo, workers' housing in the Sahara and ski resort interiors in the French Alps.         Her ideas about flexible space, free-form shapes, natural materials and furniture designed to make ''space sing'' made her a modernist with a humanist agenda. The legs on her dining table were splayed, for example, so that people sitting at the ends could stretch their legs.         Preferring to be known as an interior architect instead of a furniture designer, Ms. Perriand subscribed to the modernist notion that furnishings and architecture needed to be developed as a single entity.         Her collaborations were often especially productive. The primary-colored bookcase with cupboards painted by Sonia Delaunay for the dormitory for Tunisian students at the Cite Universitaire in Paris and the lighting table (table and fluorescent overhead lights in one) she designed with Jean Prouve in 1953 are prized by collectors and sometimes reproduced without authorization.         ''For nearly three quarters of a century, Perriand has been one of the major innovators in French design, and her career embraces much of the history of 20th-century design in France,'' said Mary McLeod, an architectural historian at Columbia University.         Ms. Perriand was born in Paris on Oct. 24, 1903. Her early talent for drawing led her to the Ecole de l'Union Central des Arts Decoratifs. By 1926 she had been selected to exhibit her work at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs, from which the name of the Art Deco movement derives.         Her ''bar under the roof,'' an installation featuring a built-in chrome-walled bar counter and card table with pool-pocket drink holders, caused a sensation at the 1927 Salon d'Automne and established her as an avant-garde talent to watch.         Believing that she had nowhere to go but to the top, as she told Roger Aujame, a friend and former Corbusier Foundation director who is working on a catalog of her works, Ms. Perriand sought a job at Le Corbusier's studio. His initial withering response, ''We don't embroider cushions here,'' has become part of modernist lore. But once he went to see her bar installation, Le Corbusier hired her on the spot.         The years from 1927 to 1937 that she spent working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were formative and soon, like Corbusier, Ms. Perriand was making manifesto-style declarations about ''the new man'' and wearing her signature necklace of steel ball bearings. But it was her love of nature, especially the mountains where she often retreated, and her pragmatism that tempered the strict angularities of their furniture classics like the chaise longue and the famous cube-shaped Grand Confort chair.         In 1940 Ms. Perriand was invited to Japan, where she used traditional materials like bamboo, pine and woven straw to make modern shapes. When war broke out, she moved to Vietnam; unable to get a return visa to France, she worked for the colonial government. There she met Jacques Martin, a local official, whom she married in 1943. (An earlier, brief marriage in 1926 ended in divorce.) The couple had one daughter in 1944, Pernette Perriand, now an architect in Paris. Mr. Martin died in 1986.         Ms. Perriand returned to Paris in 1946 and was soon working on a wide range of projects, from ski resorts to student housing. Fiercely independent, she rejected frequent requests to furnish interiors designed by other architects. But she was eager to work with Mr. Prouve, the designer and manufacturer who collaborated with her and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also collaborated again with Le Corbusier on the Unite d'Habitation housing project in Marseilles.         Ms. Perriand continued to travel to Japan and Brazil for inspiration, but spent much of her time from 1967 to 1982 working on the Arcs, a vast compound of ski resorts in the Alps.         In the 1980's the retrospectives of her work began, first at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in 1985 and then at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Design Museum in London in 1996 and the Architectural League in Manhattan in 1997. But Ms. Perriand looked ahead, not back, and at the time of her death was exploring the possibilities of new materials for the 21st century.         At a league lecture, Ms. Perriand told the young design students there, ''We are leaving the age of oak and entering a period that will be defined by lightness, suppleness and the ephemeral.''
