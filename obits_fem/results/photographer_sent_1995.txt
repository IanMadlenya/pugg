She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.
Ms. Leen was married for many years to Serge Balkin, a fashion photographer.
It also serves as the signature image of an exhibition of the photographer's work that is currently at the International Center of Photography.
After being discovered at age 20 -- a clerical worker, she was shopping at a Fifth Avenue department store when spotted by an assistant to Louise Dahl-Wolfe, the celebrated Harper's Bazaar photographer -- Ms. Tripp soon began to appear frequently on magazine covers.
When she took over as the official photographer for the excavations in the Athenian agora, the civic center of the ancient city, she carried with her a Ph.D. in classics from Columbia University and an undergraduate degree in the same area from Smith College.
Five years later, she joined the archeological staff at the agora, and in 1939 was made its official photographer, a position she kept until 1964.
