        Elaine de Kooning, a painter, teacher and writer on art, died of lung cancer yesterday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in East Hampton.         Elaine de Kooning, a painter, teacher and writer on art, died of lung cancer yesterday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in East Hampton.         Mrs. de Kooning, who was married to the artist Willem de Kooning, was a highly versatile painter whose work ranged from realism to abstraction but was grounded in the gestural Abstract Expressionism of the New York School. Her landscapes, portraits and studies of athletes in action were notable for their verve and freshness.         ''I always say I'm an escape artist,'' she told the critic Rose Slivka when asked to characterize her style. ''Style is something I've always tried to avoid. I'm more interested in character. Character comes out of the work. Style is applied or imposed on it.'' Sketches for a Series         Seized by a particular theme, she would explore many aspects of it. She did 50 watercolor sketches, for instance, to begin a series devoted to Bacchus, a series inspired by her encounter with ''the churning, writhing movement'' of a statue in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris in 1976.         When she was commissioned in 1962 to do a portrait of President John F. Kennedy for the Truman Library in Independence, Mo., she characteristically immersed herself in the project, turning out hundreds of sketches and some two dozen finished canvases in her attempt to capture the President's restless energy.         One of the finished portraits hangs in the Truman Library; the other is in the John F. Kennedy Library at Cambridge, Mass. Cave Art Inspired Recent Work         Her recent work was inspired by the paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, which she felt were close in spirit to 20th-century art. In her show at the Fischbach Gallery in New York City last November, the grafitti-like images of horses, deer, antelope, bison and bulls appeared in flowing panorama, seeming to emerge - as they do in the caves themselves - by means of spontaneous brushwork from the rough, accidental surfaces of the cave walls. The ambitious series was the culmination of work begun in 1983 after a visit to Lascaux.         Elaine Marie Catherine Fried was born in New York City on March 12, 1920, the oldest child of Charles Frank and Mary Ellen O'Brien Fried. She was introduced to art at an early age by her mother, who covered the walls of their Brooklyn home with reproductions of famous paintings. After her graduation from Erasmus Hall High School, she put in a brief stint at Hunter College, then switched to the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in Manhattan, where she fell in with a congenial group of abstract and Social Realist painters. In 1938, at the age of 18, she met Mr. de Kooning in a Manhattan cafeteria. They were married in 1943. First Solo Show in 1952         Mrs. de Kooning's first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery in New York. An insightful writer and lecturer on art, she held teaching posts at many colleges and universities, including Yale, Carnegie-Mellon, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Georgia, Bard College, the Cooper Union and the Parsons School of Fine Art in New York.         Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and in a number of other institutions throughout the country.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Marjorie Luyckx, and two brothers, Conrad and Peter Fried, all of Freeport, L.I., and a stepdaughter, Lisa, of Springs, L.I.         A funeral service will be held at 1 P.M. on Saturday at the Williams Funeral Home, 99 Newtown Lane, in East Hampton.

Esther Hargrave Greenleaf, a painter, printmaker and ceramist, died yesterday. She was 84 years old and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.         Mrs. Greenleaf taught art history at Cooper Union and the University of Minnesota, her alma mater. She exhibited in the Dartmouth College Gallery and the Cambridge Art Association's Symphony Hall Show in Massachusetts.         She is survived by her husband, Robert K. Greenleaf; a son, Newcomb, of New York City; two daughters, Elizabeth, of New Haven, and Madeline Jaynes of New York City; a brother, William Hargrave of Lansdowne, Pa.; a sister, Nora Bailey of Short Hills, N.J., and seven grandchildren.       
        Marie Poland Fish, an oceanographer and marine biologist whose research in underwater sound detection helped the United States Navy to distinguish schools of fish from submarines, died yesterday at the Mediplex Nursing Home in Westport, Conn. She was 88 years old and had lived for many years in Kingston, R         Marie Poland Fish, an oceanographer and marine biologist whose research in underwater sound detection helped the United States Navy to distinguish schools of fish from submarines, died yesterday at the Mediplex Nursing Home in Westport, Conn. She was 88 years old and had lived for many years in Kingston, R.I.         In 1966 Dr. Fish was awarded the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award, its highest decoration for a civilian, for her two decades of work in bioacoustics under contract to the Office of Naval Rsearch. Most of her work was conducted at the University of Rhode Island's Naragansett Marine Laboratory in Kingston, which was founded by her husband, Dr. Charles Fish.         To enable antisubmarine vessels properly to identify enemy targets and avoid attacking whales or schools of smaller fish, she recorded and analyzed the sounds of more than 300 species of marine life, from mammals to mussels.         A native of Paterson, N.J., she was a graduate of Smith College and received a doctorate in science from the University of Rhode Island.         Dr. Fish, whose husband died in 1979, is survived by their daughter, Marilyn Munro of Westport; a sister, Margaret Tongue of East Orange, N.J.; three grandchldren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Marie Syrkin, an author, editor and teacher who was active in the Zionist cause for many decades, died of cancer Wednesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89 years old and lived in Santa Monica.         Marie Syrkin, an author, editor and teacher who was active in the Zionist cause for many decades, died of cancer Wednesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89 years old and lived in Santa Monica.         Miss Syrkin was born in Bern, Switzerland, the daughter of Dr. Nachman Syrkin, a prominent Socialist Zionist theoretician. She came with her family to the United States in 1908 and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Cornell University, then taught high school in New York City. Her first book, ''Your School, Your Children,'' published in 1944, was an impassioned plea for schools to propagandize democratic values instead of remaining neutral in the war of ideas.         In 1950 Miss Syrkin was named associate professor of English at Brandeis University, where she taught until her retirement in 1966 as professor of the humanities.         Her involvement with Zionism dated to the early 1930's, when she was a translator of Yiddish poetry and a commentator on Jewish life in the United States. She was a founder of the Labor Zionist journal Jewish Frontier in 1934 and for a quarter century beginning in 1948 was its editor in chief. Her most recent article for the magazine appears in its current issue. Golda Meir Biography         In the 1940's Miss Syrkin made the first of many trips to Palestine - later Israel - to interview survivors of the Holocaust and to gather material for her 1947 book, ''Blessed Is the Match: The Story of Jewish Resistance,'' which chronicled the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto and other revolts against the Nazis.         A longtime friend and associate of Golda Meir, who was also a schoolteacher, Miss Syrkin published ''Golda Meir: Woman With a Cause'' - a three-volume biography of the Israeli Prime Minister - in 1964. She was a prolific writer for such periodicals as Midstream, Commentary, The Saturday Review, The New York Times Magazine and The New Republic. Her final volume was a collection of essays from those and other magazines entitled ''The State of the Jews,'' published in 1980.         From 1965 to 1969 Miss Syrkin was on the executive body of the World Zionist Movement and during that period was honorary president of the Labor Zionist Movement in the United States.         Miss Syrkin was married to the poet Charles Reznikoff, who died in 1976.         She is survived by a son, David Bodansky of Seattle; a sister, Zivia Wurtele of Santa Monica; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         Barbara W. Tuchman, whose skill at writing histories of men at war and on the brink of war won her two Pulitzer Prizes, died of complications of a stroke yesterday afternoon at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and was admitted to the hospital Saturday after suffering the stroke at her home at Cos Cob, Conn.         It was Mrs. Tuchman's fourth book, ''The Guns of August,'' a study of the background and beginning of World War I, that made her a celebrity after it came out in 1962, winning reviewers' salutes, a durable niche on best-seller lists and her first Pulitzer Prize.         The second Pulitzer came for ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45.'' The 1971 biography of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, a hard-driving American officer who played a major role in China during World War II, was combined with a history of modern China. Her other books included ''The Zimmermann Telegram,'' ''The Proud Tower'' and ''A Distant Mirror.'' Latest Book a Best Seller         Her most recent book, ''The First Salute,'' sets the American Revolution in international perspective. It has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 17 weeks, and last week was No. 9.         Born into a New York family that had long been eminent in finance and public service, Mrs. Tuchman could have had an easy, conventional life as the wife of a prominent physician. But as her three daughters grew older, she took up the historian's profession.         She had neither an academic title nor even a graduate degree. ''It's what saved me,'' she later said. ''If I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any writing capacity.'' Her Primary Obstacle         But to be a writer was difficult, she found, simply because she was a woman. ''If a man is a writer,'' she once said, ''everybody tiptoes around past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not professional.' ''         In fact, Mrs. Tuchman had a firm, even contentious, sense of her vocation. In history and biography, she told an audience at the National Portrait Gallery in 1978, ''the writer's object is - or should be - to hold the reader's attention.''         ''I want the reader to turn the page and keep on turning to the end,'' she added. ''This is accomplished only when the narrative moves steadily ahead, not when it comes to a weary standstill, overloaded with every item uncovered in the research.'' An Impression of Authority         In her person as well as in her choice of words, Mrs. Tuchman gave an impression of authority. She had strong features, a high forehead, wise hazel eyes and a somewhat serious manner that gave way, now and then, to a dazzling smile.         Summing up her view of the historical process, she wrote in 1981, in the preface to ''Practicing History,'' a selection of her short writings, that she had arrived at ''a sense of history as accidental and perhaps cyclical, of human conduct as a steady stream running through endless fields of changing circumstances, of good and bad always coexisting and inextricably mixed in periods as in people, of cross-currents and counter-currents usually present to contradict too-easy generalizations.''         Lofty though her views might be, Mrs. Tuchman was down to earth in her research. Before she wrote ''The Guns of August,'' she rented a Renault sedan and toured the appropriate battlefields. When she took notes, it was always on index cards measuring 4 by 6 inches - a convenient size, she said, for storing in shoeboxes and carrying in her purse.         That sort of prosaic concern was far from her exalted birthright. Barbara Wertheim was born on Jan. 30, 1912, in New York, the daughter of Maurice Wertheim, an investment banker, art collector and philanthropist, and Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, a sister of Henry Morgenthau Jr., who was Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Miss Wertheim attended the Walden School before entering Radcliffe College, where she concentrated on history and literature and received her bachelor's degree in 1933. Worked in Japan         Since, as she put it, ''paying jobs did not hang from the trees'' in that Depression year, she took an unpaid position with the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         The following year, she went to Tokyo to help work up an economic handbook of the Pacific area. While there, she wrote for two journals, Far Eastern Survey and Pacific Affairs.         An early contribution was a review of a French historian's book about Japan. Not long after it was printed, she later recalled: ''I was thrilled to receive from the author a letter addressed 'Chere consoeur' (the feminine of confrere, or as we would say, 'colleague'). I felt admitted into an international circle of professionals.''         In 1936, Miss Wertheim went to work for The Nation, which her father had bought to keep it from going bankrupt. Her first job was clipping newspaper articles, but soon she was writing herself, and in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, she went to Valencia and Madrid as The Nation's correspondent. 'Heroes, Hopes, and Illusions'         From Spain she traveled elsewhere in Europe, savoring what she later called ''a somber, exciting, believing, betraying time, with heroes, hopes, and illusions.''         In London, she put together a short book, ''The Lost British Policy,'' about British policy toward Spain and the Western Mediterranean. Her later appraisal of the work, which came out in 1938, was that it was only ''a respectable piece of research,'' and she sometimes omitted it in listing her books.         By 1939, she was back in New York, writing largely on Spain, and the next year she married Dr. Lester Reginald Tuchman, a New York internist.         Mrs. Tuchman was soon showing her strength of will. With Nazi Germany looming, she later wrote, her husband ''not unreasonably felt at that time that the world was too unpromising to bring children into.         ''Sensible for once, I argued that if we waited for the outlook to improve, we might wait forever, and that if we wanted a child at all we should have it now, regardless of Hitler.''         ''The tyranny of men not being quite as total as today's feminists would have us believe,'' she added, writing in 1981, ''our first daughter was born nine months later.'' Separated by Wartime         After Pearl Harbor, Dr. Tuchman went overseas to a United States military hospital, and Mrs. Tuchman got a job in New York with the Office of War Information, preparing material on the Far East for use in broadcasts to Europe.         ''After the war, when my husband came home, we had two more children, and domesticity for a while prevailed,'' she wrote later, ''combined with beginning the work I had always wanted to do, which was writing a book.''         ''When the children were very small,'' she once recalled in an interview, ''I worked in the morning only and then gradually, as they spent full days at school, I could spend full days at work. I could never have done any of this work if I hadn't been able to afford domestic help.''         The fruit of those labors, ''Bible and Sword,'' about relations between Britain and Palestine, came out in 1956. It attracted relatively little notice, though what there was of it was favorable.         Two years later ''The Zimmermann Telegram'' appeared, about a message sent from Berlin to a German diplomat in Mexico in January 1917, raising the possibility of ''an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona,'' and about the message's repercussions after it was intercepted and made public by the British.         Writing in The New York Times, Samuel Flagg Bemis, the Yale diplomatic historian, said the value and importance of the book lay in Mrs. Tuchman's ''brilliant use of well known materials, her sureness of insight and her competent grasp of a complicated chapter of diplomatic history.'' 'The Guns of August'         Attempting something that might have seemed a bit beyond her reach, Mrs. Tuchman took up a far broader and more important topic in her next book, which was ''The Guns of August.'' World War I, as she saw it, was no less than ''the chasm between our world and a world that died forever.''         Though the book was largely about arms and men, it was also about aspirations and ideals. ''Men,'' she concluded, in one widely quoted passage, ''could not sustain a war of such magnitude and pain without hope - the hope that its very enormity would insure that it could never happen again.''         Clifton Fadiman, writing in the Book-of-the-Month-Club News, said: ''Its virtues are almost Thucydidean: intelligence, concision, weight, detachment.''         Writing in The New York Times, Cyril Falls, a British officer turned military historian, said Mrs. Tuchman ''writes so brilliantly and inspiringly.'' The book, he said, was ''lucid, fair, critical and witty.''         But he contended that her performance was uneven, and ''the errors and omissions amount to a formidable total.'' For his part, Bruce Bliven, writing in The New Yorker, complained that ''Mrs. Tuchman leans toward seeing issues as black and white.'' Emphasized Human Qualities         The book's emphasis on the human qualities of the leaders of the time helped make it popular with the public, and it served as the basis for a 1964 documentary film, produced by Nathan Kroll, with the same title.         The quarter-century preceding World War I was the subject of Mrs. Tuchman's next book, ''The Proud Tower,'' which came out in 1966. In a review in The New York Times, Martin Duberman, a Princeton history professor, praised her skill at narrating events, making historical personages come alive, and writing clearly and powerfully about complex matters.         But he said the book did ''not come up to the high level of 'The Guns of August.' '' It was not a portrait of the period, he contended, but merely ''random brush strokes, leaving a canvas unoccupied by any ruling vision.''         When ''Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45,'' came out, it was hailed as ''brilliant'' in a review in The New Republic by the dean of American China scholars, John K. Fairbank, the director of Harvard University's East Asian Research Center. 'A Distant Mirror'         Another book about Asia, ''Notes From China,'' a slim volume about a six-week trip Mrs. Tuchman had taken, appeared in 1972. But six years went by before the appearance of her next work, ''A Distant Mirror,'' a study of the 14th century, an era that was racked by plague and war.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Eric Cochrane, a professor of history at the University of Chicago, said, ''This book abounds in the same elements that have made her previous books masterpieces of popular scholarship: vivid battle scenes, scenes from daily life, brilliant portraits.'' But he also argued that she was guilty of grave omissions and misinterpretations.         In ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,'' a 1984 book, Mrs. Tuchman scrutinized the Trojans' decision to admit the Greek horse into their city, the refusal of six Renaissance Popes to arrest church corruption in advance of the Protestant Reformation, British misrule under King George III and America's mishandling of the Vietnam conflict.         Mrs. Tuchman had an occasional fondness for twitting figures of authority. She once began a speech to the Army War College by noting that her subject, generalship, had been suggested by the college's commandant.         ''No doubt,'' she observed, ''he could safely assume that the subject in itself would automatically interest this audience in the same way that motherhood would interest an audience of pregnant ladies.''         Mrs. Tuchman is survived by her husband, who is an emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine; a sister, Anne W. Werner of Manhattan; three daughters, Lucy T. Eisenberg of Los Angeles, Jessica Tuchman Mathews of Washington, and Alma Tuchman of Cos Cob and Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is be held at 2 P.M. Sunday in the Celeste Bartos Forum at the main branch of the New York Public Library.

        Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Miss Enters became internationally known during the 1920's for an individual style of dance-mime that Stark Young described as ''free of influences foreign to her nature.'' She specialized in character vignettes, frequently described as wordless monologues, developing nearly 300 separate characters for her touring Theater of Angna Enters from 1928 to 1960.         Her range of subjects was wide, from sharply specific satires on politics and the arts to portraits of ordinary young women. ''To my way of thinking, the greatest quality about Angna Enters is her unfetteredness,'' the dance critic Walter Terry wrote in 1946. In her 1926 ''Moyen Age,'' one of her best-known pieces, Miss Enters seemed to have stepped out of a medieval painting as she enacted a woman's reactions to stories of events in the life of Christ, in a series of fluid poses to music by Frescobaldi. Also an Artist and Sculptor         Miss Enters was also a well-known artist and sculptor who held her first New York exhibition in 1933. She designed and executed all the costumes and props for her performances, and illustrated several of the books she wrote on her life and her work. She also composed scores for some of her pieces.         Miss Enters was born in New York City of an Austrian father and French mother, and spent her childhood in Milwaukee and traveling through Europe. She returned to New York in 1922 to enroll at the Art Students' League, where she studied with John Sloan while doing lettering in an advertising agency during the daytime.         Miss Enters had studied ballet in Milwaukee as she had studied piano, she once said, ''to become 'accomplished.' '' Her adult interest in dance began with a concern for the visual representation of movement. First Dance Work in 1923         She enrolled in dance classes taught by Michio Ito in 1922, and performed as his partner in a series of recitals in 1923. That year she created her first piece, ''Ecclesiastique,'' an evocation of a statue of a Gothic Virgin, which she performed in a Broadway revue organized by Ito. The piece later became ''Moyen Age.'' She presented her first solo program in 1924 at the Greenwich Village Theater with a borrowed $25 as her operating budget.         Her reputation grew rapidly over the next two years, and Miss Enters made her London debut in 1928, performing for the first time in Paris the following year.         Miss Enters wrote three volumes of autobiography - ''First Person Plural,'' ''Silly Girl'' and ''Artist's Life'' - a novel, ''Among the Daughters'' (1956), and a book about her work, ''On Mime,'' published in 1966. Her plays, ''Love Possessed Juana: A Play of the Inquisition in Spain'' and ''The Unknown Lover,'' were presented by the Houston Little Theater in 1946 and 1947. A University Lecturer         A noted master teacher, Miss Enters lectured at universities throughout the country. In the early 1960's, she was an artist in residence at the Dallas Theater Center and Baylor University and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.         Miss Enters retired from performing in 1960, and had been in nursing homes since 1976. There are no survivors.       
        Laurie Shields, co-founder of the Older Women's League, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 67 years old.         Laurie Shields, co-founder of the Older Women's League, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 67 years old.         Born in Chicago, Mrs. Shields graduated from the University of Wisconsin. After her husband died in 1970, she co-founded the Alliance for Displaced Homemakers, later the Displaced Homemakers Network, for women who had spent their careers as homemakers and had lost their husbands, and thus their incomes, through divorce or death. She worked for the National Organization for Women as coordinator for displaced homemaker organizations, many of which were established in the 1970's.         At the time, Mrs. Shields noted: ''We're in our middle years and caught in an era of rising expectations for women that we're not prepared for. What we need is help in that transition period between dependency and self-sufficiency.''         She was an organizer of the White House Mini-Conference on Older Women in 1980. At her death she was a member of the board of directors of the Older Women's League, based in Washington.         Initially, the organization was run from her home. Among its goals were improving low-cost health care insurance for older women and giving women more equitable treatment under the Social Security laws.         Mrs. Shields was the author of ''Displaced Homemakers: Organizing for a New Life,'' published in 1981 by McGraw-Hill, and the co-author of ''Women Take Care: The Consequences of Caregiving in Today's Society,'' published in 1987 by Triad Publishing Company.         She was the widow of Arthur Shields, an actor. Surviving are a daughter, Christine, of Oakland, and a sister, June McVeigh, of Sarasota, Fla.       
        Jean Walker Macfarlane, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley, died of congestive heart failure March 4 at her home in Berkeley. She was 95 years old.         Jean Walker Macfarlane, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley, died of congestive heart failure March 4 at her home in Berkeley. She was 95 years old.         In 1922, Mrs. Macfarlane became the second person to earn a doctoral degree in psychology at Berkeley. She founded the school's Institute of Human Development, originally called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927.         In 1928 she inaugurated the Guidance Study, a lifelong study of 250 individuals born that year that still continues. It provided a body of information on normal personality development. Until then psychology had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities.         She was a former president of the California Psychological Association, and winner of the American Psychological Association's highest honor in developmental psychology.         There are no immediate survivors.

Katha Quinn, the sports-information director at St. John's University, died of liver cancer yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 34 years old.         Ms. Quinn, a 1976 graduate of St. John's, began her career in 1978 as the school's assistant sports-information director. She became the director in 1983, when it was still unusual for a woman to be the sports-information director for a major college athletic program. She also helped coordinate news-media services at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984.         She is survived by her parents, Charles and Maria Quinn of Old Westbury, L.I.; a sister, Odilie Esposito of Westbury, L.I., and a brother, Timothy of East Northport, L.I.

She was 91 years old and since 1976 had been a resident at the Presbyterian Home in Hightstown, N.J.         Mrs. Schirber, a 1938 graduate of the New York University School of Social Work, was executive director of the Middlesex County Tuberculosis and Health League from 1922 until her retirement in 1969.         She was a founder of the Middlesex County Mental Health Association and also established the Kiddie Keep Well Camp in Edison, N.J. She received distinguished service awards in 1938 and 1946 from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.         She is survived by her son, Eric, of Skillman, N.J.; two brothers, E. Vernon Packard of Edison and Preston K. Packard of Blue Bell, Pa., and two grandchildren.

Lynn Ceci, an anthropologist and a professor at Queens College and at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, died of liver cancer yesterday at her home in Locust Valley, L.I. She was 58 years old.         Dr. Ceci, a graduate of City University, earned her Ph.D. in 1977. She joined the faculty at Queens College in 1978 and began teaching at the Graduate Center in 1987.         She was an expert on wampum, beads made from mollusk shells and used as money by American Indians in the beaver trade. In her doctoral dissertation she showed how the British ended Dutch dominance of the fur trade by capturing the Pequot Indian wampum makers.         She is survived by her husband, Joseph; a daughter, Christine Bagley of Hampton, Va.; two sons, Vincent, of Minneapolis, and Timothy, of Chicago, and four grandchildren.

        Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920 and, over the years, turned it into an international literary haven. It is still thriving at 41 West 47th Street in Manhattan, an anachronism in a time of failing independent bookstores.         Soon after the store opened, it attracted authors, dramatists, poets and artists. Among those who came to chat, to browse and to see if their books and plays were on the shelves were Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, H. L. Mencken and Eugene O'Neill. Her customers included George and Ira Gershwin, Ina Claire and Charlie Chaplin, and, more recently, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, John Guare and Garson Kanin.         She championed the experimental and challenged the censors. Her courage in purchasing shipments of the banned ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' directly from D. H. Lawrence in Italy in the late 1920's and in ordering smuggled copies of ''Tropic of Cancer'' from Henry Miller in Paris during the 1930's led to lawsuits and landmark decisions on censorship.         Although Miss Steloff sold the Gotham in 1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, she continued to live in an apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working consultant. She ignored her age and her semiretirement, descending every afternoon to sit at a desk in her own corner, occasionally jumping up to press books on browsers, and then to direct them to the cash register. Browsers Welcome         Essentially a person of no literary pretensions, Miss Steloff made her bookstore a place cherished as the habitat for the new and the avant-garde in literature, where small magazines and forgotten books of poetry, out-of-print books on belles-lettres and works on film and the theater could be found in an atmosphere congenial to browsers.         Under her guidance the Gotham became a meeting place for the literati and a bibliophile's paradise. The number of well-known writers, dancers, artists and theater people who were her customers, clients and friends made up an encyclopedia of 20th-century culture. At her 100th birthday celebration, on Dec. 31, 1987, greetings arrived from all over the world.         Miss Steloff was one of the founders of the James Joyce Society, which still meets at the Gotham, although she never met the author. ''Sylvia Beach took care of his book wants at Shakespeare & Company in Paris,'' she said. ''But sometimes Joyce ordered books from the Gotham directly by mail - including during the last year of his life.''         After working in several bookstores, she opened her own on West 45th Street in 1920. The store moved twice to larger quarters. ''It was a struggle at the beginning,'' she recalled. ''There were some days during the Depression when we didn't sell a single book.'' An Interest in the Mystical         ''I am not the great brilliant person to decide about how good a book is,'' she said once. ''I judge books by my customers who buy them and spark others to read them.'' She was greatly interested in Oriental teachings, mystical experiences and philosophers not connected with established Western churches. Books in these fields were represented in her corner of the store.         Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully operated book business. As the owner and the person who paid the salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much concentration into the store as she did.         Miss Steloff recalled some of the clerks who had worked for the Gotham over the years. ''There was Allen Ginsberg and LeRoi Jones and many poets in their youth,'' she said. ''Tennessee Williams lasted less than a day - he couldn't get here on time in the morning and, also, he wasn't very good at wrapping packages.'' Sold Flowers in Hotels         Ida Frances Steloff was born Dec. 31, 1887, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a town full of gaiety in the summer and a bleak, wintry place for the rest of the year, especially for the poor. The Steloffs, who lived year round in Saratoga Springs, were among the very poor. When Miss Stefloff was little, she sold flowers on the verandas of the big hotels. The early death of her mother increased her misery, especially when her stepmother expressed her frustrations with poverty in the harshness she showed the children.         At 12, Miss Steloff was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. But she soon found herself a menial in the household and was forced to drop out of the seventh grade - her last formal schooling. Once in desperation she ran away to New York City. It was not until she was 19 that she made a final move to New York. She landed a job at Loeser's, a Brooklyn department store, working in ''corsets.'' But during the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the books department.         It was like giving a copy of Euclid to Isaac Newton: She had found herself and a way of life.         For the next 12 years she worked in various bookstores: Schulte, Brentano and McDevitt-Wilson, where she developed what one friend called ''an instinctive taste for the best in modern literature,'' a taste that she was willing to gamble on when she had her own shop. She never referred to Gotham as a store; it was always a ''shop.''         Her stature concealed her stamina. She ran the place, but she also opened the correspondence, wrapped and mailed packages, climbed up and down ladders and argued with publishers. Bookstore people were continually helping her down from ladders in her 80's. ''She feels,'' Mr. Brown said, ''as if she still has to stock the store.'' A Doctorate From Skidmore         Miss Steloff was awarded a prize by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for distinguished service to the arts, was listed in Who's Who in the Theater and received an honorary doctorate from Skidmore College - an award that stood in sharp contrast to one of her remarks:         ''I used to feel bitter and cheated about not having a formal education. But why should I? How could I, no matter what my education, ever have had the wonderful chance to have Thornton Wilder and other people talk to me personally, and right here in my shop! As if they were in their classrooms! I couldn't ask for anything more.''         A battle to save the bookstore ended last February, when Mr. Brown bought the building that houses the store from the American Friends of the Hebrew University Foundation. With the $1 million proceeds, the foundation has established a scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the name of Miss Steloff's parents.         It was quiet yesterday at the cozy bookstore, with a sprinkling of students and literary buffs brousing through the volumes. In the hall on the second floor hung oversized photographs of Miss Steloff - with Dylan Thomas in 1952, Anais Nin in 1966, Jean Cocteau in 1948, Salvador Dali in 1963, Marianne Moore in 1967. Memorial Service Is Planned         Although funeral arrangements were not yet complete, Mr. Brown said yesterday that Miss Steloff would be buried Monday in the family plot in the Jewish Cemetery at Saratoga Springs.         The Gotham will be closed on that day in her memory. Mr. Brown said he would post a sign and pictures of Miss Steloff in the bookstore window. A memorial service is to be held in three or four weeks, he said.         On May 11, Miss Steloff was to have been presented Brandeis University's Notable Achievement Award.         Miss Steloff was married to David Moss in 1923. They were divorced in 1930 and had no children.         Surviving are a half sister, Belle Sidoroff, of Wilmington, Del., and a half brother, Al Steloff, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.       
        Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, the retired head librarian of the New York Botanical Garden, died of heart failure Wednesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 91 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Elizabeth Cornelia Hall, the retired head librarian of the New York Botanical Garden, died of heart failure Wednesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 91 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Hall used to say that she was just no good at retiring. She tried it once, at 70. But she promptly went to work for the Horticultural Society of New York as its librarian emeritus. She returned to the New York Botanical Garden in 1982, in its plant-information service, dispensing advice on dubious mushrooms and sympathy to people with terminal plants.         Once, when a caller asked how she might kill a tree without her husband's knowledge, Miss Hall replied, ''Well, you could kill your husband first.''         She worked at the plant-information service five days a week until January.         Officially, Miss Hall was the Botanical Garden's head librarian for 23 years, from 1937 to 1960. She worked as a research librarian for an additional three years, then became curator of education before attempting retirement in 1967. 'The Gentle Side'         Vigorous and energetic, Miss Hall made three trips to China while in her 80's and continued reading at least one book a week. ''I go to bed around midnight and get up at 7 A.M.,'' she explained, ''and I don't use up energy with makeup, hairdos or manicures.''         She inspired and nurtured America's leading garden writers and horticulturists. ''Helping people to learn about, care for and enjoy plants has given me a joyous life,'' she said on her 90th birthday. ''Plants bring out the gentle side of people.''         For her 90th birthday, the New York Botanical Garden, plus the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Horticultural Society of New York, the New York branch of the Herb Society of America and Wave Hill, paid tribute to her at a birthday party, attesting to the fact that Miss Hall had become an indispensible reference work herself.         Born in Meriden, Conn., she graduated from Radcliffe College and earned a certificate from the Ambler School of Horticulture, now part of Temple University, and a master's degree from Columbia University.         Before joining the Botanical Garden, Miss Hall had been the librarian at the Horticultural Society of New York. She had previously worked as a children's librarian for the New York Public Library.         She aided generations of horticulturists, who admired her wisdom and were amused by her quirks. ''Hers has been an enthusiastic force amongst her worldwide colleagues,'' wrote Charles D. Webster, former president of the Horticultural Society.         Miss Hall loved horse racing. She kept a well-organized card catalogue of promising 2-year-olds, which she called ''my sleepers,'' and she went to the track with relish. ''Here I was, supposed to be a perfectly old-maid, New England librarian,'' said Miss Hall, in no danger of becoming a stereotype. She delighted in telling of once having won the daily double.         She left no survivors.

        Gilda Radner, the Emmy Award-winning comedian who created the nasal-voiced broadcaster Roseanne Roseannadanna, the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Loopner and the bumbling complainer Emily Litella for the television show ''Saturday Night Live,'' died of cancer early yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 42 years old.         Gilda Radner, the Emmy Award-winning comedian who created the nasal-voiced broadcaster Roseanne Roseannadanna, the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Loopner and the bumbling complainer Emily Litella for the television show ''Saturday Night Live,'' died of cancer early yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 42 years old.         ''There's a preciseness to her parody,'' the critic Molly Haskell once said of Miss Radner. ''Like Dickens, she's added people to the world who bear her stamp. And even when she's tasteless you don't wince. There's something very gentle and sweet in Gilda that comes through.''         As a guest editorialist on ''Saturday Night Live's'' parody of the weekend news, Miss Radner, in the character of Miss Litella, would rail against broadcasters for paying too much attention to ''endangered feces.'' And only when it was made clear to her that the subject was ''endangered species'' would she back off, mewling, ''Never mind.'' Other topics that enraged her included conservation of national race horses, preoccupation with violins on television and concern for Soviet jewelry.         Besides her standard ''Never mind,'' Miss Radner coined the catch phrase for the scatterbrained Roseanne Roseannadanna, ''It's always something,'' which became the title of a book she wrote detailing her fight with ovarian cancer. By Her Side         Miss Radner, whose illness was diagnosed two and a half years ago, died in her sleep about 6:20 A.M. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said. Her husband of five years, the actor and filmmaker Gene Wilder, was at her side.         ''I loved her like a sister; my thoughts are with Gene and her family,'' said Dan Aykroyd, a fellow ''Saturday Night'' star. Mr. Aykroyd's comments were relayed by a spokeswoman, Susan Patricola.         Miss Radner, who won the Emmy as the outstanding actress in a variety series, was reared in a quasi-theatrical family in Detroit. ''My father had a hotel,'' she once told an interviewer, ''and people in show business used to stay there. He loved peformers and entertainment, and I grew up knowing that. Some of his spunk must have come out in me, because he used to love to perform, too. He was funny, he could tell a good story, he could do magic tricks.''         When Gilda was 12, her father became terminally ill. Two years later, he died and left her a large estate. Majored in Drama         She majored in drama at the University of Michigan, dropped out and followed a boyfriend to Canada, where she landed a role in the Toronto production of ''Godspell'' and later with the comedy revue ''Second City.'' In 1974 she came to New York to do ''The National Lampoon Radio Hour'' and ''The National Lampoon Show.''         Soon after, Lorne Michaels, the creator of ''Saturday Night Live,'' began putting together the show. He had seen some of Miss Radner's work. ''I felt there was a remarkable quality to her, a goodness which came through whatever she was doing,'' he said. When, in 1975, he was ready to sign on cast members, he chose Miss Radner first.         In 1979, Miss Radner took her television characters - including Baba Wawa, a spoof of Barbara Walters - to Broadway, where she appeared at the Winter Garden in a revue ''Gilda Live.'' The production was then filmed and released as a movie. In Several Films         After ''Saturday Night Live'' she appeared in several films, including ''First Family'' and ''The Woman in Red,'' a 1984 hit written and directed by her co-star and future husband, Mr. Wilder. She also appeared in ''Haunted Honeymoon,'' ''Hanky Panky'' and ''It Came From Hollywood.''         Miss Radner also starred in a dramatic role on Broadway in the play ''Lunch Hour'' with Sam Waterston, in 1980. ''Wanna know my biggest fear?'' she asked just before a performance of the Jean Kerr play. ''It's that I'll come out and someone in the audience will yell, 'Hey, Gilda! Do Roseanne Roseannadanna!' ''         Funeral services will be private.

        Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         The San Clemente General Hospital issued a statement saying Miss Jorgensen's death followed a long bout with bladder and lung cancer.         Miss Jorgensen was born in the Westchester section of the Bronx on May 20, 1926, and was named George Jorgensen Jr. In her book, ''Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Biography,'' published in 1967, Miss Jorgensen said she had a normal, happy childhood but on growing up became frustrated by feelings that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. A Sensation in Tabloids         As George Jorgensen, she served as a clerk in the Army. After being honorably discharged, she decided to seek a sex change operation.         Her sexual conversion began with hormone injections in 1950, when she was 24 years old. It was completed in 1952 with surgery at the Danish State Hospital in Copenhagen under the care of Dr. Christian Hamburger, a Danish hormone expert whose first name she took to form her own.         On her return to the United States in 1955, her transsexualism was sensationalized in the daily tabloids, some of which she gave exclusive interviews.         One tabloid headline read, ''Bronx GI Becomes a Woman!'' and went on, ''Dear Mum and Dad, Son Wrote, I Have Now Become Your Daughter.''         The New York Times carried a five-paragraph Associated Press story headlined, ''Bronx 'Boy' Is Now A Girl.''         ''At first I was very self-conscious and very awkward,'' Miss Jorgensen said in an interview in 1970. ''But once the notoriety hit, it did not take me long to adjust.''         Miss Jorgensen was the first transsexual in the United States to publicly announce her change of sexual identity. Rather than withdraw from public attention, she turned the notoriety to her advantage with a series of lucrative tours on the lecture and nightclub circuit. Her nightclub act featured the theme song, ''I Enjoy Being a Girl.''         ''I decided if they wanted to see me, they would have to pay for it,'' she said. Chose Not to Marry         She made headlines again in 1959 when she sought, but was denied, a license to marry because her birth certificate said she was a male. She later chose not to marry. She could not have had children.         In an interview last year, she said she never regretted her decision to change sexes. She linked the public reaction to her decision, in part, to the awakening that led to the sexual revolution of the 1950's and 1960's.         But as a person who had experienced both sides of the issue, she said in an interview in 1972 that she did not understand the women's liberation movement.         Discussing the subject with a group of students at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, Miss Jorgensen said: ''I don't know very many women who arent't liberated. Men need liberation too.''         For the last 20 years, she lived in California, the last two in San Clemente.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy, and two nieces.

Hibari Misora, known as ''the queen'' of Japanese singers, died of heart failure today after a long illness. She was 52 years old.         Born Kazue Kato, Miss Misora's stage name means ''skylark beautiful sky.'' From the time in 1948 when she made her debut, at age 11, her songs cheered people left hopeless by Japan's defeat in World War II.         Masao Yamaguchi, a professor at Tokyo Foreign Language University, credited Miss Misora with a role in helping the nation's recovery and economic growth in the postwar era.

        Lisa Sergio, a pioneer radio news broadcaster in Mussolini's Italy who became a dedicated anti-Fascist and a news commentator for WQXR and other American radio stations, died of a heart attack Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 84 years old.         Lisa Sergio, a pioneer radio news broadcaster in Mussolini's Italy who became a dedicated anti-Fascist and a news commentator for WQXR and other American radio stations, died of a heart attack Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 84 years old.         Miss Sergio, a slender, fiery contralto once known as ''the Golden Voice of Rome,'' also translated the dictator's blustering speeches into English and French almost simultaneously on the air until her modifications of propaganda commentaries prompted her dismissal from Rome radio.         Faced with arrest and internment in 1937, she was smuggled aboard a trans-Atlantic liner by a family friend, Guglielmo Marconi, the radio developer. She settled in New York City, where she soon became a guest observer for NBC radio and the host for broadcasts including Metropolitan Opera performances and Berkshire music festivals.         She then became one of the few female news commentators with her own program, broadcasting seven times a week on WQXR from 1939 to 1946, when the station dropped single news commentaries in favor of forum talks. 'Mental Honesty'         ''Lisa Sergio was a most attractive personality both on and off the air,'' said Elliott M. Sanger, a founder and longtime executive of the station. In his 1973 book about WQXR, ''Rebel in Radio,'' he hailed her comments on foreign news and cultural events.         Miss Sergio was a fervent advocate of democracy, free speech and feminism. Analyzing her broadcasts, she said, ''Mental honesty is essential because the microphone has a strange and impolite way of sending over the airwaves not only what the commentators say, but also what they think.''         The commentator was born Elisa Sergio in Florence to Baron Agostino Sergio, a landowner, and the former Margaret FitzGerald of Baltimore.         With no professional background, she soon became the editor of Italian Mail, an English literary weekly in Florence, worked as a freelance writer and researched and wrote on archeology. After her broadcasting career in Rome and New York, she taught propaganda analysis at Columbia University, lectured widely at American colleges and wrote several books, including ''I Am My Beloved: the Life of Anita Garibaldi'' (1965). She was also a board member or trustee of many philanthropic and cultural groups.         There are no immediate survivors.

        Antonia Brico, a conductor who led her own orchestras in New York in the 1930's and who devoted her life to fighting prejudice against women in the orchestral world, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 87 years old and had lived at the Bella Vita Towers, a nursing home in Denver, since 1988.         Antonia Brico, a conductor who led her own orchestras in New York in the 1930's and who devoted her life to fighting prejudice against women in the orchestral world, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 87 years old and had lived at the Bella Vita Towers, a nursing home in Denver, since 1988.         Miss Brico, who was the subject of the 1974 film ''Antonia: Portrait of a Conductor,'' made her way in the male-dominated musical world largely through the force of her personality as well as her unshakable determination and a facility with both the standard orchestral literature and contemporary American works.         Those qualities helped her break many barriers. In 1930 she became the first woman to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. Seven years later she became the first woman to conduct an opera performance by a major New York company when she led the New York Hippodrome Opera production of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' And in 1938 she made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, becoming the first woman to conduct that orchestra.         She had mixed feelings about these distinctions, however. ''I do not call myself a woman conductor,'' she said in interviews. ''I call myself a conductor who happens to be a woman.'' Moved to U.S. at 6         Miss Brico was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on June 26, 1902. Her family moved to Oakland, Calif., when she was 6 years old. She intended to be a pianist at first, but in 1919 she enrolled at the University of California, where she took a liberal arts degree in 1923. During her student years, she supported herself by playing piano recitals and became interested in conducting while working as an assistant to Paul Steindorff, the director of the San Francisco Opera.         In 1927, she went to Berlin to study conducting at the Berlin State Academy of Music. Among her teachers was Karl Muck, a former director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who was then conducting the Hamburg Philharmonic and who helped her obtain a coaching position at Bayreuth.         When she made her Berlin Philharmonic debut in 1930, the critic of the Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that she ''possesses more ability, cleverness and musicianship than certain of her male colleagues who bore us in Berlin.'' Later that year she conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic but failed to win a conducting post she sought there. After a successful tour of Poland and the Balkans, she returned to New York, where she made her debut conducting the Musicians' Symphony Orchestra. She Founded Her Own         Miss Brico continued to seek a conducting post with one of the established orchestras in the United States, and when she did not succeed, she founded an ensemble of her own, the Women's Symphony Orchestra, which flourished from 1935 until 1939, when it became the Brico Symphony Orchestra.         When her career in New York began to falter, around 1940, she moved to Denver, where she taught and was a guest conductor. In 1947 she became director of the Denver Businessmen's Symphony, which was later renamed the Brico Symphony. She held that post until she retired from conducting in 1985. She also directed the Denver Opera Association, the Women's String Orchestra and the Boulder Philharmonic and was active as a teacher. One of her students in the 1950's was Judy Collins, who became famous as a folksinger in the late 1960's and who directed the ''Antonia'' film.         Miss Collins's film rekindled interest in Miss Brico. When she returned to New York to conduct the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra in 1975, her single scheduled concert sold out so quickly that a second was added. CBS recorded her concerts for release on LP. Her last New York appearances were in 1977, when she performed with the Brooklyn Philharmonia.         There are no survivors.         Correction:  August 18, 1989, Friday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Aug. 5 about the conductor Antonia Brico misidentified a film on her life and credited it incompletely. The film was ''Antonia: A Portrait of the Woman,'' and Jill Godmilow was a co-director with Judy Collins.

        Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         As one of the city's earliest and most notable female lawyers, Mrs. Buttenwieser bore the admiration of younger generations modestly, with self-deprecating humor and candor. When the City Bar Association honored her last year at an annual dinner, she noted dryly, ''I'd rather be reading a book.''         As a scion of a powerful family, she followed in its tradition of advocacy, philanthropy and concern for social issues. ''Public service is an obligation,'' Mrs. Buttenwieser once declared. 'Embodied the Concept'         Two passions ruled her professional life: the law and civil liberties. They merged when she became the first chairwoman of the Legal Aid Society, an organization she served for more than 50 years.         ''She embodied the concept of public service, and that her profession recognize its responsibility to people unable to represent themselves,'' said Alexander D. Forger, the current chairman of the Legal Aid Society and chairman of the Manhattan law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. As Legal Aid's first chairwoman, she nevertheless insisted on being referred to as chairman, rather than chairperson.         ''That was her style,'' Mr. Forger said. ''She was of the old school, where matters of gender were less important than doing the job.''         Mrs. Buttenwieser, who was born in Manhattan, was the daughter of two leading figures of ''our crowd,'' the 100 or so German Jewish families who founded leading banking, securities and retailing empires. Her mother, Adele Lewisohn, was the daughter of Adolph Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. Her uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, was a New York Governor and a United States Senator from New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, was Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals. Worked in Settlement House         After two years at Connecticut College, she left and enrolled at the New York School of Social Work. Then, she worked in child guidance in a settlement house. In 1930, she was appointed to the Board of Child Welfare. She turned to the law when she aspired to a judgeship in what is now Family Court.         In 1929, she married Benjamin J. Buttenwieser, a partner in the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. In a typical ''our crowd'' twist, one of her husband's partners wed her sister, and the firm later merged with Lehman Brothers, the family firm.         She graduated from New York University Law School and became the first woman to work at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. She left after a year because of the impending birth of a child.         Mrs. Buttenwieser then set out to fashion a life that would enable her to fuse work, family and community service. She founded her own office and practiced law in Manhattan for 50 years, until she retired in 1986. ''I decided when you get to be 80, you retire,'' she said. A Busy Volunteer         Her volunteer activities continued throughout her life and included many firsts. In 1939, she was the first chairwoman of a standing committee of the New York County Bar Association. Ten years later, she was elected trustee of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company, the first female director of a prominent banking concern.         She was chairwoman of the New York City Committee on Adoptions and often served as a pro bono lawyer for children's aid organizations. Mrs. Buttenwieser and her husband frequently opened their home to foster children.         When asked how she had been able to accomplish so much, she often credited ''a good husband.'' The two were a familiar sight at their regular table at Le Perigord, where they dined every Saturday at 8 P.M. precisely and where they recently celebrated their 60th anniversary.         Mr. Buttenwieser, a prominent philanthropist and civic leader, nurtured his wife's career and shared her causes. Mrs. Buttenwieser, as a tireless defender of Alger Hiss, the former State Department official who was convicted of perjury in 1950 after trials that mesmerized the nation, was the host for Sunday brunches at her home, where the defendant and his advisers and friends would gather. 'Fundamental Values'         ''She was a woman of great spirit and fundamental values - human rights, decency and the quality of individuals,'' said Oscar M. Ruebhausen, a longtime neighbor and retired partner of Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm that defended Mr. Hiss.         Mrs. Buttenwieser put her money where her beliefs were. She was an investor in The Nation, the liberal magazine. She formed a coalition of small family foundations, Joint Foundation Support, to serve philanthropists by providing information on the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.         She was also a former trustee of the New York Civil Liberties Union, a former board member of the Citizens Committee for Children, a former chairwoman of Madison House, a former president of the New York Federation of Jewish Charities, a former board member of the Legal Defense Fund and a former member of the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary.         She was a donor of Adele Lehman Hall at Barnard College, named for her mother, and was a former trustee of Connecticut College and a former board member of the Columbia University School of Social Work and the Dalton School.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Frances L. Loeb of Manhattan; three sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, Peter, of Philadelphia, and Paul, of Boston; nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         A statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said Dr. White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother would often be healthy a month before delivery but would die if allowed to go to full term.

She also found that although infants of diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size despite premature birth they require the same special care needed for premature infants.

        Esther McCoy, an architectural historian and critic, died of emphysema on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 85 years old.         Esther McCoy, an architectural historian and critic, died of emphysema on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 85 years old.         A specialist in West Coast architecture, Ms. McCoy was the author of many books and hundreds of articles in leading architectural publications.         ''It was she, almost single-handedly, who awakened serious scholars to the extraordinary richness of California architecture,'' wrote Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for The New York Times, when a new edition of Ms. McCoy's 1960 work, ''Five California Architects,'' appeared in 1975. Her book, he added, was largely responsible for rescuing the five almost-forgotten architects - Bernard Maybeck, Irving Gill, R. M. Schindler and Charles and Henry Greene - from obscurity.         Calling Ms. McCoy ''the pre-eminent writer of California architecture,'' Cesar Pelli, a former dean of the Yale School of Architecture, told The Times in an interview five years ago, ''Our knowledge of Southern California architecture has been primarily formed by her research, her first-hand knowledge and her writing, which is so precise and passionate.''         She was born in Coffeyville, Kan., and was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. She began her career in New York writing architecture reviews for a number of publishers.         She worked as a draftsman in the Hollywood office of R. M. Schindler from 1944 to 1947 and began writing about the architects she had come to know. In 1985, she was given the American Institute of Architects' national honor award for excellence.         She is survived by a sister, Ruth Hahn of Denver, Colo., and a nephew, John McCoy of Shanghai.

Polly Cronyn Parrott, a former editor at The New York Herald Tribune died at her home in Plandome, L.I., on Thursday. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Parrott, a longtime resident of Plandome, graduated in 1931 from Cornell University and worked for 18 years as an editor on the society desk of the newspaper. She retired in 1950.         She was active in her community, serving on its election board, singing alto in the Port Washington Singers choir in Port Washington, L.I., and working as a Friend of the Library in Manhasset.         She is survived by her husband, Thomas; a son, John, of Brookfield, Wis.; a brother, Thomas Cronyn of Plandome; a sister, Nancy C. Knox of Darien, Conn., and one grandson.       
        Beatrice Rosenberg, a lawyer who held high positions in the Federal Government and argued more than 30 cases before the Supreme Court, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. She was 81 years old and had moved to Silver Spring from Washington two years ago.         Beatrice Rosenberg, a lawyer who held high positions in the Federal Government and argued more than 30 cases before the Supreme Court, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. She was 81 years old and had moved to Silver Spring from Washington two years ago.         Ms. Rosenberg headed the appellate litigation section of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when she retired in 1979. She joined the commission in 1972 after 29 years at the Justice Department, where she often appeared before the High Court as chief of the appellate section in the Criminal Division.         At the Justice Department, she helped draft a bill on crime for the District of Columbia known for its provisions for preventive detention and ''no knock'' searches.         Largely unknown outside Government circles, she was highly respected within them, and was reported to be under consideration for a Supreme Court nomination in the Nixon Administration.         In 1970 she was the first woman to receive the Tom C. Clark Award for outstanding government service by a lawyer. After retirement she became a volunteer mediator in a dispute resolution program in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and a member of a legal disciplinary board of the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals.         Ms. Rosenberg was born in Newark, where she was a high school classmate of William J. Brennan Jr., now a Supreme Court Justice. She was a graduate of Wellesley College and New York University Law School.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Albert A. Rosenberg of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.       
        May Swenson, a poet known for her cerebral, playful verse, and a recipient two years ago of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died yesterday in Ocean View, Del. She was 76 years old and had been suffering from chronic asthma.         May Swenson, a poet known for her cerebral, playful verse, and a recipient two years ago of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died yesterday in Ocean View, Del. She was 76 years old and had been suffering from chronic asthma.         Miss Swenson, who came to New York half a century ago from her birthplace, Logan, Utah, published her first collection of poems, ''Another Animal,'' in 1954. That book led the critic John Ciardi to declare: ''May Swenson is not a promise, but a fact. She has daring, a true feeling for the structure of the whole poem, precision of phrase, and a magic eye for the exact image.''         In all, Miss Swenson published nine volumes of poems, many of which first appeared in The New Yorker. Unlike many of her counterparts, she did not treat poetry as a tragic expression, a mode of despair. She was associated instead with a more joyful, clever, often lighthearted sensibility. In her poem ''Analysis of Baseball,'' she wrote:  It's done  on a diamond,  and for fun.  It's about  home, and it's  about run.         She transformed her daily experiences - a walk in fresh snow, a view of the surface of water, the observation of a bee sipping nectar from a yellow rose - into objects of art. She was able, as one critic wrote, to make her readers see what they had only glanced at before. 'A Dazzling Technician''         In 1979, when her collection ''New and Selected Things Taking Place'' was published, a reviewer in The New York Times spoke of Miss Swenson's ''refreshing delight in the metaphysically absurd.'' The poet and critic Anne Stevenson called Miss Swenson ''a dazzling technician and manifestly an intelligent and sympathetic woman.''         The idea of the 1979 volume was not so much to write poems but, in the words of the title, to describe ''things taking place.'' Miss Swenson concerned herself with the observations her eyes made, as in this line from a poem entitled ''Colors Without Objects'':  I wait for a few  iridium specks of idea to thrive  in the culture of my eye.         Reflecting poetically on the relationship between observation and intellect, vision and thought, Miss Swenson in 1963 closed a poem entitled ''Cabal'' this way:  Eye light and mind light,  lightning-taming leather  I will turn, and be  a swiftness on the dark.         Miss Swenson, who lived for the last two decades of her life with her companion, R. R. Knudson, in Sea Cliff, L.I., graduated from Utah State Agricultural College. She worked for a year on a Salt Lake City newspaper before coming to New York in the late 1930's. She worked for several years as a stenographer and then as an editor for New Directions, writing poems all the time.         With recognition came awards, including Rockefeller, Guggenheim, and Ford Foundation grants, the Brandeis University Creative Arts Award and, in 1981, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry from Yale University. Two years ago, she received a $130,000 Fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation.         Miss Swenson is survived by eight brothers and sisters, all of Utah.
