Miss Webster was named Gloria Caroline Gall when she was born, in New York City. She changed her name when she became an actress. For a decade, she appeared at clubs throughout the United States in a one-woman comedy act she had developed.         In 1968, Ms. Webster and two partners opened the Wright/Hepburn/ Webster Gallery in New York, which dealt exclusively in theatrical art and design. It mounted the first exhibition of contemporary Soviet theater, film, ballet and opera designs to be shown outside of the Soviet Union. The gallery later showed the work of a forger, David Stein, and was sued by the state's Attorney General to bar sales of his paintings, although the show was titled ''Forgeries by Stein.'' The New York State Supreme Court ruled in the gallery's favor.         After the gallery closed in 1973, Ms. Webster wrote a cookbook, ''Eating and Living the Transcendental Meditation Way,'' which was published by Simon & Schuster.         Survivors are her mother, Clarice Lee of La Jolla, Calif., and a sister, Lucille Driskell of Philadelphia.       
        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.

Hanson, a project director for AmeriCares, an international relief agency based in New Canaan, Conn., was killed on Monday along with her mother, Phoebe Dunn, a commercial photographer, and 19 other people in the crash of a Costa Rican airliner near San Jose, the capital city. She was 49 years old and lived in New Canaan.         Mrs. Hanson had managed airlifts of medical supplies to disaster areas including Quito, Ecuador; Kingston, Jamaica, and Yerevan in Soviet Armenia.         She was director of Christmas in April, one-day housing rehabilitation projects in 1988 and 1989 in a low-income area of South Norwalk, Conn., and had helped start similar projects in Virginia and South Carolina.         She was a graduate of Briarcliff College.         She is survived by her husband, Peter, and three daughters, Kate, of Brooklyn, and Molly and Emily, both of New Canaan.       
        Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago.         The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).         Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).         Some of Her Other Films         Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953).         The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000.         From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards.         The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907.         When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again.         Left School at Age 13         Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family.         At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' ''         In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.         Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra.         'Beloved by All' Involved         Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.''         Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston.         Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times.         Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice:         ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.''         Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom.         Praise for 'Thorn Birds'         In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.''         Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce:         ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.''         In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer.

She was 82 years old.  The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in more than 80 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but vulnerable mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).

And, in 1987, her colleagues and admirers added their tributes to her independent spirit and professionalism as she received the 15th annual life achievement award of the American Film Institute.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).

Doris Bernstein, a psychoanalyst and past president of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57 years old.         Dr. Bernstein wrote on the psychology of women's anxieties and was working on a collection of her articles. She was a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association.         Born in Pottstown, Pa., she attended Pennsylvania State University and received a master's degree from Yeshiva University. She did her psychoanalytical training at the Institute.         She is survived by a daughter, Susan, of Manhattan; her mother, Rae Leventhal, of Pottstown; a brother, Harris, of Cherry Hill, N.J., and a sister, Elizabeth Feifer, of Long Island.       
        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981.

        Henrietta Klein, a founder and officer of the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn, died of cancer Sunday at Kingsbrook's David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute. She was 85 years old and lived in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.         Henrietta Klein, a founder and officer of the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn, died of cancer Sunday at Kingsbrook's David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute. She was 85 years old and lived in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.         Miss Klein had been affiliated with the institution for 64 years, since it had been founded as the Jewish Sanitarium for Incurables. At her death she was secretary of Kingsbrook's board.         For many years Miss Klein raised money for Kingsbrook as president of the Miriam Klein Research Foundation, which was founded by her mother in memory of a sister.         Miss Klein was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Her mother, Sadie, was an actress in the Yiddish theater, and her father, Isadore, a play producer.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Margaret Kelly, the mother of the late Princess Grace of Monaco and the matriarch of the famed Kelly family of Philadelphia, died of pneumonia Saturday at a convalescent home here. She was 91 years old.         Margaret Kelly, the mother of the late Princess Grace of Monaco and the matriarch of the famed Kelly family of Philadelphia, died of pneumonia Saturday at a convalescent home here. She was 91 years old.         She had lived at the home, the Linwood Convalescent Center, since 1982, and had suffered several strokes in recent years.         Mrs. Kelly was the first director of women's athletics at the University of Pennsylvania, and had also worked as a model. She was known both for her own accomplishments and those of her husband and children, particularly her daughter, the actress Grace Kelly, who later married Prince Rainier of Monaco. Princess Grace died in an automobile accident in September 1982.         Mrs. Kelly's husband, John B. Kelly Sr., was an Olympic rowing champion who parlayed his skills as a bricklayer into a construction empire. He died in 1960.         Mrs. Kelly is survived by two daughters, Margaret R. Conlan of Philadelphia and Lizanne K. LeVine of Gladwyne, Pa.; 13 grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.

She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Julie V. Marsteller, dean of disabled students at Barnard College, died of complications resulting from muscular dystrophy yesterday at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dean Marsteller was discovered to have muscular dystropy at the age of 11. She graduated from Barnard College in 1969 and served as college archivist before becoming a dean in 1979.         She was the recipient of the 1980 Ruth Kurzon Group for Handicapped Children Humanitarian Award and the Handicapped Professional Woman of the Year Award from Pilot International, a women's service organization. In 1986 she was inducted into the National Hall of Fame for Persons With Disabilities and this year was selected to receive Barnard's Medal of Distinction.         She is survived by her mother, Gloria Marsteller of Palm Beach, Fla., and a sister, Elizabeth A. Gordon of San Francisco.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Antonetta Ferraro, the mother of Geraldine A.

Antonetta Ferraro, the mother of Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Representative and Vice-Presidential candidate, died of emphysema and heart disease on Friday at the home of her daughter in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Ferraro, who lived in Forest Hills near her daughter's home, was hospitalized in December but left to stay with her daughter's family for the Christmas holidays and remained there until her death.         She was born in Manhattan and attended public school until she was 12 years old, when she went to work as a crochet beader in a Lower East Side factory. She married Dominick Ferraro, who was born in Italy, and they operated a family restaurant and a five-and-ten-cent store.         Widowed in 1944, she went back to work in the garment industry to support her children. Her daughter recalled yesterday that her mother's earnings put her and her brother, Carl, through high school and college. The daughter, who is married to John A. Zaccaro, has said she kept her maiden name in honor of her mother's struggle to educate her children.         In addition to Geraldine and Carl Ferraro, Antonetta Ferraro is survived by six grandchildren.       
        Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Miss Simon's 10 travel works included the landmark - and best-selling - ''New York Places and Pleasures: An Uncommon Guidebook,'' which has undergone four revisions since 1959, and parallel studies of Mexico City, Paris, London and Rome. Among other guidebooks are ''Italy: The Places in Between'' (1970 and 1984), ''England's Green and Pleasant Land'' (1974), ''Fifth Avenue: A Very Social History'' (1978) and ''A Renaissance Tapestry: The Gonzaga of Mantua'' (1988).         Telling Her Own Story         Autobiographies by the soft-spoken, cosmopolitan writer are ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood'' (1982) and ''A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence'' (1986). Her brother, Michael Grobsmith, said yesterday that Miss Simon recently completed and sent to Harper & Row the manuscript of a third volume, tentatively titled ''Etchings on an Hour Glass,'' ranging from her college years through two marriages and career to her latest travels.         Sybil S. Steinberg described Miss Simon's travel books in ''Publishers Weekly'' as being ''in a class by themselves, distinctly personal guides of rare good taste and discernment.'' J. H. Plumb, in The New York Times Book Review, called her work ''incomparable'' in making ''one of the dullest forms of literature a brilliant work of art.''         Kate Simon, whose given name was Kaila Grobsmith, was born in a Warsaw ghetto on Dec. 5, 1912, came to this country with her family by steerage at the age of 4 and grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx. In ''Bronx Primitive,'' she recalled vividly and unsentimentally her early years, her father, a tyrannical shoemaker, and her mother, who believed deeply in learning and in earning her own living before she married.         Exploring Her Adolescence         In ''A Wider World,'' Miss Simon recounted her rebellious adolescence, which helped get her into the challenging James Monroe High School, where she excelled; becoming a live-in baby sitter for an eccentric, radical family, and tentative, humorous and grim aspects of youthful sexuality. Robert Pinskey, in The New York Times Book Review, lauded her ''clean and unpretentious prose style, her aristocratic disdain for cant and her frank worldiness.''         She earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter College, held various editorial posts, mostly rewriting, and reviewed books for The New Republic and The Nation until she began writing travel guides. She won awards from the National Book Critics Circle, the English Speaking Union and Hunter College, where, her brother said, she was to begin teaching a writing course today.         Asked in 1986 by ''Contemporary Authors'' to advise travelers on how best to enjoy a trip, she replied: ''Go slow. If you have the time for eight countries, take five. If you're rushed to take five, take three.'' She also suggested regular eavesdropping on conversations in cafes, buses and trains and emphasized, ''Walk slowly, look, listen, smell.''         She had been married to Dr. Stanley Goldman, who died in 1942. They had a daughter, Alexandra, who died in 1954. Miss Simon was also married to Robert Simon, a publisher, until their divorce in 1960.         Survivors, besides her brother, who is a public health officer for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, include nieces and a nephew.         A memorial service is to be scheduled soon in Manhattan.

She was 63 years old.  It was in December that Mrs. Spann was found to be suffering from the disease, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister, Ruth Stapleton, and her other brother, Billy.         Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in 1983.         Mrs. Spann was an avid motorcyclist and belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights Organization. In 1977 she collected letters sent by her mother from India, where Lillian Carter served in the Peace Corps, for a book, ''Away From Home: Letters to My Family.'' It was published by Simon & Schuster.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by her husband, Walter, and a son, William.

        Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         In her late teens, she took a leave from high school to dance with Isadora Duncan's troupe in Europe. In the 1920's, she had minor roles on Broadway in ''The Green Hat'' and ''Saturday's Children.''         She left acting to pursue a career in real estate and cultivate her native hamlet of Sneden's Landing in Orangetown, overlooking the Hudson River, as a community of artists, writers and actors. Mrs. Gugler was following in the steps of her mother, an artist, who acquired almost two dozen homes in the secluded hamlet around the turn of the century and sought out poets, actors and musicians as tenants.         Sneden's Landing eventually became a haven for artistic celebrities, including Noel Coward, Laurence Olivier, Ethel Barrymore, Katharine Cornell and E. B. White. Today, the actors Bill Murray and William Hurt own homes there, as does Mikhail Baryshnikov.         Mrs. Gugler's husband, the architect Eric Gugler, died in 1974. She is survived by a sister, Alexandra, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Leslee Reis, a restaurateur credited with bringing cosmopolitan dining to the Middle West, died of a heart attack on Sunday while on vacation in New Orleans. She was 47 years old and lived in Evanston, Ill.         Leslee Reis, a restaurateur credited with bringing cosmopolitan dining to the Middle West, died of a heart attack on Sunday while on vacation in New Orleans. She was 47 years old and lived in Evanston, Ill.         She suffered from diabetes and had recently developed kidney disease.         Ms. Reis was born in Chicago, grew up in Cincinnati and graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1964 with a degree in biochemistry. While doing graduate work at Harvard University, she fell into what would be her lifelong passion: imaginative, lusty French cooking. She apprenticed herself to Julia Child and washed dishes for Mrs. Child's cooking classes in the Boston area. Eventually, Ms. Reis studied cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris.         In 1966 she and her husband, Andrew Reis, moved to Evanston, where Ms. Reis began a catering business. Eleven years later she opened Cafe Provencale, a country-style French restaurant with a partner, Lizann Bradshaw. Ms. Reis's cooking, her vast knowledge and flamboyant way with fine food and wine, her independent spirit and her table-side comedienne appearances earned Cafe Provencale a devoted following in the Chicago suburb.         ''She was a jolly, lively, good person and a wonderful chef,'' Mrs. Child said yesterday. ''She showed the world that you didn't have to be a man to be a great cook, and she was so generous in advancing women in the restaurant business.''         Ms. Reis earned 11 Critics' Choice Awards from Chicago magazine. She was a founding member of both the American Institute of Wine and Food and the Chicago branch of Les Dames d'Escoffier, a culinary group. In 1987 she was included in the Who's Who of Cooking in America, compiled by Cook's Magazine. The following year Cafe Provencale was named the fifth best dining spot in America by the Zagat Survey.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Winthrop, of Novato, Calif., and Elliot, of Evanston, and her mother, Shirley Tauber of Bellbrook, Ohio.

Jeanne Taylor Block, owner of the Westhampton Greenery, a Long Island gift shop, who was active in civic affairs, died of cancer on Saturday at Southampton Hospital. She was 57 years old and lived in Westhampton Beach.         Ms. Block was founder and co-chairwoman in the late 1980's of the Suffolk Safe Homes Coalition, a group dedicated to fighting drug abuse, and she served on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Safe Home Advisory Board.         She was a founder of the Westhampton Cultural Consortium, which raised funds for cultural activities on eastern Long Island. In 1975 and 1976 she founded Options for Women, a support group for women returning to work. She was also the founder and former president of the East End chapter of the National Organization for Women.         Ms. Block was a graduate of Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Va., and received a master's degree from Long Island University's Southampton campus.         She is survived by her husband, Max; her mother, Agnes Grace Taylor of Gaithersburg, Md.; a brother, Bruce Taylor of Annapolis, Md.; a daughter, Lauren, of Manhattan, and a son, Jamie, of Westhampton Beach.       
        Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Miss Goddard, a Hollywood star of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, was also publicized for her friendships with many notable figures; her marriages to Charles Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque, and her glamorous life style.         The actress, a former fashion model and showgirl, made her first major screen appearance in 1936 as a waterfront waif befriended by a forsaken assembly-line worker (played by Chaplin) in ''Modern Times,'' the last silent comedy feature.         Hollywood quickly took notice, and Miss Goddard earned leading comedy roles as an adventuress in ''The Young in Heart,'' as a battling wife seeking a Reno divorce in ''The Women,'' and as Bob Hope's pert romantic foil in ''The Cat and the Canary'' and ''The Ghost Breakers.''         Other early roles included a put-upon laundress in Mr. Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' (1940); Fred Astaire's partner in ''Second Chorus'' (1941), in which she gamely struggled to keep up with him in the dance ''I Ain't Hep to That Step, But I'll Dig It,'' and a lusty Southern belle singing a suggestive sea chanty to a party of prudes in the 1942 adventure ''Reap the Wild Wind.''         Runner-Up for Scarlett         The last of these roles was a consolation prize for the major disappointment of her acting career: losing the coveted part of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh in the final round of the ''Gone With the Wind'' competition. At the time Miss Goddard said she ''cried her eyes out,'' but years later she said she recalled the episode as only ''like a game.''         Miss Goddard, an energetic and articulate woman, was a close friend of a wide range of artists, including the composer George Gershwin, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and the artist Andy Warhol. She was wealthy, both from her Hollywood salaries and her husbands, but in later years she sold many costly artworks at auction, including her collection of Impressionist art, which was sold in 1979 for $2.9 million.         At the time, she said her reason for selling was no secret. ''It's because I don't want the responsibility any longer for this movable feast,'' she said, explaining that she was tired of carting the art from Switzerland to California and New York when she changed residences. Coincidentally, more than 20 items in her extensive jewelry collection are being sold today as part of an auction at Sotheby's in New York.         Tributes for Giving and Acting         The actress was known for her philanthropies as well as her art and gems. In the last 12 years, she awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to 300 theater and film students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She had previously given the university the diaries, manuscripts and personal library of Remarque, who died in 1970. In a statement yesterday, John Brademas, the university's president, hailed the ''vision and continued generosity'' of ''this remarkable actress.''         Miss Goddard's acting also inspired tributes. The writer Robert Benchley praised her as ''a woman who could charm a rock,'' and Ray Milland, a frequent co-star, hailed her as ''the most honest actress I ever knew; she gave it all she had.''         A celebrated Goddard role was a witty social-climber in ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' directed in 1946 by Jean Renoir. She said she preferred such roles to ''sweet, boring'' parts and that moviegoers also favored ''adventuruous characters because 90 percent of the public is good.'' When an interviewer called her glamorous, she defined glamour as ''a spell of charm,'' adding: ''I don't want to be a phony. I want to be real.''         The actress could also be blunt. When several of her friends were accused of being Communists by members of Congress in 1947, she remarked, ''If anyone accuses me of being a Communist, I'll hit them with my diamond bracelets.''         Powers Model and Ziegfeld Girl         Paulette Goddard was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I., on June 3, 1911, according to major film refererence works. However, news agencies yesterday quoted municipal employees in Ronco as giving her birth year of record as 1905. Her parents separated in her childhood, and she later chose her mother's maiden name, Goddard.         She left school early and became a Powers model and then a Ziegfeld Girl. She was briefly married to Edgar W. James, a lumber industrialist, and soon sought fame in Hollywood. She played a series of chorus and other bit parts, joined the Hal Roach stock company and met Mr. Chaplin, from whom she became inseparable.         Miss Goddard's later film roles included ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940), ''Nothing But the Truth'' (1941), ''So Proudly We Hail'' (1943), ''Kitty'' (1946), ''Unconquered'' (1947) and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1949).         Her roles in the 1950's were disappointing, and, except for a 1964 Italian film, ''Time of Indifference,'' she lived in retirement with Mr. Remarque from the time of her marriage to the novelist in 1958 until his death. Her other marriges ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Katharine Balfour, an actress and writer, died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, at her home in Manhattan yesterday. She was 69 years old.         Katharine Balfour, an actress and writer, died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, at her home in Manhattan yesterday. She was 69 years old.         In 1947 Miss Balfour created the central role of Alma in the original production of Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' in Dallas and on tour. Her Off Broadway roles included Helen of Troy in ''Helen'' in 1964. Her film roles included Ryan O'Neal's elegantly cool mother in ''Love Story'' (1970) and appearances in ''America, America'' (1963), ''The Adventurers'' (1970) and ''Teachers'' (1984).         Among the magazines to which she contributed articles were Family Circle and Modern Woman. On radio, she interviewed noted personalities as host of a talk show, ''Views in Brief,'' which was broadcast on WEVD in New York from 1968 to 1985.         Miss Balfour was a native of Manhattan and a graduate of Morris High School in the Bronx. She modeled for magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar while studying at the Actors Studio.         Surviving is a daughter, Mary Sillman, and a brother, Samuel Balber, both of Manhattan.       
        Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, Miss Vaughan influenced countless other singers - including Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade and Rickie Lee Jones - and made hits of such songs as ''It's Magic,'' ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' and ''Broken-Hearted Melody.'' Her ornate renditions of ''Misty'' and ''Send In the Clowns'' were invariable show-stoppers at jazz festivals in recent years, including the JVC Jazz Festival in New York, at which she appeared almost yearly.         Her voice remained remarkably unravaged by time; in her mid-60's, a period when most singers' vocal powers have sharply diminished, she was still close to her peak. Though her speaking voice deepened and darkened in later years, her singing retained a youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre, and she could still project delicate but ringingly high coloratura passages.         Where more idiosyncratic jazz artists like Billie Holiday excelled at interpretation, Miss Vaughan was a contralto who gloried in displaying the distinctive instrumental qualities of a voice that had a comfortable three-octave range and was marked by a voluptuous, heavy vibrato. Known for her dazzling vocal leaps and swoops, she was equally adept at be-bop improvisation and singing theater songs with a symphony orchestra. Among the singers of her generation, only Ella Fitzgerald enjoyed comparable stature.         ''She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,'' the singer Mel Torme said yesterday. ''So much so that I used to call her the diva. At one point, I asked her why she had never opted for an operatic career. She got kind of huffy, and said, 'Do you mean jazz isn't legit?' She was very defensive about being a jazz singer. Where someone like Benny Goodman was able to split his musical image and record Mozart concerts, she wanted to perform precisely where she was.''         Appropriate Nicknames         Throughout her career, Miss Vaughan was affectionately known as Sassy or the Divine Sarah. The first nickname reflected her sense of humor and the mischievous sexiness that often inflected her singing and stage patter. The second, appropriated from the legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt, acknowledged her phenomenonally versatile voice. Foremost among the singers Miss Vaughan admired was the soprano Leontyne Price, to whom she bore more than a passing vocal resemblance.         John S. Wilson, in a New York Times review of a Vaughan performance in 1957, credited the singer with ''what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.''         When Miss Vaughan appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in 1974 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, Mr. Wilson commented on the ''soaring highs and incredibly full lows'' she displayed in her opening numbers and summed up the conclusion of her concert as ''totally virtuosic.''         Sarah Lois Vaughan was born in Newark, on March 27, 1924. Her father was a carpenter and amateur guitarist and her mother a laundress and church vocalist. She studied the piano from the age of 7 and later took up the organ, and at age 12 she became the organist at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, where she was also a soloist in the choir.         Career Began on a Dare         She also enjoyed performing popular tunes at parties, and when friends urged her to enter an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in New York, she took the dare and won first prize in October 1942, singing ''Body and Soul.'' The singer Billy Eckstine heard her perform, and six months after winning the contest she was hired at his recommendation as a second pianist and singer with Earl (Fatha) Hines's big band, in which Mr. Eckstine was a vocalist and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were instrumentalists.         The following year, when Mr. Eckstine formed his own band - which featured Mr. Parker, Mr. Gillespie, Art Blakey and Miles Davis, among other jazz greats - Miss Vaughan went along, and remained with him for a year. After a two-month stint in John Kirby's jazz group in the winter of 1945-46, she began a solo career. Her early solo recordings - on which she performed songs like ''Lover Man'' in full-blown be-bop style, accompanied by Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie -helped establish her reputation as a jazz singer.         First Husband Was Her Manager         During an extended engagement at Cafe Society Downtown in New York City, Miss Vaughan met George Treadwell, a trumpet player, whom she married. He became her manager, and under his guidance she made the transition from jazz cult figure to popular singing star.         She had her first hit in late 1947 with ''Tenderly,'' for the small Musicraft label. The following year, her version of ''It's Magic,'' a song from the movie ''Romance on the High Seas,'' established her as a full-fledged pop star. In 1949, she signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, where she remained until 1954, recording mostly popular songs backed by studio orchestras. Out of more than a dozen hits she had on Columbia, the most successful was ''These Things I Offer You,'' in 1951. Although most of her Columbia hits were disposable pop confections, she also recorded many lasting standards. Columbia recently reissued a collection of 28 songs she recorded between 1949 and 1953.         When Miss Vaughan moved to the Mercury label in 1954, she was given the freedom to pursue a dual career as both a popular and jazz singer. For EmArcy, Mercury's jazz subsidiary, she recorded with Clifford Brown, Cannonball Adderley and members of Count Basie's Orchestra, among other jazz artists. On the parent label, she also scored a steady succession of hits for the rest of the decade.         Songs of Seduction         Two of her biggest successes, ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' (1954) and ''Whatever Lola Wants'' (1955), from the Broadway musical ''Damn Yankees,'' were songs of seduction in which her almost overripe timbre gave an extra edge of sensuality to come-hither messages. Her two other biggest hits were the title song of the Broadway show ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956) and ''Broken-Hearted Melody'' (1959), a ballad with a light rock-and-roll beat. Her complete output for Mercury -263 cuts - was recently reissued.         After 1959, Miss Vaughan would never have any commercially significant pop hits. But over the next 30 years, her reputation as consummate vocal artist soared steadily, thanks to her appearances in nightclubs, at jazz festivals and increasingly with symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad.         During the 1960's, she recorded briefly with Roulette, then again with Mercury and Columbia, and in the 70's and early 80's she made albums for Mainstream and Pablo. It was for Pablo, run by the jazz producer Norman Granz, that she recorded the most critically acclaimed album of her career, ''How Long Has This Been Going On?'' in which she sang with a group that included Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown.         The singer's later recordings ranged from an album of Beatles tunes to a collection of Brazilian pop songs. On CBS's classical crossover recording of ''South Pacific,'' she sang the role of Bloody Mary, and on Quincy Jones's all-star pop-jazz album, ''Back on the Block,'' she and Ella Fitzgerald sang together on a version of Josef Zawinul's ''Birdland.'' In 1982 she won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, for her ''Gershwin Live!'' recording on CBS.         Two Perennial Offerings         Though Miss Vaughan's repertory during her 1980's appearances at the JVC Festival varied from year to year, two songs she would always perform were ''Misty,'' which she had first recorded in 1957 with Mr. Jones, and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which became her musical signature during the last decade of her life.         Living up to her Sassy sobriquet, the singer liked to perform ''Misty'' as a duet with herself, singing the first half in her regular voice, than dipping to the bottom of her contralto to do an amusing imitation of a seductive male lounge singer. ''Send In the Clowns,'' the song that usually closed her shows, became her ultimate vocal showpiece, a three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression. The performances invariably won standing ovations.         Mr. Jones, who first worked with Miss Vaughan in Paris in 1957 when they recorded the original vocal rendition of ''Misty,'' had recently signed her to record a Brazilian fusion album on his label, Qwest. ''Sarah was the most musical singer America has ever known,'' Mr. Jones said yesterday.         Miss Vaughan's marriage to Mr. Treadwell ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Clyde Atkins, a professional football player; Marshall Fisher, a Las Vegas restaurateur, and Waymon Reed, a trumpet player.         She is survived by her mother, Ada, and a daughter, Deborah Vaughan, who uses the first name Paris for her acting career. Both live in Los Angeles.         Miss Vaughan's body will be flown to Newark for a funeral service on Saturday at Mount Zion Baptist Church.

She was 55 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson.         Anne Rice Squiccimarro, a professor and an administrator of Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., died of breast cancer on Thursday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 55 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson.         Known professionally as Dr. Anne Rice, she was a professor in the department of natural sciences, coordinator for programs in the sciences, and was also dean of the College for Academic Advising, a division of Mercy College.         Mrs. Squiccimarro was born in Manhattan and graduated from Marymount College in 1957. She entered the Novitiate of the Sisters of Mercy in Tarrytown in 1952 and served as a sister for 19 years, teaching at parochial schools in Tarrytown and in the Bronx. She received a master's degree from Fordham University in 1962, and a Ph.D. from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1984. In 1981, she married Frank M. Squiccimarro.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a stepson, Frank M., of Hastings-on-Hudson; her mother, Bridget Rice of Hastings-on-Hudson, and two sisters, Elizabeth Bradley of Ramsey, N.J., and Margaret Dooley of Troy, Mich.       
        Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lady Keith, known to her friends as Slim, had just completed her memoirs, ''Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life,'' which is to be published later this year by Simon & Schuster.         Known for her wit and charm, she was a sought-after guest, a close friend of Ernest Hemingway, the Selznicks and much of Hollywood and New York society. Truman Capote, who called her ''Big Mama,'' was one of her closest friends until he wrote ''Answered Prayers,'' an article that caricatured New York society. After the article was published in Esquire she never spoke to Mr. Capote again.         In her later years her circle of friends included Mike Nichols and Jerome Robbins.         Married Hawks and Hayward         A native of Salinas, Calif., she acquired her title from her third husband, Lord Kenneth Keith, a British merchant banker, whom she married in 1962.         She was Mary Raye Gross at her birth on July 15, 1916, but her mother changed her name to Nancy. She grew up to be the kind of beauty that was sought after in Hollywood, although she never appeared in films. In her early 20's she became a regular guest at San Simeon, the Hearst estate, and in 1941 Gary Cooper gave her away when she married Howard Hawks, the director and producer. Their daughter, Kitty Hawks, survives her.         In 1946, 150 fashion editors and stylists named ''Slim'' Hawks the best-dressed woman of the year. The runner-up was the Duchess of Windsor. At the time, Mrs. Hawks was quoted as saying, ''I have a tall, skinny frame that clothes look well on. Seriously, just say that I'm a great believer in simplicity in clothes.''         In her Hollywood years she was credited with discovering and promoting such stars as Lauren Bacall, Joanne Dru and Ella Raines, all of whom resembled her somewhat in their casual, long-limbed type of good looks.         Two days after she and Mr. Hawks were divorced in 1949, she married Leland Hayward, the movie and theatrical producer, at the Manhasset, L.I., estate of William S. Paley. She and Mr. Hayward divorced in 1959 and three years later she married Kenneth Keith. They were divorced in 1972. ''I was married to each for about 10 years,'' she said at the time. ''I guess that's about all I can hack.''         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Theodora Andersen, of Burlingame, Calif., and four stepchildren, Alastaire Keith and Camilla Mackesson, the children of Lord Keith, and William Hayward and Brooke Hayward Duchin.

Richman, a lawyer who specialized in juvenile justice, died of cancer on Monday at her home in Short Hills, N.J. She was 55 years old.         Mrs. Richman began her legal career in the New Jersey Public Defender's Office in 1967 after graduating from Seton Hall Law School. She became head of the first statewide Juvenile Defender's Office in 1969 and helped draft the state's juvenile justice code in the early 1970's.         In 1977, she became assistant commissioner of the New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate and later supervised its juvenile program. Most recently she represented youngsters in child-abuse and child-advocacy cases.         She is survived by her husband, Stanley M. Richman; two daughters, Nancy, of Port Washington, L.I., and Deborah, of Morristown, N.J.; and her mother, Belle Rosenberg of South Orange, N.J.       
        Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Since Mrs. Hyde was found to have cancer five years ago, she worked ardently to call attention to the disease, raising nearly $2 million for Georgetown University Medical Center, which established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research last year.         In March she organized a benefit at the new Chanel boutique at the Willard Hotel in Washington for which 350 people paid $350 a ticket. The evening raised more than $50,000 for the Nina Hyde Center and an equal amount for Look Good . . . Feel Better, a separate counseling program that helps women after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.         As a reporter, Mrs. Hyde was known for covering fashion as intently as if she were covering a war, searching for the sociological significance of such trends as the development of the punk style in London.         Style of Protest Movement         Her article on that phenomenon helped draw attention at the end of the 1970's to the protest movement among the young. It also helped alert retailers to the London street scene.         She traveled through Europe and the Far East for exhaustive studies of the history of silk and of wool, with her analysis appearing in National Geographic. She was also noted for her ''Ins and Outs'' column on New Year's Day, which covered political and social trends as well as fashion.         She also conducted a lecture series at the Smithsonian Institution, with guests like the designers Issey Miyake, Norma Kamali and Sonia Rykiel.         But she was not averse to offering mundane, sensible advice to women on how to dress. Short skirts look younger than long ones, she believed. Classic shapes are good investments, she said. She advised her readers to buy clothes on sale and at discount. She herself usually wore black dresses and very little makeup.         The daughter of Dr. Harry A. Solomon, an internist, and his wife, Ruth, she was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College. One of two women accepted at the time for New York University's Law School, she dropped out to work for McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, and the Maidenform Brassiere Company. Later she joined Women's Wear Daily as the corset and brassiere editor. In 1961, after marrying Lloyd Hyde, a real estate developer, she moved to Washington where she wrote a column, ''Hyde & Chic,'' for The Washington Daily News. After that newspaper's demise she joined The Washington Post, in 1972.         Celebrities Honor Writer         In 1986, when the Fashion Group decided to honor her at a formal dinner raising money for the group's' scholarship fund, she insisted that some proceeds go toward AIDS research. More than 800 people paid $150 to attend, including fashion designers like Bill Blass, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren from New York, Carla Fendi and Rosita Missoni from Italy and Jacqueline de Ribes and Thierry Mugler from Paris.         Fashion designers have been major contributors to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Mr. Lauren was host at a cocktail party two years ago and donated $100,000 to get the fund started. Other supporters include Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix and Yves Saint Laurent and the Chanel company.         Mrs. Hyde received the Eugenia Sheppard Award for outstanding fashion reporting by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1988 and she was made a Chevalier des Artes et Lettres in Paris last October.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Washington, and Andrea, of San Francisco; her mother, Ruth Solomon of New York; a brother, Howard Solomon of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Marquise Sue de Brantes, of St. Armand Lepypre, France.         The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. Monday at the Washington Hebrew Congregation at Macomb Street and Massachusetts Avenue.

        Dovima, the model whom Richard Avedon called ''the most remarkable and unconventional beauty of her time,'' died of cancer on Thursday at her home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 63 years old.         Dovima, the model whom Richard Avedon called ''the most remarkable and unconventional beauty of her time,'' died of cancer on Thursday at her home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 63 years old.         Born Dorothy Virginia Margaret Juba in Jackson Heights, Queens, she constructed the name by which she was known from the initials of her given names. It was the name of an imaginary companion she invented as a child when she was bedridden with rheumatic fever.         Along with Lisa Fonssagrives, Sonny Harnett, Dorean Leigh, Suzy Parker and Jean Patchett, Dovima personified the haughty, regal look of the 1950's. She left modeling in 1962, at the age of 35, saying, ''I didn't want to wait until the camera turned cruel.'' She had several small roles in television plays before retiring in 1975.         ''She was the last of the great elegant, aristocratic beauties,'' said Mr. Avedon, who photographed them all. His picture of Dovima with elephants that appeared in Harper's Bazaar in 1955 is one of the most widely anthologized of all fashion photographs.         Like Mona Lisa         ''I never thought of myself as a beautiful woman,'' she told an interviewer four years ago. ''As a child, I was a gangly, skinny thing and I had this ugly front tooth that I broke when I was playing dress-up in my mother's clothes.''         She was walking out of an Automat in 1949 with her first husband, Jack Golden, when a woman asked her if she had ever been a fashion model. The woman said she worked for Vogue magazine and invited her to have some test photographs made. The next day she was photographed by Irving Penn. She kept her mouth closed because of her bad tooth and the photo had a mysterious look that reminded those who saw it of the Mona Lisa. Within a year she was one of the most popular models at the Ford Model Agency, where she made $30 an hour when the other leading models made $25.         ''I think she went up to $60,'' recalled Jerry Ford, who runs the agency with his wife, Eileen. ''She was the super-sophisticated model in a sophisticated time, definitely not the girl next door. After her came the young junior look from London with Jean Shrimpton, Twiggy and Penelope Tree, and fashion was off on another tack.''         She was married three times and had a daughter, Allison, with her second husband, Alan Murray. Her last husband, West Hollingsworth, a bartender, died in 1985.         In 1974 she moved to Fort Lauderdale to be near her parents, who had retired there. Her father, Stanley, had been a police officer in Manhattan. She worked at odd jobs, like selling cosmetics and serving as a hostess at the Two Guys Pizzeria in Fort Lauderdale.         ''They're nice people,'' she said of her employers there. ''They treat me well. I'm the mascot on their softball team.''         She is survived by her mother, Peggy Juba, and a brother, Stanley Juba, both of Fort Lauderdale.       
        Kezia Keeble, a former Vogue editor and a powerful public-relations executive who helped reshape the image of American fashion, died at her home in Manhattan on Friday night.         Kezia Keeble, a former Vogue editor and a powerful public-relations executive who helped reshape the image of American fashion, died at her home in Manhattan on Friday night.         She died of breast cancer after a five-year battle with the disease, her business partner, Paul Cavaco, said. She was 48 years old.         She was a founder and the president of Keeble Cavaco & Duka, a public relations and advertising company. The agency was recognized for its award-winning campaigns for Bergdorf Goodman, the specialty store, and in recent years the company helped bring several American fashion designers to prominence, including Stephen Sprouse, Bill Robinson, Charlotte Neuville and Gordon Henderson.         The agency now represents such designers as Gianni Versace, Ronaldus Shanask, Robert Lee Morris and Gordon Henderson. The agency will continue to operate under the direction of its remaining partners.         Youngest Vogue Editor         Ms. Keeble attended the Spence School and the Westover School and Briarcliff College. She began her career at Conde Nast publications in 1963 as a dress, suit and coat editor at Glamour magazine. When she went to work at Vogue under editor Diana Vreeland in 1966 at the age of 24, she was one of the youngest editors ever at the magazine.         She was later fashion editor at Esquire from 1976 to 1977.         In the early 1970's, after starting a successful jewelry company, she began work as a freelance fashion-photography stylist, helping to create the look and mood of photographs and television commercials. In 1976 she married Mr. Cavaco and formed a partnership, Keeble Cavaco Inc.         Ms. Keeble's early association with photographers like Bruce Weber and Steven Meisel resulted in innovative advertising campaigns for such clients as Christian Dior, Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein. Mr. Klein's controversial jeans commercials with Brooke Shields were among the campaigns.         After her divorce from Mr. Cavaco, in 1985, she married John Duka, a style reporter for The New York Times, and formed the present company, Keeble Cavaco & Duka. Mr. Duka died in 1989.         Fast-talking and irrepressibly enthusiastic, Ms. Keeble had reached the level in her business where she had become that rare public-relations executive who did not return journalists' phone calls.         Ms. Keeble is survived by her daughter, Cayli Cavaco of Manhattan; her mother, Barbara Mott of Bronxville, N.Y., and her sister, Lucy Keeble Wilkinson of Atlanta.         A memorial service is to be announced this week.

        Sayde Brenner Busch, who as Sayde Tisch was a member of the family that founded the chain that is now Loews Hotels, died yesterday at Victoria Hospital in Miami. She was 90 years old and lived in Bal Harbour, Fla. She had been in a coma for 10 days, the family said.         Sayde Brenner Busch, who as Sayde Tisch was a member of the family that founded the chain that is now Loews Hotels, died yesterday at Victoria Hospital in Miami. She was 90 years old and lived in Bal Harbour, Fla. She had been in a coma for 10 days, the family said.         In 1935, in the depths of the Depression, she and her husband, Al Tisch, established two boys' camps, Laurel and Lincoln, in the Poconos. Their teen-aged sons, Laurence and Preston, worked summers at the camps. In 1946, the father, then a clothing manufacturer, advanced money for the sons, fresh out of wartime service, to go into business for themselves.         They bought a resort hotel, Laurel-in-the-Pines, at Lakewood, N.J., where their mother became the hostess. It was the first of many hotels that the Tisch brothers acquired and that their mother helped to run.         President of Company         For many years she served as president of Tisch Hotels while the chain included the McAlpin in Manhattan and Traymore and Ambassador in Atlantic City. In Florida, she handled guest relations at the Americana at Bal Harbour when it was owned by her sons.         Laurence Tisch is now chairman of CBS as well as chairman of the Loews Corporation. Preston Robert Tisch, known as Bob, is chairman of the hotel chain and of the Lorillard Corporation and served as United States Postmaster General in the mid-1980's.         Al Tisch died in 1960. In 1969, Mrs. Tisch married S. Harry Busch.         She was an accomplished dancer and ice skater. Until her late 80's, she regularly swam up to two miles a day.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sons, who live in Manhattan, and by 7 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  June 21, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final         Because of a mechanical error, an obituary on Tuesday about Sadye Brenner Busch, a member of the family that owned what became the Loews Hotels chain, omitted information on survivors in some copies. Her first husband, Al Tisch, died in 1960.         In 1969 Mrs. Tisch married S. Harry         Busch, who survives.

        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.

Margaret Lockwood, an actress who became one of the most popular figures in British films of the late 1940's, died on Sunday. She was 73 years old.         Miss Lockwood's family would not disclose the cause of death.         She was born in Karachi, Pakistan, on Sept. 15, 1916, and sent to England to be educated. When she was 12 years old, she had her first stage role, as a fairy in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''         She was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and made her first film, ''The Amateur Gentleman,'' when she was 19.         Of Fright and Espionage         Miss Lockwood first came to prominence as the frightened heroine in Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film ''The Lady Vanishes,'' in which she played a young woman who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving an abduction.         Her other notable films include the 1940 ''Night Train,'' directed by Carol Reed, in which she co-starred with Rex Harrison in a tale of World War II espionage; ''The Stars Look Down'' (1941), another Reed film, about a catastrophe in an English mining town; ''The Man in Gray'' (1943), a Regency period melodrama, and the 1945 hit ''The Wicked Lady,'' another period piece in which she played an aristocrat who joins a highwayman (James Mason) in his life of crime.         In 2 TV Series         By 1957, she had acted in more than 40 films. Her last film appearance was in 1976, in a cameo role in ''The Slipper and the Rose.''         She was featured in the popular 1960's British television series ''The Flying Swan,'' co-starring her daughter, Julia Lockwood, and in a series called ''Justice'' in the 1970's.         Her father, a railway clerk in the British colonial service in India, had little contact with her. Her mother disapproved of her first love, Rupert Leon, a London commodities clerk, and they married in secret. They were divorced during World War II.         She is survived by her daughter.

Alison Joy Seetah Leggatt became an actress against the wishes of her well-to-do parents. Her mother refused ever to see her act, considering the stage unsuitable for a well-bred young woman.         Her performance in 1927 in ''The Fanatics'' by Miles Malleson established her as one of the most promising theatrical newcomers of her generation.         During the 1930's, she appeared in Noel Coward's ''Cavalcade,'' playing a honeymooning wife on the Titanic just before it struck the iceberg. She also acted in plays by Clifford Bax and J. B. Priestley.         After World War II, she was Lavinia in T. S. Eliot's ''Cocktail Party'' with Rex Harrison and Margaret Leighton, and Mrs. Guzzard in Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.'' She played the emotionally restrained landlady in ''Epitaph for George Dillon,'' by Mr. Osborne and Anthony Creighton, in London and New York. In the early 1960's she was Flora in Mr. Pinter's ''Slight Ache.''         Although her theater career ended in the late 1960's, she continued to appear on television and had movie roles in ''Far From the Madding Crowd,'' ''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.''       
        Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Houlton died of breast cancer, her family said.         At a Congressional reception in 1985, Mrs. Houlton, who wrote under her maiden name, Peggy Mann, was honored as one of the nation's foremost authors of books and articles about preventing drug abuse. Her ''Marijuana Alert'' (1985), about drug-abuse prevention for adults, was based on an article she wrote for the Reader's Digest in 1979.         Many of Mrs. Houlton's books were for teen-agers and younger children. These include ''Arrive Alive: How to Keep Drunk and Drugged Drivers Off the Road'' and ''Twelve Is Too Old,'' a novel about tobacco and marijuana.         Mrs. Houlton was born in Manhattan, and was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Her first novel for adults, ''A Room in Paris,'' which was published in 1955, is about the lives and loves of a young American art student in France.         A TV Special         Some of her other books include ''Golda,'' a biography of Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel; ''The Last Escape,'' about a woman's mission to smuggle Jews out of Nazi-occupied Europe into Palestine; ''My Dad Lives in a Downtown Hotel,'' and ''The Street of the Flower Boxes.'' ''The Street of the Flower Boxes'' inspired an NBC television special in the 1970's that won a Peabody Award and that inspired a movement for neighborhood beautification.         The National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth recently established the Peggy Mann Scholarship Award for Outstanding Youth Involved in Substance-Use Prevention. Beginning next year, annual $1,000 college scholarships are to be given to students from each of the 50 states, Guam and Puerto Rico who have made distinguished contributions to their community and school-based drug-prevention programs.         She is survived by her husband, William, and two daughters, Jenny and Betsy Houlton, all of New York City and Fair Harbor, L.I.; a brother, John Mann of Conesus, N.Y., and her mother, Edna Mann of New York City.         Funeral services are to be held today at 10:30 A.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.       
        Mary Abigail McCarthy, a professor at Yale University Law School who was highly visible in the political campaign waged by Eugene J.

Mary Abigail McCarthy, a professor at Yale University Law School who was highly visible in the political campaign waged by Eugene J. McCarthy, her father, in 1968, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 41 years old and lived in Branford.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her father said, adding that she had been under treatment for a year at Yale-New Haven Hospital.         Ms. McCarthy, who was born in Washington, graduated from Radcliffe College, attended the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and received her law degree from New York University. She began to teach at Yale in 1982 as a supervising attorney and lecturer in clinical studies after a brief period as a public defender in Washington.         A Legal Clinic         As co-director of the legal clinic, training students in the practice of law, she specialized in public-interest disputes, individual rights and immigration cases.         Ms. McCarthy was a product of the 1960's civil-rights and antiwar campaigns. Opposed to violence, she turned to politics when the marches on the Pentagon and elsewhere deteriorated into street clashes.         She skipped a semester in her sophomore year at Radcliffe in 1968 to enlist in the Presidential campaign of Mr. McCarthy. With her mother, Abigail, and other family members, she scoured campuses and the country for votes for the former Minnesota Democratic Senator.         Because of her academic record, she was nevertheless permitted to graduate with her class in 1969. She later did advanced legal studies at Georgetown Law School.         Beside her parents, Ms. McCarthy is survived by two sisters, Ellen, of Washington, and Margaret, of Boston, and a brother, Michael, of Seattle.

Pauline Lichtenstein, former director of research and planning at Hofstra University, died August 4 at home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.         Mrs. Lichtenstein died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She joined the staff at the university in 1966 as a research associate in the Center for the Study of Higher Education. She retired in 1986. Earlier in her career, she had been a statistical consultant, and a statistician with the Industrial Commodity Corporation in Manhattan.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Lichtenstein graduated with a bachelor of business administration degree cum laude, from the City College of New York. She also studied mathematical statistics at Columbia University. She received a master's degree in psychology from Hofstra in 1966.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Hyman Lichtenstein; two daughters, Carolyn and Diane; her mother; a sister, and two grandchildren.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.

A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''

        Pearl Bailey was remembered at her funeral today as an extraordinary entertainer and a woman who loved life and everyone she met.         Pearl Bailey was remembered at her funeral today as an extraordinary entertainer and a woman who loved life and everyone she met.         ''Pearl was love, pure and simple love,'' Cab Calloway said. ''I mean it from my heart and soul, that Pearl Bailey was something you'll never see again.'' Mr. Calloway, who was a pallbearer, co-starred with Miss Bailey in the all-black production of ''Hello, Dolly!,'' which brought her a Tony Award.         About 2,000 people filled the Deliverance Evangelistic Church while scores waited outside in cool, overcast weather. The singer was dressed in blue and adorned with a string of pearls. She had a red rose in her hand.         Flowers from Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were among those displayed in the church, but for the most part the mourners were friends, family and ordinary people.         Miss Bailey, who spent much of her childhood in Philadelphia, died here las Friday at the age of 72, apparently of a heart attack.         The funeral service consisted of hymns, poetry and fond recollections.         'Plain and Simple'         ''If you knew Miss Bailey, she would like it to be plain and simple, not a lot of fanfare,'' the Rev. Timothy Jones, assistant pastor at the church, told the gathering.         ''She loved everybody,'' said her husband of 38 years, jazz drummer Louis Bellson Jr. ''I have a feeling if she knew we were making all this fuss, she'd say, 'Louie, What are you doing?'         ''They will remember her as a great entertaineer. She was a person of love. She believed 'show business' was 'show love.' ''         Rabbi Harold S. White, a lecturer at Georgetown University where Miss Bailey earned a degree in theology, said she ''craved privacy with her beloved Louie.''         ''She said of herself, 'What you see is what you get,' '' he continued. ''She chided name-droppers.''         After the service, Miss Bailey was buried at Rolling Green Memorial Park in nearby West Chester, where her mother and brother are buried.         Miss Bailey, who lived in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., collapsed in her hotel room, where she was recovering from knee surgery. Doctors said the surgery apparently was not a factor.

Mary Papajohn Haris, vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her son Konstantine said.         Mrs. Haris joined the Advertising Bureau in 1986 and was responsible for its national travel, tobacco and political advertising accounts. Before that, she was vice president of the American Standards Testing Bureau and from 1969 to 1984 directed marketing strategies for the MRC Television Network's teleconference system.         She was a graduate of Marymount Manhattan College and Columbia University.         She is survived by two sons, Konstantine and Alexander, as well as her mother, Alice Papajohn.

Lillian Pickard, a theater and television press agent, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. She was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died as a result of internal bleeding, said a friend and colleague, Sheldon Roskin.         Ms. Pickard began her career as a press agent in the mid-1940's and joined the firm of Salters, Roskin & Friedman in 1957. Among her accounts were the Barbra Streisand television specials, the Tournament of Roses Parade, the Bob Hope Chrysler Theater and ''Empire,'' a weekly television series starring Richard Egan. In 1987, she was injured in a car accident, which left her unable to work.         She is survived by her mother, Frieda Pickard of Yonkers, and two daughters, Beth and Jamie Kushnick, of Manhattan.

Lucy Goldschmidt Moses, a philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 103 years old.         Mrs. Moses's philanthropic interests largely reflected the activities of her husband, Henry L. Moses, whom she married in 1914. A lawyer and financier, he was president of Montefiore Hospital for many years. After his death in 1961 she established the Henry L. Moses Research Institute at the hospital.         Mrs. Moses was born in New York. As a child she was accompanied by a governess when she went skating in Central Park or took walks. Later, as a young woman beginning a 40-year career as a volunteer in settlement-house work, she cared for the children of poor families.         Center at Mt. Sinai         Beginning in the 20's, she also worked as a volunteer at Montefiore, first in the wards and later in the epilepsy clinic.         She donated tens of millions of dollars to philanthropy, a major part going to the medical field. In addition to gifts to Montefiore, she established the Lucy G. Moses Cardiothoracic Center, an advanced research and training institution, at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, She also contributed to health programs in Burma, Israel and South Korea. After her husband's death, she became president of the Henry and Lucy Moses Fund, which the couple established in 1942 to support education, music and the arts.         Mrs. Moses contributed for projects like the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and providing a wheelchair lift and other equipment for the handicapped at Carnegie Hall. She donated to New York University for studies in Egyptian art. Columbia University also received gifts for its housing program and a study hall in the Law School.         Mrs. Moses was a leading supporter of the opera and Lincoln Center. In 1983 she received the first Frederick Law Olmstead award for helping to restore the Bow Bridge over the Central Park Lake. ''They called me the Florence Nightingale of the trees,'' Mrs. Moses said at the time. ''I've also been called Mother of the Park. I've had such fun.''         Surviving are a daughter, Nancy Osserman of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and six grandchildren.         A service will be held on Monday at 2 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue and 65th Street.       
        Dr. Jane Cary Peck, an educator, author and a vice president of the National Council of Churches, died Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 58 years old and lived in Williamstown, Mass.         A spokesman for the Andover Newton Theological School, where she was a professor of religion, said she had died of cancer.         Dr. Peck was a graduate of Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., and earned her doctorate in social ethics at Boston University. She served on the governing board of the National Council of Churches for the past 12 years as a representative of the United Methodist Church. She participated in international conferences on ecumenical efforts for peace, justice and women's issues. In 1984, Westminster Press published her book ''Self and Family.''         This year, she traveled to Nicaragua for research for the World Council of Churches' study of ''Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation.''         She is survived by her husband, Robert; three sons, Robert of Seattle, James of Wellesley, Mass., and Jonathan of Williamstown; a daughter, Cary, of Williamstown; her mother, Ruth M. Chapman of Forsyth, Ga., and a sister, Ruth W. Hassler of Steinhatchee, Fla.

        Irene Dunne had a ladylike gentility that made her naughty antics in sophisticated comedies all the more hilarious. In classic farces like ''The Awful Truth,'' in which she portrayed a worldly divorcee briefly inpersonating a gauche chorine, she delighted audiences and reviewers with her wit and elan.         Critics agreed that her artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. Miss Dunne was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and longtime popularity, an Oscar eluded her.         Colleagues regarded her as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., once a co-star, wrote that she was ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         Studied Music         Of Irish descent, Irene Dunne was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec 20. The year was 1904, according to most sources. Her father was a supervisory steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, an accomplished pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended a convent school, studied voice and piano with private teachers, sang in a church choir, attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and, after winning an arduous contest, was given a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors.         After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected for being, Miss Dunne recalled, ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in a number of minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, a milestone year, she was cast in the leading role of Magnolia for what became a hugely successful 72-week tour of Florenz Ziegfeld's production of ''Show Boat.''         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after a minor picture called ''Leathernecking'' and six months of drama lessons, she won the leading role of Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.''         Miss Dunne was cast for several years in such tragic and lachrymose roles as a hanidcapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a hugely popular tearjerker; a troubled wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she challenged a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 30's         By the mid-30's, her rich, warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline,'' the sparkling ''Roberta,'' ''Show Boat,'' and ''High, Wide and Handsome.''         Miss Dunne chose her vehicles with great care and won even greater popularity in effervescent and urbane madcap comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a daring book and tries to live up to it.In several other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying backtalk.         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her personal favorite of her 41 films.         The actress later received accolades for two major wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was the indestructible Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's King in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family in early 20th-century San Francisco in ''I Remember Mama.''         Active in Philanthropies         Miss Dunne was miscast in her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by the makeup she wore to play a frumpy elderly Queen Victoria. Her final film was ''It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952. In the 50's, she made occasional television appearances.         As her acting career became less demanding, Miss Dunne found other pursuits, away from the film industry. An active Republican, she was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairman of many philanthropies.         Miss Dunne was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter, Mary Frances.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria.

        Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Mrs. Sigmund first learned that she had cancer in 1982, when a melanoma was found behind her left eye. The eye was removed and she continued with her political career.         But last year, after Mrs. Sigmund unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, doctors found that the cancer had spread. Mrs. Sigmund had finished second in the primary to Representative Jim Florio, who went on to win the general election.         Born in New Orleans         Politics and public service were a way of life for Barbara Boggs Sigmund. She was born on May 27, 1939, in New Orleans about the time that her father, Hale Boggs, was beginning his first term as a Democratic Congressman.         In 1972, the plane carrying her father, then the House majority leader, was lost over Alaska, and her mother, Corinne Lindy Claiborne Boggs, succeeded him in Congress.         Mrs. Sigmund's mother's family, the Claibornes, traced its roots to colonial Jamestown in Virginia and is said to have included more members of Congress than any other American family.         Politics 'All Around Us'         ''Nobody speechified about it,'' Mrs. Sigmund once said about the family's deep interest in politics. ''It was all around us.''         Her brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, is a prominent lawyer in Washington, and her sister, Cokie Roberts of Bethesda, Md., is a correspondent for National Public Radio and for ABC News on television and radio.         Mrs. Sigmund was a graduate of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. She married Paul E. Sigmund, a professor of political science at Princeton, in 1964. She became a Latin teacher at the Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Princeton. After the birth of the couple's three sons, she returned to the school to teach religion and government.         In 1974, she left Stuart to join the staff of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University.         After serving as a member of the Princeton Borough Council, she was elected in 1976 to the Mercer County Board of Freeholders. She was president of the board in 1979 and 1980.         In 1982, she decided to run for Congress, hoping she could join her mother on Capitol Hill. But at the last minute she changed her mind and ran instead for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, finishing fourth in a field of 10 candidates. It was during the 1982 campaign that she lost her eye to cancer and surprised everyone by showing up at a fund-raising event hours after checking out of the hospital. She was wearing an eye patch covered with the words ''Vote Sigmund.''         'Subject to the Fates'         After her defeat in the Senate primary, she was elected mayor of Princeton in 1983. ''There's no way to plan a political life,'' she said at the time. ''It's all subject to the fates. I enjoy practicing the craft of government and I think it can be done from the local level up, as well as the other way.''         She brought a ready wit and seemingly boundless energy to the job of Mayor and attacked the problems of providing affordable housing and managing development. She loved to point out that Princeton's image as a wealthy town was misleading. ''It has been a town of mixed-income groups and races for centuries,'' she said.         Once, she complained wryly that most of the town's newer residents were executives in the high-tech industries that were moving to Princeton and surrounding areas. ''We want a certain amount,'' she said, ''but not so much as to destroy the town.''         Writing Poetry         After Mrs. Sigmund was found to have a recurrence of cancer last year, she began chemotherapy treatments but continued to devote as much energy as she could to the duties of her office and her favorite hobby, writing poetry.         Her mother announced in July that she would not run for re-election to Congress. She did not say so at the time, but close associates said she wanted more time to spend with her daughter.         Besides her husband, her mother, her brother and her sister, Mrs. Sigmund is survived by three sons, Paul Jr., of Ann Arbor, Mich., David, of Detroit, and Stephen, of New Orleans.         A funeral service will be held on Saturday at 5:30 P.M. in the Princeton University Chapel.       
        Dorothy Perkins Freeman, who in 1960 donated her family estate in the Riverdale section of the Bronx to New York City to establish the Wave Hill arboretum and cultural center, died on Sunday at Miles Memorial Hospital in Damariscotta, Me. She was 99 years old and lived in Damariscotta.         Dorothy Perkins Freeman, who in 1960 donated her family estate in the Riverdale section of the Bronx to New York City to establish the Wave Hill arboretum and cultural center, died on Sunday at Miles Memorial Hospital in Damariscotta, Me. She was 99 years old and lived in Damariscotta.         Mrs. Freeman was born in Chicago, the daughter of George W. Perkins, a financier and partner in J. P. Morgan & Company. Her family moved to Manhattan in 1893, when she was 2 years old, and a decade later her father acquired the fieldstone house and grounds, known as Wave Hill, overlooking the Hudson River.         The house, built in 1830, had been occupied at various times by, among others, Theodore Roosevelt in his boyhood, Mark Twain and Arturo Toscanini. A second residence on the 20-acre estate, the red brick Perkins House, was built in the mid-1920's.         Mrs. Freeman and her husband, Edward Woolsey Freeman, moved into Wave Hill in the early 1930's. Three decades later, at the suggestion of Robert Moses, then New York City Parks Commissioner, the Freemans, joined by other heirs of Mrs. Freeman's mother, Evalina Ball, gave the estate to the city.         In 1962 the Freemans moved to Damariscotta, where they had established a second home in the 1920's. Mr. Freeman died in 1979.         Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Evelyn Scott of Montreal; two sons, George, of Holicong, Pa., and John, of Riverdale; 11 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.       
        Teresa De Francisci, who was the model for Miss Liberty on the Peace Dollar of 1921, died Saturday morning at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Teresa De Francisci, who was the model for Miss Liberty on the Peace Dollar of 1921, died Saturday morning at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure following surgery, her daughter said.         Mrs. De Francisci's stylized portrait as Miss Liberty appeared on the silver dollar issued to mark the return of peace at the end of World War I. It was the work of her husband, Anthony, a sculptor and the creator of many medals, including the inaugural medal for the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York.         On the 50th anniversary of the Peace Dollar, Mrs. De Francisci was honored by numismatists with a plaque inscribed, ''To a Lady of Peace.'' Now a collector's item, the Peace Dollar was issued from 1921 through 1928 and again in 1934 and 1935 before being discontinued.         'Wasn't a Portrait of Me at All'         ''I was just an accessory,'' Mrs. De Francisci was quoted as saying on the 60th anniversary of the coin. ''And really, my husband wasn't making a portrait of me. He wanted to make an idealized portrait of what freedom represented to him, so it really wasn't a portrait of me at all.''         Teresa De Francisci, whose maiden name was Cafarelli, was born in a town south of Naples. At 4 years old, she sailed to this country with her mother in steerage class. She grew up in Clinton, Mass., where her father had a grocery store. Her family recalls with pride that she was the first Italian-American to graduate from the local high school.         At 22, she married Mr. De Francisci, also an Italian immigrant. The New York sculptor was beginning to be known as a medalist, having designed another commemorative coin: the 1920 half dollar marking the centennial of Maine's statehood.         The De Franciscis never saved a 1921 Peace Dollar, which later acquired considerable value. ''Anthony was content to do the creating and let others do the collecting,'' his wife once said.         She is survived by one daughter, Gilda Slate of Manhattan.

         Claudia Stern, a writer and editor, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         Ms. Stern was a story editor and assistant producer for Edgar Sherrick and Sue Pollack, Manhattan film and television producers, from 1978 to 1980.         She collaborated with Charlotte Ford on "Modern Manners," published in 1980 by Simon & Shuster. She also worked with Ms. Ford and her sister Anne on "How to Love the Car in Your Life" (Ford Motor Company, 1972).         She is survived by her mother, Elsie Stern of Manhattan; a daughter, Abigail Rebecca Sims, also of Manhattan; and a brother, John Stern of Cape Neddick, Me.         Her companion was Bennett Byron Sims.       
         Eve Arden, the caustic comedienne featured in dozens of films as a heroine's wry and wisecracking best friend, a warmhearted but sassy schoolteacher or secretary, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The actress said she was born on April 30, 1912, but Ron Lisell, a spokesman for the family, said she was 83. Her death was caused by heart disease, Mr. Lisell said.         Miss Arden made her Broadway debut in the "Ziegfeld Follies" of 1934, but although she often appeared in plays in New York and on the road, she was chiefly a Hollywood actress. She was best known as the sardonic but likable English teacher in the radio and television series "Our Miss Brooks," which ran from 1948 until 1957. The series earned her an Emmy award as best actress for 1953.         The tall and languid Miss Brooks, noted for her exquisite comic timing and a knack for making the most of a throwaway line, received featured billing in more than 100 movies, including "Stage Door," "The Marx Brothers at the Circus," "No, No, Nanette," "Bedtime Story," "Cover Girl," "Anatomy of a Murder" and "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs." In 1945 she received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her performance in "Mildred Pierce."         The actress, whose original name was Eunice Quedens, was born in Mill Valley, Calif., near San Francisco. She was reared by her divorced mother and an aunt. Both encouraged her to act in school plays. At 16, she said, "I was dumped by my mother and aunt at the Henry Duffy office in San Francisco and told to get a job acting, which I did."         She joined the Duffy stock company, which performed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and she later switched to the Bandbox Repertory Theater, which toured the "citrus circuit" in Southern California.         Miss Arden was a seasoned 21-year-old actress when she got a job in "Low and Behold," a forerunner of the "New Faces" revues produced by Leonard Sillman. The producer Lee Shubert saw a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse and offered Miss Arden a part as a showgirl in the 1934 "Ziegfeld Follies" on Broadway. And he told her to shed her real name.         Eunice Quedens did so by studying the labels of cosmetic jars on her dressing table and, she said, "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden."         Eve Arden won her first theatrical accolade in 1935 when she was featured with Jimmy Savo in "Parade."The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: "Count on the credit side Eve Arden's lorgnette humor which turns a song entitled 'Send for the Militia' into highly amusing satire." That and other reviews helped to win Miss Arden a featured role in the 1936 "Ziegfeld Follies." As Fannie Brice's understudy, she starred in several performances. Success, With the Help of a Cat         Miss Arden made her film debut in a 1937 grade-B melodrama called "Oh, Doctor," in which she disastrously played a gun moll. But her big break came that same year when the director Gregory La Cava cast her in what was to have been a small role in "Stage Door," starring Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers.         The actress built up her supposedly minor role with the aid of a slothful cat named Henry, which hung around the set. Having noticed that the sluggish Henry hardly ever moved, Miss Arden called Mr. La Cava's attention to the fact that the cat liked to sleep draped over her shoulders. The director was amused, and he included many shots of Miss Arden wearing the live cat as a fur piece. She was long remembered as the "girl with the cat."         In three years Miss Arden appeared in more than 20 films, becoming typecast in roles characterized by brittle, caustic humor. Trying to get away from that stereotype, she returned to Broadway and won praise for her featured roles in the Kern-Hammerstein musical "Very Warm for May" in 1939, the revue "Two for the Show" in 1940 and Cole Porter's "Let's Face It" in 1941, in which she appeared with Danny Kaye.         Miss Arden nearly stole the 1944 war movie "The Doughgirls" from three stars by enlivening her role as a tough-talking Russian guerrilla, punctuating her flines in ractured English lines with funny and risque gestures with her sniper's rifle.         Other featured roles followed, most of them putting Miss Arden back in what she considered the rut of the coldly tart-tongued and vitriolic cynic. It mattered not, she said, that audiences always responded to her with laughter; she did not like seeing herself in those roles, which were carried over into radio shows in which she starred with Jack Haley and Jack Carson.         "I just don't like that dame," she said in 1952. "She is hard-boiled, unsentimental and not me."         With "Our Miss Brooks," Miss Arden was able to alter her image, keeping the snappy, sardonic lines but giving the schoolteacher character a warmly affectionate and self-deprecating side.         That television series went off the air in 1957, and Miss Arden appeared in only an occasional film until 1967, when she began a two-season run co- starring with the comedienne Kaye Ballard in the NBC television show "The Mothers-in-Law." She also appeared as a school principal in the films "Grease" in 1978 and "Grease II" in 1982, and in "Under the Rainbow" in 1981.         Miss Arden's second husband, Brooks West, an actor, died in 1984.         Survivors include two daughters, Liza and Constance, and two sons, Douglas and Duncan.         Correction:  November 17, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress Eve Arden misstated the date of her film debut. It was in 1929, when she appeared under her original name, Eunice Quedens, in "The Song of Love"; it was not in 1937.       
         Carrol Joy, an educator and author, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 52 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of a brain tumor, said her brother, Skip Federber, of Los Angeles.         Dr. Joy, who had a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley, wrote books about ways to attack world hunger and was a consultant to CARE and other humanitarian organizations. She had been on the faculty of St. Mary's College in San Francisco and also wrote books on developmental education, including "Believing Is Seeing," published by the American Forum for Global Education.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, Scott Grabo of Arlington, Va., and a daughter, Carrie Grabo of Woodbury, Vt.; her mother, Pearle Carroll of Las Vegas, and two grandchildren.       
         Mae D. Silbergeld, a technical manager for contractors in the space program, died last Thursday at Bethesda Naval Hospital. She was 66 years old and lived in Garrett Park, Md.         She died of cardiac arrest, her family said.         Ms. Silbergeld was with the ST Systems Corporation since 1983 and before that with Computer Sciences Corporation for 13 years, managing work under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.         She was a graduate of the University of Dayton and received a master's degree from the University of Illinois. She taught physics at Illinois and at North Carolina State University and did research at Stanford University and with the United States Public Health Service.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Sam Silbergeld; three daughters, Sandra, of Rockville, Md., Dr. Janet Silbergeld and Dr. Nancy Jecker, both of Seattle; a son, Dr. Danie Silbergeld, of Seattle; her mother, Jennie Driscoll, of Beavercreek, Ohio; two sisters, Ruth Hallman, of Beavercreek and Julie Stockman, of Dayton, Ohio; two brothers, Dr. Glenn Driscoll, of Fresno, Calif., and Carl Driscoll, of Lathrup Village, Mich., and two grandchildren.       
         Valerie French, who began her career as a much-publicized starlet for Columbia Pictures and became a screen, stage and television actress who specialized in playing a diverse collection of English characters, died Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59 years old.         She died of leukemia, said a friend, Tom Seligson, a television producer.         Miss French was born in London and spent her early childhood in Spain, returning to England to attend Malvern Girls' College in Worcestershire and then join the BBC drama department.         After several years in television production, she joined the Theater Royal Repertory Company in Windsor, where she played small parts.         After a screen test and a role in the film "The Constant Husband" in 1955, she went to Hollywood and became a contract actress with Columbia Pictures. She starred opposite Glenn Ford and Rod Steiger in "Jubal" (1956) and with Lee J. Cobb in "The Garment Jungle" (1957).         A Minor Sensation         On Broadway she acted in "Inadmissible Evidence" (1965) and "Help Stamp Out Marriage!" (1966). In "The Mother Lover," at the Booth Theater in 1969, she caused something of a sensation by appearing onstage nude with her back to the audience.         Miss French starred Off Broadway in Harold Pinter's "Tea Party" and "The Basement" in 1968, in a 1980 revival of Noel Coward's "Fallen Angels," and as the mother, Helen, in a production of "A Taste of Honey" in 1981.         Her television credits include roles in "Have Gun, Will Travel," "The Prisoner," "The Nurses," "Edge of Night" and "Brighter Day."         Miss French was twice married and twice divorced. In a 1981 interview she said that she and her second husband, the actor Thayer David, had been planning to remarry when he died in 1978.         There are no immediate survivors, Mr. Seligson said.       
         Jo-Ann M. Cox, a partner in the New York accounting firm Ernst & Young, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 45 years old and also lived in Sea Bright, N.J.         Ms. Cox died of cancer, a sister, Cynthia Schmidl, said.         Ms. Cox was born in Newark and raised in Union, N.J., where she attended grammar and high schools. She received a bachelor's degree in accounting at Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1967 and later earned a master's degree in international finance from Pace University.         She joined Ernst & Young about 20 years ago and spent her entire career with the company, specializing in auditing. She became a partner in 1985. Ms. Cox was also a director of Inwood House, a home for unwed mothers in New York City.         Ms. Cox is survived by her mother, Olga Wagner, of Union, and two sisters, Sonia Wagner, of Brigantine, N.J., and Mrs. Schmidl, of Middletown, N.J.       
         Vijay Lakshmi Pandit, an Indian independence fighter, diplomat and politician, and the first woman to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly, died today in the northern town of Dehra Dun. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Pandit, the sister of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the virtual chief of one of Asia's most important political dynasties, which included Mr. Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister for 13 years, and Mrs. Gandhi's son Rajiv, who succeeded his mother in 1984 and served until 1989.         President Ramaswami Venkataraman described Mrs. Pandit today as a "luminous strand in the tapestry of India's freedom struggle." "Distinctive in her elegance, courage and dedication, Mrs. Pandit was an asset to the national movement," he continued.         Frail with age and ailing for some time, Mrs. Pandit had not been poltically active for several years. She moved from New Delhi to Dehra Dun in 1970. But in 1977, outraged by the authoritarian state of emergency imposed from 1975 to 1977 by Indira Gandhi, she campaigned actively against her niece. A popular revolt led to electoral defeat for Mrs. Gandhi, who reportedly never forgave her aunt for her outspoken role.  Ambassador to Moscow         Mrs. Gandhi and Mrs. Pandit were also cool to each other because of what Mrs. Gandhi viewed as her aunt's condescension toward her mother. Kamala Nehru, Mrs. Gandhi's mother, came from a middle-class Kashmiri Brahmin family and married into the rich, aristocratic Nehru family. Accounts of the time say that she never quite adjusted to the change in lifestyle and was often lonely.         Mrs. Pandit, whose husband died in the 1940's, took part in the Indian freedom movement and was arrested several times by the British colonial authorities.         Her brother appointed her as Ambassador to Moscow when India became independent in 1947. She then held a succession of high positions, including ambassadorships to the United States and Britain and, in 1953, presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. She also led the Indian mission to the United Nations.         At home, she was elected a lawmaker two times and served as Governor of the western state of Maharashtra. She retired from public life in 1970 but later served as the Indian representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         She is survived by three daughters, including the novelist Nayantara Sehgal.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.         Miss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in "Bulldog Drummond" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in "Disraeli" (1929) and John Barrymore in "Moby Dick" (1930).         She portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in "Me and My Gal" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in "Little Women" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in "Private Worlds" (1935).         The leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made "Algiers," a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called "Trade Winds," and she began an entirely new career.         A Change of Personality         Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- "The House Across the Bay" and "The Man I Married" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in "Man Hunt" (1941), a mysterious model in "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in "Scarlet Street" (1946).         She also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's "Macomber Affair" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's "Woman on the Beach" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's "Reckless Moment" (1949).         Then, easily shifting images again, she was an elegant, witty and nurturing mother in two classic film comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli: "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951), co-starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.         Later in 1951, Miss Bennett was a principal in a major Hollywood scandal. Mr. Wanger shot and wounded her longtime agent, Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot, accusing him of being a home wrecker. Miss Bennett later attributed her husband's outburst to desperation over large financial losses.         To avoid further notoriety, Mr. Wanger pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served 100 days at a minimum-security prison farm. Mr. Lang soon recovered, but Miss Bennett's film career did not. Before the shooting, she had starred in more than 60 movies. After it, at the age of 41, she was offered only a handful of roles.         Bad Timing         In a 1981 interview, she contrasted the judgmental 1950's with the sensation-crazed 70's and 80's. "It would never happen that way today," she said, laughing. "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures."         The Wangers divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage.         As movie offers dwindled, Miss Bennett turned to the stage and made successful national tours in such plays as "Susan and God," "Bell, Book and Candle," "Once More With Feeling," "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Never Too Late."         She also lent her presence and prestige to television's top gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," which ran from 1966 to 1971 and attracted a major cult following. The series, which also dealt with a guilt-ridden vampire (Jonathan Frid), has been frequently rebroadcast.         Associates invariably applauded Miss Bennett for professionalism and dedication. In her 1970 autobiography, "The Bennett Playbill," written with Lois Kibbee, she said her experience with "Dark Shadows," in which she played the mistress of a haunted mansion, had given her new regard for daytime television performers.         Miss Bennett was celebrated for not taking herself too seriously. In 1986, she remarked, "I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much."         Theatrical Lineage         Joan Bennett was born on Feb. 27, 1910, in Palisades, N.J. Her parents were Richard Bennett, a flamboyant matinee idol, and Adrienne Morrison, an actress whose lineage went back five generations to strolling players in 18th-century England. The couple's elder daughters, Constance and Barbara, also became actresses.         Miss Bennett attended St. Margaret's, a boarding school in Waterbury, Conn., and L'Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France. At the age of 16, she married John Marion Fox, whom she later described as a playboy and drunkard. At 17, she had a daughter, Diana, and at 18, she divorced Mr. Fox.         That same year, her father got her the ingenue role in a Broadway melodrama, "Jarnegan," in which he starred as a lecherous, brawling movie director. She received good notices, and after a five-month run, he helped her get her first movie contract. She soon succeeded in "Bulldog Drummond" and over the next decade starred in 33 films. Her major early setback was a final-round loss of the role of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh.         About Hollywood in the 1930's, Miss Bennett recalled: "The industry held a combination of nuts, talents, charlatans and geniuses, all of whom were learning, bumbling and creating with fury and innocence. The colorful types had a passionate love for the business, not just for the money. Today, it seems to me, it's strictly a big business, based on dollars and cents."         Miss Bennett is survived by her fourth husband, David Wilde, a former critic and publisher whom she married in 1973; four daughters, Diana Anderson of Los Angeles and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y., from her second marriage to Gene Markey, a film writer-producer whom she married in 1932 and divorced in 1937, and Stephanie Guest and Shelley Wanger, both of Manhattan, from her marriage to Mr. Wanger, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Tamara De Treaux, the actress who played the role of the lovable alien in the Oscar-winning film "E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial," died on Wednesday.  She was 31 years old.         Miss De Treaux died of respiratory and heart problems at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, said a friend, Ken Maley.         The 31-inch-tall actress started her career in San Francisco theaters and joined a singing group called the Medflies in 1980. Steven Spielberg spotted her during a Medflies performance in Los Angeles and hired her to take on the role of the earthbound alien in "E.T." after the original actor was injured. Miss De Treaux played the creature in scenes that required movement, and a robot was used in close-ups.         Miss De Treaux also appeared in the movies "Ghoulies" and in "Rockula." She recently completed filming "Love in Venice" and "The Linguine Incident."         She is survived by her mother, Barbara Detro, a brother and a sister.       
         Anne Revere, an actress who won acclaim for her screen portrayals of wise, protective motherly characters until her career was cut short by the 1950's Communist blacklist, died yesterday at her home in Locust Valley, L.I. She was 87 years old.         She died of pneumonia, Dr. Howard B. Gotlieb, the director of collections and curator of her archives at Boston University, said.         The stately, spirited character actress won a 1945 Academy Award as the mother of Elizabeth Taylor in "National Velvet." Miss Revere was also nominated for supporting Oscars for playing the mothers of Jennifer Jones in "The Song of Bernadette" (1943) and of Gregory Peck in "Gentleman's Agreement" (1947).         Miss Revere was also the understanding mother of John Garfield in "Body and Soul" (1947) and of Montgomery Clift in "A Place in the Sun" (1951). Her salt-of-the-earth motif was her straight hair carefully combed into a practical bun.         From 1934 to 1951, she was much in demand, appearing in nearly three dozen films, including "The Howards of Virginia," "Old Acquaintance," "The Keys of the Kingdom," "Fallen Angel," "Dragonwyck" and "Forever Amber." But then she was blacklisted by the industry and barred from films for 20 years for refusing to testify about Communist links before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         The actress voluntarily resigned from the board of the Screen Actors Guild in 1951 because she believed her silence on Capitol Hill had barred her from making further films.  Back to the Stage         "Nobody went to jail because they were Communists," she said in an interview in 1975. "They went to jail for contempt. But the awful thing about the whole bloody era was that whether you answered or didn't, cooperated or not, you were dead in the business."         Miss Revere left Hollywood to seek roles on the stage, where she had trained, and starred in regional theaters and stock and occasionally on Broadway. She won a 1960 Tony Award for portraying a rigid spinster opposite Maureen Stapleton and Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's drama "Toys in the Attic."         Anne Revere was born in Manhattan on June 25, 1903. Her father, Clinton, was a stockbroker, and she grew up on the Upper West Side and in Westfield, N.J. She earned a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley College in 1926 and studied at the American Laboratory School in New York City with Maria Ouspenskaya and Richard Boleslavsky.         Miss Revere honed her craft in stock and regional theaters. Her first Broadway triumph was in Lillian Hellman's first play, the 1934 drama "The Children's Hour," as one of two ill-fated teachers at a girls' school falsely accused of lesbianism. The long-running play led to other leading stage roles and her Hollywood contract.         Samuel Rosen, a stage director who was Miss Revere's husband of 49 years, died in 1984. She is survived by a sister, Winn Revere Smith, of Cross River, L.I.       
         Sonya Selby-Wright, an associate producer of special programs for "Good Morning America," died on Wednesday in her home in Point Pleasant, N.J. She was 54 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, said her husband, Julian Mueller.         Born in London, Ms. Selby-Wright moved to the United States in 1963. She was an associate producer of "The Mike Douglas Show" before taking over special programs at "Good Morning America" in 1977.         A profile in Cook's magazine last year credited Ms. Selby-Wright with single-handedly coaching chefs for television appearances and with perfecting the presentation of food on television. She worked with culinary figures including Julia Child, Wolfgang Puck and Lorenzo De Medici. "Her talents for creating a kitchen drama in three and a half minutes were awesome," Mrs. Child said yesterday. "I am indeed indebted to her."         In addition to her husband, Ms. Selby-Wright is survived by her mother, Mary Chamberlain, and a sister, Claire Wright, both of England.         A funeral service is to be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at the Point Pleasant Baptist Church.         Correction:  December 24, 1990, Monday         An obituary on Friday about Sonya Selby-Wright, a television producer, misidentified her residence. It was Point Pleasant, Pa., not New Jersey.       
         Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald and a leading proponent of women's advancement to the top levels of management in American journalism, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami. She was 60 years old.         The Herald said Ms. Chusmir suffered a brain aneurysm on Friday night, aboutan hour after returning to her home in Miami Beach after the paper's evening news conference at her office.         We have lost a great friend and a great editor," said The Herald's publisher, David Lawrence. "What a zest she had for good newspapers; what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right and fair for everyone."         In Ms. Chusmir's three-year tenure as executive editor, The Herald won two Pulitzer Prizes. And in November 1988, less than a year after she was appointed to the paper's top news post, The Herald introduced an enlarged and revamped Spanish-language newspaper, with a separate staff, called El Nuevo Herald. A month ago she was named Editor of the Year by the National Press Foundation, which cited her for "transforming The Herald to serve the unique multicultural population of greater Miami."         When Ms. Chusmir was named The Herald's executive editor in December 1987, about 85 percent of the newsroom executives in the country were men, according to a survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Of the society's 1,000 members -- the top editors of the nation's dailies -- about 80 were women. Opposed Special Position         The dearth of women in high positions was the subject of a seminar at the society's convention in 1988. And when an editor suggested that it was desirable for newspapers to create a "woman's seat" among their top editors, Ms. Chusmir denounced the idea. "The seat becomes devalued," she said, "and the function becomes devalued."         Ms. Chusmir was a feminist who understood the potency of understatement. She recently told a group of Hispanic women: "Pick your battles. It's not good to be fighting over each little thing and male chauvinistic action. Instead, fight for the important things: equal pay and equal respect. Fight smart."         At the same time, she was fond of telling female executives not to forsake their ability to nurture. "I always remind myself that I can't hug a newspaper," she said.         Janet Zoll was born in Boston and earned a journalism degree from Boston University in 1949. A week after graduation she married the editor of her college newspaper, Leonard Chusmir, and soon became a mother and homemaker.         It was not until after moving to Miami Beach with her two school-age children in 1963 that Ms. Chusmir took a job at the Miami Beach Daily Sun, which no longer operates, writing articles at a flat rate of $2.50 each. She was soon given a full-time position. Five Years in Colorado         In 1968, The Herald hired her as a general assignment reporter, and, soon afterward, she was writing a column and receiving awards for her feature writing. In the early 1970's, Ms. Chusmir was named editor of The Herald section News For and About Women, which in her tenure was renamed Living Today. By 1977, she had been promoted to assistant managing editor for features.         Then, in 1982, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, the Herald's corporate parent, appointed her president and publisher of The Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., making her the first female chief executive of one of the organization's newspapers. Five years later, she returned to The Herald as executive editor.         Last year, in an occasional column she wrote, "View From the Newsroom," Ms. Chusmir offered readers a personal glance at herself. She said her favorite avocations were "baking, reading, swimming, dieting." Her favorite place was "my balcony at sunset." And of journalism, she said, "It's a sacred trust."         Besides her husband, Ms. Chusmir is survived by a son, Steven, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro of Daytona Beach, and a grandson.
