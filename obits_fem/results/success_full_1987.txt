        Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.''         In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly.         She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck         Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success.         With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.''         The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy.         Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own         According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948.         When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices.         During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies.         After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985.         Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.       
        Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         The daughter of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson and Lady Gertrude Forbes-Robertson, a well-known actor and actress, Mrs. Sheean was born in London and spent most of her childhood in Kent, near the cliffs of Dover. ''There the great events of the village,'' she recalled, ''were the arrivals of Channel swimmers and German mines, which still washed up on the beach from time to time.''         Mrs. Sheean, whose nickname was Dinah, wrote several books, including ''The Battle of Waterloo Road'' (1941), illustrated by Robert Capa's photographs, about the people in Britain during the war; ''War Letters From Britain'' (1941), edited with Roger W. Straus Jr.; ''A Cat and a King'' (1949), a novel about the theater, and ''My Aunt Maxine'' (1964), a biography of her aunt, Maxine Elliott, the American actress. #3 Plays 'Fizzed Out'         She was educated at boarding schools and at a French school in London, and she lived for several months with a family in Vienna. Her only connection with the theater, aside from the involvement of her parents, was writing three plays that, in her words, ''fizzed out.''         In 1935 she married Vincent Sheean, the noted American foreign correspondent, whose book ''Personal History'' was published to great success that year. They traveled widely in Spain, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Europe before settling in the United States.         During those travels Mrs. Sheean wrote dispatches to The New York Herald Tribune, and before and during World War II she was active in committees raising money and distributing food for Spanish refugee children and victims of Nazism.         The Sheeans were divorced in 1946 and remarried in 1949.         Mrs. Sheean is survived by two daughters, Linda, of New York City, and Ellen, of London.       
        Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Miss Kaye was one of the foremost ballerinas of her time. Although she danced many classical roles, she became known for creating a new contemporary look among dancers, especially in Antony Tudor's dance-dramas in the 1940's and 1950's.         In an era when ballet was considered a Russian art, Miss Kaye remained steadfastly an American dancer. Her last name was originally Koreff, but she changed it to Kaye because ''an American dancer ought to have an American name,'' as she put it.         Called the ''Duse of the dance,'' Miss Kaye excelled in dramatic roles. The world premiere by Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, of Mr. Tudor's psychological ballet ''Pillar of Fire'' catapulted her to stardom in 1942. Symbol of Tenacity and Vigor         Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ballet Theater's current artistic director, said of the ballerina: ''She was undoubtedly a great woman of the theater and a symbol to any dancer of tenacity, vigor and what it means to be a great star. Everyone in the dance world mourns her and is sad today.''         Miss Kaye was a charter member of Ballet Theater from the company's first year, 1939. There she worked with Mr. Tudor, one of the company's choreographers and teachers, who revealed ballet to her as an expressive art.         During Ballet Theater's first New York season early in 1940, she danced in the chorus of several Tudor ballets. The choreographer offered Miss Kaye her first important dramatic or character role, that of the Russian ballerina in his comic ballet ''Gala Performance,'' for its premiere in February 1941.         But it was her portrayal of the sexually repressed Hagar in ''Pillar of Fire,'' that raised Miss Kaye to the status of prima ballerina and helped make her one of the best-known American ballerinas in the world.         Reviewing the ballet at its premiere in April 1942, John Martin, then dance critic of The New York Times, rated Miss Kaye's characterization as among ''the great examples of tragic acting of its generation.'' 'I Wanted to Extend Myself'         By 1943, Miss Kaye was dancing most of the lead female roles in the Ballet Theater repertory. She performed with the company through 1951, when she left to dance with the New York City Ballet.         She was not well suited to the City Ballet style, however. though she had notable triumphs, among them her portrayal of the man-killing Novice in ''The Cage,'' which Jerome Robbins created for her. ''I wanted to extend myself,'' she said in 1977 of her years with City Ballet, ''but I was wrong for it.'' She returned to Ballet Theater in 1954 and danced with the company until 1959. She retired from the stage in 1961.         Miss Kaye was known as a Tudor ballerina, but she danced ballets by many other contemporary choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, George Balanchine, Valerie Bettis, Kenneth MacMillan, John Taras and Herbert Ross, whom she married in 1959.         Born in New York City, and named after the heroine of ''A Doll's House,'' Miss Kaye was exposed at an early age to Stanislavskian acting by her father, Gregory Koreff, a former actor with the Moscow Art Theater. She began studying dance at the age of 5, working with the celebrated choreographer Michel Fokine.         At 8, Miss Kaye entered Margaret Curtis's ballet class at the Metropolitan Opera school. At 15, she graduated into the Metropolitan Opera's corps de ballet and danced with the American Ballet, a company founded by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, when it became the Metropolitan's resident ballet troupe in 1935. She also studied at the School of American Ballet and with such noted teachers as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmila Shollar and Margaret Craske.         She then abandoned ballet for several years, feeling, as she later said, that it was ''something dragged up from 300 years ago that didn't make any sense and wasn't going anyplace.'' She performed in musical comedies, among them ''Virginia,'' in 1937, ''Great Lady'' (1938), ''Stars in Your Eyes'' (1939) and, in 1952, ''Two's Company.'' She also danced in the Radio City Music Hall corps de ballet for nine months in the late 1930's. Assisted on Film Projects         Miss Kaye was associate artistic director of Ballet Theater from 1977 to 1983. In later years, she also assisted Mr. Ross, by then a well-known film and stage producer and director, in his projects. Miss Kaye served as executive producer of ''The Turning Point,'' a 1977 film whose story was said to have been drawn from her own life, though she denied the rumor. Last summer, she assisted Mr. Ross in his filming of ''Giselle.''         Other credits included work as executive producer or co-producer on the films ''The Last of Sheila,'' ''The Seven Percent Solution,'' ''Nijinsky,'' ''Pennies From Heaven'' and ''The Secret of My Success.''         ''As an American ballerina,'' Miss Kaye wrote in 1950 in Theater Arts magazine, ''I never take anything for granted. I question each tradition, each interpretation, each movement. The answers I have found, sometimes right and sometimes wrong, constitute my contribution to the young American dancer of ballet: not to accept until you understand (at least to your own satisfaction), and not to dance any role, ancient or new, until you do understand. This urge to question and to discover is, I think, the trademark of American ballet.''         Miss Kaye is survived by Mr. Ross. Earlier marriages to Michael Van Buren and Isaac Stern, the violinist, ended in divorce. The funeral is on Monday at 4 P.M. at the Westwood Village Mortuary in Los Angeles.

        Maria Augusta von Trapp, the guiding force behind a family of singers who won world reknown when their story was portrayed in the play and film ''The Sound of Music,'' died of heart failure yesterday in Morrisville, Vt., three days after undergoing surgery.

She was 82 years old, and had lived in Stowe, Vt., for more than 40 years.         The story of the von Trapp family, which fled Austria to avoid complicity with Nazi rule and toured the United States as the Trapp Family Choir, was transformed into one of the movie industry's greatest financial successes, with the release of ''The Sound of Music'' starring Julie Andrews in 1965.         Baroness von Trapp, who had studied to become a nun before marrying an Austrian war hero, Baron Georg von Trapp, in 1927, said she and the rest of the family received little of the $180 million in revenues from the film. However, she praised it for honestly depicting her life story and for bringing joy and hope to millions of people. In interviews, she repeatedly asserted her faith in God and devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. Praised Film's Influence         ''The great good the film and the play are doing to individual lives is far beyond money,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times shortly after the film's release. ''There seems to be so much despair in the world. But so many people write about how much the film has helped them in restoring their confidence in God.''         Born on a train speeding from her parent's Tyrol village to a hospital in Vienna in 1905, Maria Augusta Kutschera was an orphan by her seventh birthday. She was raised by a court-appointed guardian, whom she described as a passionate socialist and extremely anti-Catholic.         After she graduated from the State Teachers College for Progressive Education in Vienna at age 18, she became a candidate for the novitiate at a Benedictine convent in Salzberg. Choice of Church or Family         The abbess of the convent sent her to become a governess at the villa outside Salzberg of Baron Georg von Trapp, a highly decorated submarine commander during World War I, who had retired with his seven children after his first wife's death. The young woman quickly won the affection of the children and, when the Baron proposed marriage, she was torn between her devotion to the church and the family.         She married the Baron in November 1927. The couple later had three children.         The family often sang together, particularly during religious observances. In 1935, a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Franz Waner, came to live with the family and began to tutor the children in Renaissance and Baroque music.         In August 1936, the family's informal singing became a professional enterprise when they won a choral competition at the Salzberg Festival. The Trapp Family Choir conducted a full tour of Europe the next year.         When Austria fell under Nazi rule in March 1938, the family realized that its performances could only continue if it cooperated with the Government. They fled with only a few possessions to Italy, then sailed on to New York, arriving penniliess. Concert at Town Hall         Their first major concert, which brought the Trapp Family Choir national attention, took place in New York in Town Hall on Dec. 10, 1938. In a review of their opening performance, The New York Times commented:         ''There was something unusually lovable and appealing about the modest, serious singers of this little family aggregation as they formed a close semicircle about their self-effacing director for their initial offering, the handsome Mme. von Trapp in simple black, and the youthful sisters garbed in black and white Austrain folk costumes enlivened with red ribbons. It was only natural to expect work of exceeding refinement from them, and one was not disappointed in this.''         The von Trapps toured Europe and the United States the next year, gaining an international reputation for the seven daughters and three sons who sang madrigals and old carols, played ancient instruments and re-enacted family customs on stage. For 15 years, their Christmas concerts at Town Hall were a tradition of the New York Yuletide season.         The family bought a 660-acre farm in Stowe in 1942, which later became a lodge and summer music camp.         The Baron died in 1947 at the age of 57. She Lectured Extensively         The family continued to perform around the world until 1955, and the Baroness lectured and wrote extensively on the family's hardships, faith in God and unity. Her book, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,'' was published in 1949. After her husband's death, she also became heavily involved in Catholic missionary work.         The play, ''The Sound of Music,'' with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, opened on Broadway in the fall of 1959, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. It was a tremendous success, running for more than three years. The film version set box office records around the world, but the Baroness von Trapp said she received only about $500,000 in royalties.         The Baroness received the Honorary Cross First Class from the Austrian Government for improving cultural ties between her native country and the United States, and numerous awards from the Roman Catholic church.         She is survived by a son, Johannes, of Stowe; two daughters, Eleonore Campbell of Waitsfield, Vt., and Rosmarie Trapp of Pittsburgh; two stepsons, Rupert, of Stowe, and Werner, of Waitsfield; three stepdaughters, Agathe von Trapp of Glyndon, Md., Maria F. Trapp of Papua, New Guinea, and Johanna von Trapp of San Diego, and by 29 grandchildren.

Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Miss Greenwood's son, Jason Morrell, said his mother was found dead Saturday by friends she had invited to dinner. Mr. Morrell did not give a cause of his mother's death, but a BBC news report said she had apparently suffered a heart attack.         Miss Greenwood appeared on stage only two weeks ago in a sketch with Robert Morley at the Prince of Wales Theater in London. Mr. Morrell said his mother had not been ill recently.         Known primarily as a comic actress, Miss Greenwood starred in a series of British films in the 1940's and 50's that are now considered classics.         One of her frequent co-stars was Sir Alec Guinness, with whom she made ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' ''The Man in the White Suit'' and ''The Detective,'' a movie based on G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown books. In Film Version of 'Ernest'         Miss Greenwood also appeared with Michael Redgrave in the film version of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Ernest'' and with Basil Rathbone in ''Tight Little Island,'' a screen adaptation of Compton Mackenzie's novel ''Whiskey Galore.''         Miss Greenwood, born in the Chelsea section of London on March 4, 1921, was the daughter of Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood, an artist. She began taking dancing lessons when she was 8 years old, studied at St. Catherine's School in Surrey, and continued to take ballet lessons until she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at 17.         Her first stage appearance came at age 18 when she appeared as Louisa in Moliere's ''Malade Imaginaire'' at the Apollo Theater in London. Performances in ''Little Ladyship'' and ''The Women'' followed.         Leslie Howard saw her in ''The Women'' and made Miss Greenwood his leading lady in the film ''The Gentle Sex.'' From then on Miss Greenwood alternated film and stage work.         She appeared in the role of Wendy in ''Peter Pan'' and as Elie Dunn in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House,'' then undertook more serious roles, playing Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' with the Donald Wolfit company, Nora in Ibsen's ''Doll House,'' Celia in ''Volpone'' and Sabina in ''The Young Wives' Tale.'' Developed a Following         Her film career rocketed with the success of ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' and Miss Greenwood gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. She appeared on Broadway with Claude Rains in 1953 in T. S. Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.''         Miss Greenwood's career had recently revived with appearances in several British television series. Her son said yesterday: ''She enjoyed doing all the recent TV work. She kept a trueness to herself. If she didn't want to do something, she wouldn't do it.''         Miss Greenwood was married in 1960 to the actor Andre Morrell, who died in 1978. She is survived by her son.         Correction:  March 19, 1987, Thursday, Late City Final Edition       
        Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the         Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Sullivan, who had a busy career both in this country and abroad, gave her last performance March 22 at the Westport Arts Center in Westport, Conn. She entered the hospital April 1, where she suffered a seizure and went into a coma.         Miss Sullivan was born Marietta Williams in Homestead, Pa., on May 13, 1911. She shot to fame in 1937 when she recorded ''Loch Lomond'' in an arrangement by Claude Thornhill, the pianist, who led a small accompanying group on the recording. It was an immediate hit, and she followed it with a series of recordings of swinging folk songs, including ''Molly Malone,'' ''It Was a Lover and His Lass'' and ''If I Had a Ribbon Bow.''         Although singing folk songs appeared to be a novelty at that time, Miss Sullivan was doing it in the very earliest stages of her career, when she was singing at an after-hours club in Pittsburgh called the Benjamin Harrison Literary Society.         Two of her future husbands, the bassist John Kirby and the pianist Cliff Jackson both first heard her singing there.         One of her songs was a musical setting of Joyce Kilmer's poem ''Trees.''         ''I couldn't sing it straight,'' she explained. ''I had no choice but to swing it.'' Married in 1938         The success of ''Loch Lomond'' led to an engagement for her at the Onyx Club on 52d Street. There she sang with a small band led by Mr. Kirby that played in a light and airy style, once described as ''orchestrated finesse'' that was an ideal complement to Miss Sullivan's singing and to her manner when she sang, standing motionless, her chin tilted confidently upward and a slightly mischievous smile lighting her face.         She married Mr. Kirby in 1938 and later she and his band became the stars of a weekly NBC radio network series, ''Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm,'' a precedent-setting event for black performers.         In 1938 Miss Sullivan went from the Onyx Club to Hollywood to appear in the film ''Going Places,'' in which she and Louis Armstrong introduced ''Jeepers Creepers.'' The following year she appeared in a second film, ''St. Louis Blues,'' and also performed on Broadway with Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman in a jazz version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' called ''Swingin' the Dream,'' in which she sang ''Darn That Dream.''         During the 1940's she moved away from her early close association with folk songs, although until her death she could always respect - and respond to - requests for ''Loch Lomond.'' She developed a fresh repertory of standard pop songs such as ''I've Got the World on a String,'' ''Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'' and ''I Got a Right to Sing the Blues.'' Won Tony Award in 1979         In 1950, after her marriage to Mr. Kirby had ended in divorce, she married Mr. Jackson and temporarily retired from singing to raise her daughter, Paula. During these years she developed an interest in physical therapy and nursing and was active in local civic affairs in the Bronx. After Mr. Jackson's death in 1970, she founded the House That Jazz Built, a community center at 1312 Stebbins Avenue in the Bronx. Dedicated to Mr. Jackson, the center continues to serve young people through the efforts of senior citizens.         In 1979 she received a Tony award for her performance in ''My Old Friends,'' a musical on aging that was described by a reviewer for The New York Times as ''jolly yet touching.''         She is survived by her daughter, Paula Morris, and her son, Orville Williams.

        Anni Frind, who sang leading soubrette soprano roles in both opera and operetta in the 1920's and 30's, died Wednesday in New Orleans. She was 87 years old.         Anni Frind, who sang leading soubrette soprano roles in both opera and operetta in the 1920's and 30's, died Wednesday in New Orleans. She was 87 years old.         Ms. Frind was born on Feb. 2, 1900. She made her debut in 1922 at the Berlin Volksoper and later sang at the Munich State Opera, the Dresden State Opera and the German Opera House in Berlin. She had a brilliant success in the world premiere of ''Casanova'' in 1928 and thereafter devoted her energies mainly to operetta. Ms. Frind appeared as Adele in Max Reinhardt's production of ''Die Fledermaus'' 200 times. She made many recordings for HMV and Odeon.         An early and outspoken opponent of the Nazis, she curtailed her activities in Germany upon the ascent of Hitler. During World War II, she sang for Allied soldiers at the front and worked as a volunteer nurse. After the war, she moved to New Orleans, where she taught singing as Anni Frind-Sperling.       
        Helen M. Strauss, who created the literary department at the William Morris agency and became a major influence in the worlds of books, motion pictures and the theater, died of cancer yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. Miss Strauss, 83 years old and a resident of Manhattan, had been ill for almost a year.         Helen M. Strauss, who created the literary department at the William Morris agency and became a major influence in the worlds of books, motion pictures and the theater, died of cancer yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. Miss Strauss, 83 years old and a resident of Manhattan, had been ill for almost a year.         Miss Strauss was born in New York City, and began her career with the story department of Paramount Pictures before joining the Morris agency in 1944. Until then the agency had handled mostly show business figures, but Miss Strauss was asked to establish the literary department. She also served for more than 20 years as a member of the company's executive committee.         Miss Strauss put together a formidable client list that eventually included James Michener, Robert Penn Warren, Leon Edel, Ralph Ellison, Dame Edith Sitwell, Archibald MacLeish, Gore Vidal, Gerold Frank, Betty Smith, Justice William O. Douglas and Frank Yerby.         Mr. Michener, one of Miss Strauss's early clients and one of six who won the Pulitzer Prize, dedicated the Modern Library edition of his selected writings to her as a ''friend of writers.'' 'Gave Me Only Good Counsel'         Yesterday, he described Miss Strauss as an ''admirable'' agent. ''She did not hold a writer's hand or get him tickets to a favorite show or buy him shirts at Macy's,'' he said. ''What she did was advise him on the problems of his profession. She helped enormously those she took under her wing, and I was one of her first clients, and had a long, very happy relationship with her. She gave me only good counsel.'' But Miss Strauss was not a friend of all writers. Her 1979 autobiography, ''A Talent for Luck,'' gave what one reviewer described as ''a brief twist of the knife'' to writers she did not like, either personally or professionally. In fact, she attributed part of her success to not hesitating to drop writers who displeased her.         Mr. Frank said yesterday that Miss Strauss had run her department with an iron hand. ''She was autocratic, firm and decisive, but very loyal,'' he said. ''And she knew what made a book work.''         Owen Laster, who succeeded Miss Strauss as head of the Morris literary department, described her as dynamic and controversial. ''But above all,'' he said, ''she had an eye for selecting and working with extraordinarily talented writers.'' 'The King and I' Her Idea         Miss Strauss was credited with originating the idea of ''The King and I,'' the musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d starring Gertrude Lawrence.         She moved to the Morris agency's London office in 1966, but resigned from the company a year later to become vice president of world story operations for Warner Brothers-Seven Arts. She later joined Universal Pictures as a vice president, and in the early 1970's she was in charge of motion picture production for Reader's Digest Films. She produced ''The Incredible Sarah,'' a 1976 film starring Glenda Jackson as Sarah Bernhardt.         Miss Strauss spoke little about her personal life, and even her autobiography described an early marriage as ''a fiasco, though all my friends thought he was charming.''         There are no survivors, and friends said funeral arrangements would be private.         HELEN M. STRAUSS DIES AT 83       
        Dalida, an Egyptian-born singer and actress who first won fame in France for her song ''Bambino'' in 1954, was found dead Sunday from an apparent overdose of barbiturates, according to family members. She was 54 years old.         Dalida, an Egyptian-born singer and actress who first won fame in France for her song ''Bambino'' in 1954, was found dead Sunday from an apparent overdose of barbiturates, according to family members. She was 54 years old.         Dalida, whose real name was Yolande Gigliotti, was born in 1933 and was an entertainment success in Europe and the Middle East for more than 30 years. Her records sold more than 85 million copies and her repertory included more than 400 songs in French, 200 in Italian and 200 in other languages. Her father, Pietro Gigliotti, was a violinist with the Cairo Opera.       
        Elizabeth Hartman, who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress in 1966 for her role in ''A Patch of Blue,'' died in a fall from her fifth-floor apartment in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.         Elizabeth Hartman, who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress in 1966 for her role in ''A Patch of Blue,'' died in a fall from her fifth-floor apartment in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.         According to the Pittsburgh police, Miss Hartman, who was 45 years old, had called her doctor a short time earlier, saying she was depressed. They listed her death as a possible suicide.         Miss Hartman enjoyed sudden success as a film actress following her ''Patch'' role and Academy Award nomination, but her career declined in succeeding years.         ''That initial success beat me down,'' Miss Hartman, a tense, fragile-looking redhead, said in a 1969 interview. ''It spiraled me into a position where I didn't belong. I was not ready for that. I suddenly found myself failing.''         She said she sat around her East 68th Street apartment for two years doing nothing but reading and brooding. Her mood finally lifted with her debut on Broadway in the role of Emily in a revival of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town.''         She had major roles in ''The Group,'' ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and ''The Fixer.'' She co-starred with Clint Eastwood in ''The Beguiled'' in 1971 and was in ''Walking Tall'' in 1973..       
        Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Miss Page, who had been performing in ''Blithe Spirit'' on Broadway since spring, did not arrive for Saturday's two performances. At the end of the evening show, the play's producer, Karl Allison, announced that she had died. Her role in ''Blithe Spirit'' was assumed by her understudy, Patricia Conolly.         Mr. Allison described the other members of the cast as devastated by the news. ''She was such a wonderfully sweet person, on top of being such an extraordinary actress,'' he said.         Born in Kirksville, Mo., on Nov. 22, 1924, Miss Page grew up in Chicago and later traced her love of acting to plays that she had done with a church youth group. 'To Be Good at Something'         ''I always wanted to be good at something, to be somebody,'' she once wrote in a sketch of herself for The New Yorker. ''The minute I got into my first play, which was called ''Excuse My Dust'' - I was 17 at the time - I knew that this was what I'd been looking for.''         After graduating from high school in 1942, Miss Page spent three years studying at the Goodman Theater School in Chicago. With 11 other students - they each chipped in $35 - she formed a stock theater company that operated for four seasons from a playhouse outside the city.         In the late 1940's, Miss Page moved to New York, where she worked as a hat-check girl, a spool winder in a thread factory and a negligee model while stalking the theater district for work.         ''The first rule of survival was to stretch every penny,'' she once said. ''I'd eat in a restaurant that featured soup and free rolls for 15 cents and I'd stuff my pockets with rolls. Fortunately, food didn't mean much to me.'' First Big Break in '52         Her first big acting break came in 1952, when the director Jose Quintero cast her as the lovelorn Alma Winemiller in his production of Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' which played Off Broadway at the Circle in the Square.         In that role, she attracted such praise that the next year she made her Broadway debut, in ''Midsummer'' by Vina Delmar. Though the show received mediocre reviews, the critics once again raved about Miss Page, and the producers raised her to star billing.         On Broadway, she went on to star in ''The Immoralist'' in 1954, an adaption of the Gide novel; in N. Richard Nash's ''Rainmaker,'' also in 1954, and in Williams's ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' in 1959.         More recently, she appeared in John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God'' in 1982, and Off Broadway in Sam Shepard's ''Lie of the Mind'' in 1985.         Miss Page was perhaps best known for her interpretations of Williams's obsessive heroines. In 1980 she played Zelda Fitzgerald in the Williams drama ''Clothes for a Summer Hotel.'' 'Disciplined and Dedicated'         The playwright once described her as ''the most disciplined and dedicated of actresses.''         She rejected another characterization of her - as an actress best suited to the roles of neurotic women. ''It's a myth based on nothing,'' she said.         ''A lot of people say I always play neurotic women,'' she said. ''Well, who doesn't play neurotic women?''         The career of Miss Page, who shunned many of the trappings of stardom, was marked by periods of relative obscurity broken by sudden rediscovery. In 1962, with the release of the film versions of ''Summer and Smoke'' and ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' she found herself, after 10 years on the stage, being hailed as an ''overnight success.''         ''That's the longest night I've ever seen,'' she said at the time.         Miss Page's film credits included ''Hondo,'' in which she played opposite John Wayne, in 1954; ''The Happiest Millionaire'' in 1967, and ''The Day of the Locust'' in 1975. In recent years, she appeared in ''The Pope of Greenwich Village'' in 1984 and ''The Trip to Bountiful'' in 1985. A Belated Oscar         Nominated for an Oscar eight times without winning, Miss Page finally received the award for best actress for her performance in ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' In the movie, she played Carrie Watts, an old woman who finally fulfills her long desire to return to her childhood home of Bountiful, a Texas town that has by then disappeared. Of her performance, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''As Mrs. Watts, Geraldine Page has never been in better form or in more control of that complex, delicate mechanism that makes her one of our finest actresses.''         ''She was not a gal who worried about the fashion of the times,'' said the playwright, Horton Foote, a longtime friend of the actress and the author of the screenplay for ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' ''She had enormous individuality. She just wasn't a theater provincial and her work reflected that.''         In the New Yorker sketch, Miss Page gave her own views on what makes a successful actor: ''The main thing is the ability to control your instrument, which in the actor, is yourself. Look the way you want the character to look. Sound the way you want the character to sound. Once you've trained the instrument to do what you want, you're in control and you're free.''         Despite her successful Hollywood career, Miss Page remained a strong supporter of repertory theater throughout her life, often acting in them at a low salary and in supporting roles. Recently, as a member of the Mirror Repertory Company, she appeared in ''The Madwoman of Chaillot.''         Miss Page won two Emmy awards for her television performances, both in the late 1960's for roles in adaptations of Truman Capote stories, ''A Christmas Memory'' and ''The Thanksgiving Visitor.''         Miss Page is survived by her third husband, the actor Rip Torn; their three children, Jonathan, Anthony and Angelica Torn-Burkhardt; a grandchild, Elija Burkhardt, and a brother, Donald.         A memorial service will be held at the Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52d Street, at 11 A.M. on Wednesday.

        Dorothy Blanchard Hammerstein, a former New York interior designer and the widow of the lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Dorothy Blanchard Hammerstein, a former New York interior designer and the widow of the lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         A woman of commanding presence, Mrs. Hammerstein was considered a great beauty throughout her life. Of medium height, with bright blue eyes and, in her later years, snowy white hair, she was known for her flawless carriage and ready wit.         In the early 1930's, Mrs. Hammerstein founded an interior design business, Dorothy Hammerstein Inc., and quickly established herself as one of the most sought-after decorators on both coasts. She retired in the mid-1950's.         In 1949, with her husband and the novelist Pearl Buck, she was a founder of Welcome House (now Welcome House Adoption Sevices) in Doylestown, Pa., an organization that arranges for the adoption of children of American and Asian parents.         She was also actively involved with the Dance Theater of Harlem Inc., both as a board member and as a member of its national advisory board, from its inception in 1969 until her death. Born in Australia         Born in Tasmania, Australia, Mrs. Hammerstein was one of five daughters of Henry James Blanchard, a master mariner, and his wife, the former Marion Parmentier. At the age of 23, Dorothy Blanchard left Melbourne for London, seeking a movie career. Meeting with little success, she decided to return to Australia by way of New York.         In Manhattan, she joined the cast of ''Charlot's Revue,'' an English musical starring Beatrice Lillie. When the show closed in New York, she toured the United States and Canada for a year as Miss Lillie's understudy.         In 1925 she married Henry Jacobson, a New York businessman, with whom she had two children. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1929 she married Mr. Hammerstein. The marriage lasted until his death in 1960.         Mrs. Hammerstein is survived by a sister, Eleanor Biow of Santa Barbara, Calif.; two sons, Henry Jacobson of Santa Barbara and James Blanchard Hammerstein of Manhattan and London; a daughter, Susan Blanchard of Manhattan; two stepchildren, William Hammerstein of Kent, Conn., and Alice Mathias of Harrison, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
        Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Astor entered silent films in 1920 as a willowy 14-year-old and portrayed scores of vulnerable ingenues. Two decades later she gave her most indelible performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' John Huston's crime classic. Her subtle, mature portrayal of a seemingly sympathetic woman who was, in fact, evilly duplicitous, took audiences by surprise. Such women were rarely the heroines of movies then, nor had they been portrayed as deceptively as Miss Astor portrayed the homicidal Brigid O'Shaughnessy.         In the same year, 1941, she was a ruthless, egocentric concert pianist battling Bette Davis in ''The Great Lie,'' for which Miss Astor won an Oscar as the best actress in a supporting role. ''If I'd had my druthers,'' she later wrote, ''I would have preferred getting my Oscar for 'The Maltese Falcon.' '' Sophisticates and Villains         Other skillful characterizations included a warmly urbane widow in ''Dodsworth'' (1936), a spurned mistress in the 1937 version of the swashbuckling ''Prizoner of Zenda,'' a disillusioned wife in ''The Hurricane'' (1937) and a sympathetic prostitute in ''Act of Violence'' (1949).         But few of her films matched the turmoil of her private life. In 1936, she was the center of one of Hollywood's most spectacular scandals when she sued Dr. Franklyn Thorpe for legal custody of their 4-year-old daughter, Marylyn. Dr. Thorpe had divorced Miss Astor a year earlier.         The suit led to disclosure of her diary, which allegedly contained accounts of liaisons with many celebrities. Dr. Thorpe sought to use the diary to prove she was an unfit mother, and purported excerpts were published in newspapers under suggestive headlines.         Miss Astor repeatedly maintained that the excerpts were lurid forgeries. She later acknowledged that an authentic portion published by one newspaper included ''a rather overemotional account of a romantic interlude with George S. Kaufman,'' the playwright.         The trial judge ordered the diary sealed and impounded. It was inadmissible as evidence, she wrote later, because her former husband had removed pages involving himself. Miss Astor was granted custody of her daughter for nine months a year, with Dr. Thorpe allowed custody the three other months. The diary was never made public, and a judge witnessed its burning in 1952. Won Beauty Contest at 11         During the 30-day trial, Hollywood producers, fearing the scandal would damage the film industry, pressed Miss Astor to drop the suit, but she refused, risking her reputation and career to keep her daughter. Soon after the trial, throngs of people hailed her courage when she toured with screenings of ''Dodsworth.''         Mary Astor was born Lucile Langhanke on May 3, 1906, in Quincy, Ill., the only child of the former Helen Vasconcells, an American, and Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke, a German immigrant who made an uncertain income from such diverse activities as teaching German and poultry farming until he began to cash in on his daughter's film success.         The girl won her first movie contract with Famous Players-Lasky and, with it, the name Mary Astor. Within two years she was making features and her salary started soaring. In 1923, the family went to Hollywood and she became John Barrymore's leading lady in ''Beau Brummel.''         She was teamed with Barrymore again in ''Don Juan'' (1926), which introduced a Vitaphone background-music soundtrack, the harbinger of talkies. Her early sound films included ''Holiday'' (1930), playing the materialistic sister of Ann Harding, and ''Red Dust'' (1932), in which she portrayed a frustrated wife attracted to Clark Gable. Sued for Nonsupport by Parents         Later movies included ''Midnight'' (1939), ''Brigham Young - Frontiersman'' (1940), ''Across the Pacific'' (1942), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942), ''Claudia and David'' (1946) and ''Return to Peyton Place'' (1961).         Miss Astor's professional successes were punctuated by personal tragedies. In 1930, her first husband, Kenneth Hawks, was killed in a plane crash while directing a movie.         Her parents lived lavishly, taking nearly all her salary, but in 1934 she put them on an allowance. Unable to continue embellishing the mansion and estate she had given them, they sued her for nonsupport. She said that ''from 1920 to 1930, I gave my father $461,000'' while she kept only $24,000. She agreed to pay them $100 a month, and the suit was dismissed.         After the diary scandal, Miss Astor was married to Manuel del Campo, a Mexican sportsman, by whom she had a son, Anthony, and later to Thomas G. Wheelock, a businessman. Both marriages ended in divorce. A Drinking Problem         Her tangled personal life and the financial pressures to keep working worsened a longtime drinking problem. She sought help from a priest-psychologist, the Rev. Peter Ciklic, and to further her therapy, he had her write notes about her life. At his urging, she revised the notes into a 1959 autobiography, ''My Story.'' It was praised by reviewers for its style and uncompromising insights.         Personally regenerated, she began writing novels and completed a successful memoir on movie making, ''A Life on Film,'' in 1971. Her first novel, ''The Incredible Charlie Carewe,'' about a charming rotter, was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as ''lively entertainment.''         In ''A Life on Film,'' Miss Astor deplored a ''poverty of spirit'' in many contemporary movies, writing that ''whatever we did - we old moviemakers - we gave people a lot of fun. Through depressions and wars and calamities, we gave them the sense of glory, of a future that would be braver than today.''         Miss Astor retired to the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills in 1974 and contributed to it from her writing income.         Besides her daughter and son, the actress is survived by an undisclosed number of grandchildren. A funeral service will be private.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.

Dana Suesse, a composer and songwriter whose hits included ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' died of a stroke last Friday in New York City. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Suesse, who also wrote ''Whistling in the Dark,'' ''My Silent Love'' and ''Blue Moonlight,'' achieved widespread fame in 1932 when the orchestra leader Paul Whiteman commissioned her to write a jazz concerto for piano and orchestra. The work, ''Concerto in Three Rhythms,'' was such a success that the next year, another Whiteman commission, ''Symphonic Waltzes,'' followed.         Miss Suesse, who was born in Shreveport, La., in 1911, came to New York in 1931 with her mother, an opera singer, and began working as a songwriter; her first hit was ''Have You Forgotten?'' in 1931. Her best-known song, ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' written in 1934 with Edward Heyman, has remained Hollywood's anthem for 52 years.         In 1936 she wrote the score for Billy Rose's ''Casa Manana'' revue, and later collaborated with him on his ''Aquacade'' revue at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Miss Suesse also worked with the lyricists Harold Adamson, E. Y. Harburg, Irving Kahl and Leo Robin.         In the late 1940's, Miss Suesse studied composition with Nadia Boulanger. She was also a pianist, and appeared as soloist in many of her own works.         Miss Suesse is survived by her stepson, Charles DeLincks.
