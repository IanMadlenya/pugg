         Beatrice I. Lerner, a longtime Democratic party worker and government aide in New Jersey and a leader in Jewish, cultural and charitable causes, died on Monday at the Cedar Grove Manor Convalescent Home in Cedar Grove, N.J. She was 76 years old and was a resident of South Orange, N.J.         She died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Mrs. Lerner worked as an assistant to Senator Harrison A. Williams and Governors Robert Meyner and Brendan T. Byrne. She also worked in the presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy and George McGovern.         She served as president of the Garden State Ballet and the New Jersey Ballet and on the board of the Zionist Organization of America.         A native of Newark, Mrs. Lerner studied drama at New York University and wrote several plays.         Surviving are her husband, Joseph H., a retired judge; a daughter, Patricia Vradenburg, a screenwriter, of Encino, Calif.; a son, Michael, editor of Tikkun magazine, of Berkeley, Calif.; a brother, Irving Hirschman of Basking Ridge, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.         Then she returned to the university's law school, becoming its third female graduate. She worked in her father's firm, then married Reuben Oscar Everett and worked with him. Later she was a partner in the firm of Everett and Hancock. Her practice was mostly probate, real estate and family law.         She served 20 years on the Durham City Council after being elected in nonpartisan balloting. She was active in the real estate business and was a founder of WRDC-TV in Raleigh, N.C. She was also an elder in the First Presbyterian Church.         Surviving are her son, Robinson O. Everett of Durham, retired chief judge of the United States Court of Military Appeals, and three grandsons.       
         Shirley R. Levittan, an Acting State Supreme Court judge from 1974 until she retired last year, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pemphigus vulgaris, a rare skin disease, a court spokeswoman said.         Before her service on the State Supreme Court, Justice Levittan sat on New York City's Criminal Court and Civil Court, where she was first appointed in 1969. Before her appointment, she was a law clerk to Justice Samuel H. Hofstadler of State Supreme Court.         Judge Levittan, who was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 8, 1918, graduated from Barnard College in 1939 and received a master's degree in French literature a year later at Syracuse University. During World War II, she was attached to the Office of Strategic Services in Paris, London and Germany. She also worked as the executive assistant to the Principal of the Ramaz School, a Jewish day school on Manhattan's East Side. Taught French and English         After traveling and teaching English and French, she entered New York Law School, where she got a law degree in 1956. She worked for several years in private practice and was appointed to several state and city commissions, including the Temporary Commission on the Courts, where she drafted reports on the Family Court and adoption as well as drafted proposed legislation.         Justice Levittan served as an officer of the New York Women's Bar Association and was a member of the New York city and state bar associations and the National Association of Women Lawyers.         During her judicial career, she wrote and lectured often on the Constitution, adoption, pornography, alimony and divorce and the rights of children.         The judge, who was not married, is survived by a sister-in-law, Olive Levittan of Halifax, Nova Scotia.       
         Rose Korn Hirschman, a real-estate lawyer and volunteer at the United Nations and other organizations, died Jan. 24 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver failure, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up there and in Brooklyn. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at New York University. She began practicing law in Manhattan with her brother, Ashton Korn, and after his death worked on her own.         For nine years she represented the International Federation of Women Lawyers at United Nations commissions dealing with discrimination, minorities, women, economics, crime, commodities trade, human rights and population growth.         She was a past president of the Sisterhood of the Community Synagogue, vice president of the Congregation Emanuel Sisterhood and chairwoman of its youth activities and board member of the Young Women's Hebrew Association. She headed the Mount Vernon branch of the American Red Cross and served on the board of its Westchester County chapter. She was also on the boards of the Mount Vernon Nursing School and Mount Vernon Hospital and founded the hospital's volunteer services.         Her husband, Dr. Sol Hirschman, is dead. She is survived by two daughters, Judge Aileen Hirschman Belford of Fall River, Mass., and E. Judith Hirschman Berger of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Richard James Hirschman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Later, she taught social work at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and maintained an active practice in cognitive therapy.         She is survived by her husband, Gabriel; a son, Jeffrey, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Jan Doughery of Sedona, Ariz; a brother, Martin Whitman of New York City; a sister, Judge Phyllis Beck of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.       
         Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.         She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said.         Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.         She started as a financial aide in the Ossining urban renewal agency, then worked for the New York City Office of Management and Budget. She became director of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program in Fairfield County, Conn., then was appointed the Private Industry Council's deputy director for southern Connecticut. She joined the Yonkers control board as deputy director.         Mrs. Brewster helped found Job's Refuge, a homeless shelter in Ossining.  She served on the board of the Open Door Family Health Clinic in Ossining, was a deacon for Briarcliff Congregational Church and was president of the Inter-Faith Council for Action, a housing preservation organization.         Surviving are her husband of eight years; their daughter, Catherine Eisenmann; her mother, Barbara Brewster of Ossining; and three sisters, Deborah Ferrenz of Silver Spring, Md., Abigail McGahey of Tyngsboro, Mass., and Alison Henderson of North Andover, Mass.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Susan Jenkins Kinnear, a former director of the Garden Club of America, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Ala. She was 94 years old and lived in Birmingham.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Polly Lincoln.         Mrs. Kinnear was a horticultural and artistic judge and a director of the Garden Club of America from 1977 to 1979, when she received the club's Zone Horticultural Award. A native of Butler, Pa., she graduated from Allegheny College in 1920.         Mrs. Kinnear's husband, James W. Kinnear Jr., a vice president of United States Steel, now the USX Corporation, died in 1990. She is survived by two sons, James W. 3d, of Greenwich, Conn., president and chief executive officer of Texaco Inc., and Peter, of Birmingham; a daughter, Polly Lincoln of West Hartford, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Judge Frances Williamson Lehrich, a lawyer and former New York City magistrate, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Jacqueline L. Becker of Boca Raton, Fla.         Judge Lehrich, who was born in Brooklyn, forged a distinguished legal career at a time when such opportunities were all but closed to women.         A graduate of Girls High School in Brooklyn and Barnard College, Judge Lehrich attended Yale Law School, where she was the first woman to become a member of the Yale Law Journal. She graduated from Yale in 1922 and joined the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.         In 1935, she was appointed an assistant corporation counsel of New York City during the term of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. In 1938 he appointed her secretary to the Board of Estimate and, in 1941, to a 10-year term as a City Magistrate. Judge Lehrich was the third woman in the city's history to be appointed to the bench.         After leaving the bench in 1951, Judge Lehrich continued to practice law and to be active in civic affairs. During the 1960's and 1970's she was a member and chairman of the Arbitration Association of America.         Judge Lehrich's husband, Henry, a lawyer, died in 1966.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a grandson, a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.
