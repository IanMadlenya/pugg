         Mildred Finger Haines, who helped shape fashion tastes for four decades as a top buyer for department stores and a consultant to clothes makers and retailers, died on Saturday. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was a heart attack, family members said.         From the late 1940's through the late 1960's, Mrs. Haines, known throughout her career as Mildred Finger, was a buyer of ready-to-wear at Macy's, Ohrbach's and Bergdorf Goodman, and one of New York City's most often cited taste makers. At Bergdorf's, in particular, she was noted for bringing European styles to American consumers.         She later became vice president of Charles of the Ritz, headed fashion merchandising for Yves St.Laurent and became an independent consultant, with clients like the Limited and Arthur D. Little.         Suffering from multiple sclerosis, she retired in 1986. In succeeding years, she frequently contributed her knowledge of the fashion industry to the oral history projects of the American Jewish Committee and the Fashion Institute of Technology.         Mrs. Haines is survived by her husband, Robert; two sons, Matthew and Daniel, both of Manhattan; a sister, Bella Finger Kleinman of the Bronx; a daughter-in-law, Francine Kane of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Jean Muir, the British fashion classicist whose design career spanned more than 30 years, died on Sunday in London at the London Clinic. She was 66.         She died of breast cancer, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.         Often referred to as the doyenne of British fashion, Miss Muir, as she insisted everyone call her, designed starkly simple clothes that were timeless and elegant. A perfectionist who tried on everything she designed, she was best known for matte jersey dresses, supple suedes, featherlight punched leathers and cashmere sweaters.         She considered herself a dressmaker first and foremost, yet employed tailoring techniques to achieve the controlled flow of fabric that gave her jersey dresses their signature fit. The shoulders were small, the waist slightly raised and the skirt fluid. It was a shape that particularly suited her petite figure. The dresses were nearly always in the somber black and navy blue she preferred and wore almost exclusively.         Miss Muir developed a personal style that changed very little. For most of her life, her reddish brown hair was cut into a straight bob, her face was chalky white and her lipstick the color of black currants. Her London apartment was entirely white, down to the white rubber flooring. She was frequently quoted as saying, "When you find something that suits you and never lets you down, why not stick with it?" It was a statement that applied equally well to herself and to the clothes she designed, which were instantly identifiable as Jean Muirs and never followed the vagaries of fashion.         "Jean was unique and original and irreplaceable," said Geraldine Stutz, the former president and owner of Henri Bendel in New York, which carried Miss Muir's clothing from the early 60's until the late 80's. The clothes can now be found at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Linda Dresner.         "You can say unique and irreplaceable," Ms. Stutz added, "but in Jean's case it is literally and historically true. For years, other designers tried to copy the Jean Muir look and failed. The only ones who didn't try were the French, who called her 'la reine de la robe,' the dress queen."         Yet, Miss Muir never had formal design training. Born in London and of Scottish descent, she attended boarding school in Bedfordshire, where she was taught sewing and knitting. At 11 she started to make clothes for herself and at 19 went to work in the stockroom at Liberty, the London store. She eventually became a sketcher in the store's made-to-measure department, and she went to Jaeger as a designer in 1956.         In 1962, she became the designer for Jane & Jane, a company of young Londoners who, along with designers like Mary Quant, helped to shake up the staid British fashion world. That was when she caught the eye of Jean Rosenberg, the foresighted buyer who brought her to Bendel's.         In 1966, she formed Jean Muir Ltd. in partnership with her husband, Harry Lueckert, a former German actor she had married in 1955. In her own business she was able to develop the style of clothing that appealed to women as diverse as Princess Alexandra, Lady Antonia Fraser, Glenda Jackson, Lauren Bacall and Joanna Lumley, the co-star of the British comedy "Absolutely Fabulous," who once worked as a Jean Muir model.         She won many fashion awards, including election to the British Fashion Awards Hall of Fame last year, and was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1984. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1973. She served on the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1979 to 1983 and became a trustee the next year.         Miss Muir, who had no children, is survived by her husband. She will be buried at Lorbottle, her estate in Northumberland, 15 miles from the Scottish border. A memorial service will be held at a later date.       
         Ermina Stimson, an illustrator, art director and fashion editor during 36 years with Women's Wear Daily, died on Tuesday at her home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 93.         Ms. Stimson, who began her career at Women's Wear Daily as an illustrator in 1930, was appointed fashion editor in 1960, a job she held for six years before retiring.         She was born in Stratford, Conn., and graduated from Smith College in 1923. She then moved to Paris, where she worked for several fashion publications.         Her first husband, George Kinnell, died in 1937. Her second, Capt. Joseph Goble of the Royal Navy, was killed in World War II. She is survived by her son, George Kinnell of Canyon, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Beryl Jackson of Avon, England, and a grandson.       
         Carol Fox Sulzberger, the wife of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, and an active volunteer with foundations and social-service organizations, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, L.I. She was 68.         The cause of her death was cancer.         Mrs. Sulzberger was a director of the New York City Police Foundation. At one time, she also served on the boards of the National Urban League, the New York Urban League, WAIF/International Social Service, the Girl Scouts of Greater New York and the Cooperative Education Association.         "She carried a very heavy schedule without talking a lot about it," a friend, Margaret Greenfield, said yesterday. "She did a lot of good works in a very quiet way."         Mrs. Greenfield and another friend of many years, Sydney Gruson, said friends would remember Mrs. Sulzberger as a woman who jealously guarded the time she spent with her family, her antiques hunting and her passion for the company and conversation of intimates. "She had a wry sense of humor," Mr. Gruson said. "And she was the most direct, honest woman I have ever known."         An avid reader of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger especially championed its coverage of fashion and the arts.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Estelle and David Fox. Mr. Fox had been president of Jay Thorpe, a New York women's specialty store that has since closed.         Educated at the Dalton School, she was a graduate of Goddard College in Vermont. In her youth, she spent a number of years with her family in Paris.         In addition to her husband of 39 years, she is survived by two daughters, Cathy, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Cynthia, of New York City, and two stepchildren, Karen, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Arthur Jr., the publisher of The Times, and seven grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family said that in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the New York City Police Foundation at 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10105.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Adele Simpson, an important player in the postwar fashion movement, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 91.         Mrs. Simpson took French couture and gave it an American ready-to-wear interpretation. Her color-coordinated dresses and jackets and well-cut coats in fine fabrics found favor among well-heeled women of her time in search of classic clothes that did not cost a month's rent.         Mrs. Simpson's popularity spanned more than three decades, from the late 1940's through the 1970's. Her coming of age as a designer mirrored the development of American sportswear, which was defining itself and growing in importance as the mass-market technology that followed World War II left its mark on fashion.         Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon and Barbara Bush were among those who wore her designs, and her collections were available in some of the nation's finest stores, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and Saks Fifth Avenue.         "She made clothes for ladies," said Helen O'Hagan, a fashion publicist who once worked at Saks. "They were beautifully made and designed. It wasn't advanced, but that wasn't who she was after."         Mrs. Simpson was born Adele Smithline in New York City, the fifth daughter of Latvian immigrants. In 1927, she married Wesley Simpson, a textile executive.         At 21, after completing design studies at Pratt Institute, she replaced her older sister Anna as head designer for Ben Girshel, then an important Seventh Avenue manufacturer. A few years later, she went to work for Mary Lee, another Seventh Avenue manufacturer. In 1949, she bought the company and renamed it Adele Simpson.         As was the practice of the day, she traveled regularly to Paris to gather inspiration and copy French designs.         Mrs. Simpson was the recipient of numerous fashion accolades, including the Coty American Fashion Critics award in 1947.         For the wedding of President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci, in 1966, Mrs. Simpson designed for the mother of the bride a wrinkle-resistant yellow silk street-length coat, matching princess-line dress and hat. This ensemble, with it color coordination and clean, practical lines, was typical of Mrs. Simpson's concept of fashion.         She continued designing into her 70's, retiring in 1985. Her daughter, Joan Raines, and son-in-law, Richard Raines, ran the business after her retirement. In 1991, the family sold the business to Barron Peters, a clothing company in Lowell, Mass., which has since filed for bankruptcy and discontinued the Adele Simpson line.         Mrs. Simpson's husband died in 1976.         In addition to her daughter, Joan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Simpson is survived by a son, Jeffrey, also of Manhattan, and three grandsons.       
         Pamela Ann Shaw, who used her battle with AIDS to warn young people about the risks of unprotected sex, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 31  and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was AIDS-related lymphoma, her family said.         As a board member of Love Heals, the Alison Gertz Foundation for AIDS Education, she spoke to teen-agers across the country at forums and in classrooms. In May 1994, she received an "Extraordinary Voices" award from Mothers' Voices, a national AIDS awareness and advocacy organization. She also represented Mothers' Voices in Washington, where she met with members of Congress and President Clinton.         At the time of her diagnosis in 1991, Ms. Shaw was a fashion coordinator for  Polo Ralph Lauren. In 1993, she left her job to devote herself to speaking about AIDS. She also worked as a volunteer with Friends Indeed, a New York organization for people with AIDS.         Ms. Shaw graduated from Hunter College, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications. She is survived by her father, Donald H. Shaw, and stepmother, Carol Henning Shaw; her mother, Marijane Shaw, and her sisters, Victoria and Donaly, all of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Jeakins, who won three Academy Awards for costume design while collaborating with directors like John Huston and Victor Fleming and stars like  Ingrid Bergman and Ava Gardner, died on Nov. 21 at a nursing home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 81 and lived in Montecito, Calif.         In the course of a long career, Ms. Jeakins designed costumes for films including "Samson and Delilah," "The Night of the Iguana," "The Sound of Music," "The Way We Were," "The Misfits," "Reflections in a Golden Eye," "The Ten Commandments," "The Greatest Show on Earth," "The Music Man," "Elmer Gantry" and "Catch-22."         Besides winning three Oscars, she was nominated 12 times for Academy Awards. Her honors were all the more unusual because unlike such better-known designers  as Edith Head, who supervised all of Paramount's movies for decades, Ms. Jeakins was never on the payroll of a major studio for more than one movie at a time.         In addition to Huston, with whom she made six movies, and Fleming, whose "Joan of Arc" brought her the first Academy Award for costume design, in her first major work on a film, Ms. Jeakins worked with such directors as Cecil B. DeMille, Martin Ritt, Robert Wise and William Wyler.         "I was always a director's designer more than an actor's designer," she said  as she reflected on her career a few years ago. "My work was literary."         "What concerns me most is the canvas," she said. "The canvas is the script, and the designer is the painter. What colors do you put on the canvas and why?"         (She said the only fan letter she ever received from an actor came from Sean  Connery, after she dressed him for "The Molly Maguires," a 1970 film about a secret society of Irish mine workers in 19th-century Pennsylvania. "Your clothes made me feel like a coal miner," he wrote.)         Besides her Academy Award for the 1948 release "Joan of Arc," with Bergman and Jose Ferrer, Ms. Jeakins won Oscars for DeMille's "Samson and Delilah" (1948), with Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr, and Huston's "Night of the Iguana,"  (1964), with Richard Burton, Gardner and Deborah Kerr.         Ms. Jeakins's work was not confined to Hollywood. In New York, she designed for stage productions including "South Pacific," "Affairs of State," "King Lear" (with Louis Calhern), "Too Late the Phalarope," "Major Barbara," "Winesburg, Ohio" and "The World of Suzie Wong." For television, she costumed Mary Martin in "Annie Get Your Gun" and Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer in "Mayerling."         Ms. Jeakins was curator of textiles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from 1967 to 1970. She went to Japan on a Guggenheim fellowship in 1961 to study traditional Japanese costume in Noh drama, and created pencil drawings, textile collages and watercolors that were exhibited in galleries and museums.         To all practical purposes she retired about five years ago, after serving as  adviser to the costume department at Santa Barbara City College, her son Peter Dane said.         Ms. Jeakins was born on Jan. 11, 1914 in San Diego. When she was 5, she said  in 1988, her father, who wore expensive clothes and lived in cheap apartments, took her from her mother and hid her in a series of foster homes.         "To this hour I don't know what happened to my mother," Ms. Jeakins said. "She was a couture dresser. She made tea gowns."         Ms. Jeakins grew up in Los Angeles and won a scholarship to the Otis Art Institute. Like many other artists, she was employed during the Depression by the Work Projects Administration. For a time she worked for Walt Disney Studios  drawing Mickey Mouse. Later she drew fashion designs for the I.  Magnin department store, an assignment that caught the eye of Richard Dey, a motion picture art director, who introduced her to Fleming.         Fleming hired the gawky, painfully shy Ms. Jeakins in 1947 as a sketch artist for "Joan of Arc," his film adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's play. Most costume  artists need sketch artists to transfer their ideas to paper. On the Fourth of July weekend, Ms. Jeakins recalled, "My life was altered in an instant."         Fleming, whose manner was considered rough and terrifying, dismissed his designer, Karinska, and insisted that Ms. Jeakins create the costumes for "Joan  of Arc."         To experts, the Jeakins touch was unmistakable. The producer and director John Houseman, for whom she designed on Broadway and at the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., said he knew after five minutes of watching Huston's final  film, "The Dead," in 1988, that Ms. Jeakins was the costume designer.         "It was in the way she adapts to the characters," Houseman said then. "She very seldom tries to impose her own quirks or ideas on the actors. She works for the script rather than the flash."         "The costumes in 'The Dead' have no crimson, no blue, no green no violet," Ms. Jeakins said of her work on the film adaptation of James Joyce's short story. "I used mud colors -- olive, nutmeg, clove, persimmon, faded red -- the colors of real life, to get the kind of oppressive quality in Dublin social life. They conveyed lamplight and the dour color of a Dublin house."         Summing up her work, Ms. Jeakins once said: "In the middle of the night, I can put my world down to two words: 'Make beauty.' It's my cue and my private passion."         A marriage in 1940 to Raymond Eugene Dane, a publicity director for 20th Century Fox, ended in divorce in 1946.         In addition to her son Peter Dane, of Las Vegas, she is survived by another son, Stephen Dane of Los Angeles, and a half-brother, Allan Willet of Carlsbad,  Calif.       
         Vera Maxwell, one of a legendary group of American sportswear designers who came to prominence in the 1940's, died on Sunday in Rincon, P.R., at the home of her grandson, Douglas Maxwell.         She was 93 and died after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Rhea Maxwell.         One of the pioneers of women's sportswear along with Claire McCardell, Clare Potter, Carolyn Schnurer and Tina Leser, Vera Maxwell continued to design clothes that were casual, comfortable and classic until her retirement in 1985.         Among her innovations was the "weekend wardrobe" of 1935 that consisted of two jackets, two skirts and a pair of trousers; the wraparound jersey blouse; the riding jacket suit and the fencing suit. In the 1940's she designed a cotton coverall uniform for war workers at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation that was a forerunner of the jump suit. She was also the first American designer to make clothes of Ultrasuede.         She won the Coty American Fashion Critics' Award in 1953 and was honored in 1970 with a retrospective exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. In 1980 there was another retrospective, this time at the Museum of the City of New York, which opened with a party attended by Princess Grace of Monaco and her daughter Princess Caroline. Mrs. Maxwell had met the former Grace Kelly in Dallas in 1955 when they were both there to receive Neiman Marcus Awards, and she frequently visited her and Prince Rainier in Monaco.         Born Vera Huppe in New York City on April 22, 1901, of Viennese parents, she traveled to Europe with them as a child and lived for a while in Vienna. She attended high school in Leonia, N.J., and studied ballet in New York, becoming a member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1919. She danced with the company until her marriage in 1924 to Raymond J. Maxwell, who worked on Wall Street. They were divorced in 1937. She married Carlisle H. Johnson, an architect, in 1938 and divorced him in 1945.         While married to Mr. Maxwell, she had started to model on Seventh Avenue and developed an interest in making clothes. She studied tailoring in London and worked as a designer for several American sportswear houses including Adler and Adler, Glenhunt and Max Milstein. (In 1970, Mrs. Maxwell formed a business partnership with Mr. Milstein's nephew Morton Milstein.)         Mrs. Maxwell became known as a designer in the 1930's when American fashion was struggling to be born and most designers toiled anonymously. She achieved fame with such designs as a weekend wardrobe of a collarless jacket with four patch pockets that she made in tweed and in gray flannel to be mixed and matched with a short pleated flannel tennis skirt, a longer tweed skirt with pressed-down pleats and a pair of flannel cuffed trousers -- all designs so classic they could still be worn today.         Following the precepts of her idol, Coco Chanel, Mrs. Maxwell devoted herself to making timeless clothes that women could move around in. In 1975, she showed what she called a "speed suit," which was actually a pull-on dress with a stretch top and no zippers, buttons, snaps or ties. A woman could slip it on in seconds.         After years of designing for other manufacturers, Mrs. Maxwell founded her own company, Vera Maxwell Originals, in 1947. Her heyday was in the 1950's when her easy-to-wear styles attracted customers like Pat Nixon, Martha Graham and Lillian Gish. By 1960 her clothes were being sold in 700 stores around the country. In the 60's, her star waned as fashion's attention shifted to swinging London designers like Mary Quant and Zandra Rhodes.         In 1964, Mrs. Maxwell showed a collection of American Indian-inspired clothing that failed to find an audience. "It bombed," she said in an interview that appeared in The New York Times in 1970. "So I decided to lie fallow for a while."         She resurfaced in 1970 with a collection that was introduced at a tea in B. Altman's. Until her retirement, she continued to turn out the tasteful classic suits, coats and dresses that her loyal customers would wear for years.         She made a brief comeback as a consultant to a knitwear company but spent most of her time working on her memoirs. They have never been published, her daughter-in-law said, partly because "people wanted gossip about Grace Kelly, but she wouldn't write that."         She sold her Manhattan apartment three years ago and retired to Gilgo Beach, L.I., with her son, Dr. R. John Maxwell, and daughter-in-law and spent winters in Rincon with them and her grandson. She is also survived by her granddaughter, Sarah Maxwell of Santa Fe, N.M., and a great-granddaughter, Isabel Maxwell.       
         Nina Leen, one of the first female photographers for Life magazine, died on Sunday at her home in New York City. Ms. Leen was secretive about her age, but Alison Hart, a press agent for Life, said she was believed to be in her late 70's or early 80's.         Ms. Leen photographed many subjects but was best known for her pictures of animals. Among her 15 books were two studies of bats, published in the 1970's. To make the pictures for these books, she used special cameras and lighting and overcame an aversion to the animals.         One of her most famous images is a 1950 photograph of the Abstract Expressionist artists known as the Irascibles, including Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and Jackson Pollock.         Ms. Leen was married for many years to Serge Balkin, a fashion photographer. No immediate family members survive.       
         Evelyn Tripp, a leading fashion model of the 1950's and 1960's, died on Monday in her home at Remsenburg, L.I. She was 67.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Stan Young.         Ms. Tripp was widely considered to be among the most versatile of a small group of models that exemplified the postwar American fashion industry's emphasis on glamour. Her dramatic features -- a high round forehead, prominent chin and broad cheekbones -- were recorded by dozens of noted photographers, among them, Horst P. Horst, Richard Avedon, Irwin Blumenfeld, Karen Radkai and Lillian Bassman.         Ms. Tripp was a favorite subject of William Klein. His 1958 photograph of her, blowing cigarette smoke from beneath the veil of a beaded cocktail hat, appears on the cover of "William Klein: In and Out of Fashion" (Random House, 1994). It also serves as the signature image of an exhibition of the photographer's work that is currently at the International Center of Photography.         The daughter of a lead miner, Evelyn Tripp was born in 1927 on a small farm in Flat River, Mo. After being discovered at age 20 -- a clerical worker, she was shopping at a Fifth Avenue department store when spotted by an assistant to Louise Dahl-Wolfe, the celebrated Harper's Bazaar photographer -- Ms. Tripp soon began to appear frequently on magazine covers.         She appeared on more than 40 covers, beginning with the Jan. 1, 1949, issue of Vogue. She retired in 1968.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Sadie Tripp; a brother, David Tripp, both of Farmington, Mo., and two sisters, Kay Taylor of Dahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Karen Eaton of Topeka, Kan.       
         Adele Green, a co-founder of the Lawrence of London raincoat company, died on Friday at Bronx Lebanon Hospital after a brief illness. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan.         As the designer for Lawrence of London, which she founded with her first husband, Norman Lawrence, in the 1950's, Mrs. Green helped to bring rainwear into the fashion spectrum by offering water-repellent coats that could also be worn on sunny days and as evening wraps. At one time, she enlisted Valentino, the Italian couturier, to design a special collection for the company.         Mrs. Green was born in Boston and graduated from Wellesley College. She also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.         She left Lawrence of London in the late 1970's after being divorced from Mr. Lawrence. She then married Arthur Green, who died 10 years ago, and worked as a consultant to the rainwear industry.         Mrs. Green is survived by her daughter, Rochel Klein of Brooklyn; two sisters, Jacqueline Lowenthal and Allene Warzer, both of Freeport, N.Y., and six nieces and nephews.       
         Ginger Rogers, the vivacious actress whose supple grace in the arms of Fred Astaire lifted the spirits of Depression-era moviegoers in some of the most elegantly romantic musical films ever made, died yesterday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 83.         The blond, blue-eyed actress, who came out of Charleston contests and the vaudeville circuits to win notice as a cherub-faced flapper with a piping voice and a sassy air in early musicals like "42d Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933," went on to win acclaim for her dramatic portrayals and an Academy Award for best actress for her depiction of a lovelorn career woman in the 1940 film "Kitty Foyle."         The potent chemistry of her partnership with Astaire, in a succession of urbane romances that featured rapturous dance routines, propelled her into the top 10 of Hollywood's box-office attractions. "He gives her class, and she gives him sex," Katharine Hepburn once said. By 1941, Ginger Rogers was the highest-paid American woman, earning $355,000 a year.         While her graceful dancing was on display in her many musicals, Miss Rogers also won renown in dramatic roles including an aspiring actress in "Stage Door" (1937) and a prostitute's daughter in "Primrose Path" (1940). Her gift for comedy bubbled through movies like "Bachelor Mother" (1939), "Tom, Dick and Harry" (1941) and "The Major and the Minor" (1942). In a screen career that began with a bit role in "Young Man of Manhattan" in 1930, she made more than 70 movies.         But the Astaire-Rogers musicals, epitomizing grace, energy and sophistication, were her enduring memorial. The couple, in their smooth, seemingly effortless style, spun gossamer fantasies from the infectious scores of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Vincent Youmans.         Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, said yesterday: "Ginger Rogers was a better dancer than most people gave her credit for. She may have swooped and dipped into many a romantic swoon, but her footwork was as precise as Astaire's."         The plots of their films often turned on mistaken identity and other far-fetched devices, but they were accepted as breathing spaces between the couple's champagne dance numbers in lavish settings where all the walls, telephones and pianos were white, the butlers were always comic and love was the only concern.         Under Astaire's painstaking coaching, Miss Rogers's dancing became more fluid with each film, and the consensus was that none of his later partnerships generated the electricity they did.         Writing in 1972, the dance critic Arlene Croce said Miss Rogers "danced with love, with pride in the beauty of an illusion -- and with one of the most elegant dancer's bodies imaginable." She added, "She avoided any suggestion of toil or inadequacy."         When the actress went to the stage of the Biltmore Bowl in the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles to accept her Oscar on Feb. 27, 1941, she stood with tears streaming down her face and said: "This is the greatest moment of my life. I want to thank the one who has stood by me faithfully: my mother."         It was her mother, the former Lela Owens, who groomed her for a show-business career with singing, dancing and acting lessons. Miss Rogers, whose given name was Virginia Katherine McMath, was born on July 16, 1911, in Independence, Mo. Her father, William McMath, and her mother were divorced soon after. Their daughter was called Ginger because a cousin could not pronounce Virginia, and she took her later surname from John Rogers, who was briefly her stepfather. She grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and Fort Worth. Her mother continued to manage her career until she died in 1977.         At 15, Miss Rogers became the champion Charleston dancer in Texas. Then, for three years, her mother chaperoned her through four vaudeville acts a day throughout the South and Midwest. "I traveled with my mother, Lela, and there was never enough money," Miss Rogers said. "I always had to roll down my silk stockings and carry a doll when we bought train tickets so I could go half-fare. If we had $3, we always figured how to tip for the trunks and still eat." She played Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago. When Miss Rogers was 18, they went to New York, where she sang with two bands and in a musical and starred in the Gershwins' 1930 Broadway hit "Girl Crazy," introducing the songs "But Not for Me" and "Embraceable You."         At 19, she made her first feature film in New York, "Young Man of Manhattan," uttering a memorable instruction: "Cigarette me, big boy." In her third musical film, "42d Street," she was a risque, wisecracking chorine, Anytime Annie. "The only time she said no," a fellow actor quipped, "she didn't hear the question."         Her big break came when she was 22, when she and Mr. Astaire won supporting roles in "Flying Down to Rio." Their rollicking introduction of a dance called the Carioca stole the show from its nominal stars, Dolores Del Rio and Gene Raymond.         Over the next six years they were teamed in eight more movies and introduced a glittering array of now-standard songs and dances, among them "Night and Day" and "The Continental" from "The Gay Divorcee," "I Won't Dance" from "Roberta," "Cheek to Cheek" from "Top Hat," "Let's Face the Music and Dance" from "Follow the Fleet," "Never Gonna Dance" from "Swing Time" and "They All Laughed" from "Shall We Dance."         Years later, she wrote about their partnership, emphasizing that Astaire was no Svengali. By the time they joined forces in "Flying Down to Rio" in 1933, she pointed out, she had made 20 films, he only one. She acknowledged that they had "occasional snits," but, she said: "We had fun, and it shows. True, we were never bosom buddies off the screen; we were different people with different interests. We were a couple only on film."         And, she noted: "I'd do three or four pictures between those I made with Fred. We weren't Siamese twins. I always wanted to stretch out and do some things as me, alone, by myself. I did, and among the things was 'Kitty Foyle.' "         Miss Rogers's later films included an elaborate fantasy, "Lady in the Dark" (1944); a wartime romance, "I'll Be Seeing You" (1945); the comedies "Dreamboat" (1952), "Monkey Business" (1952) and "Forever Female" (1954), and melodramas like "Tight Spot" (1955) and "Harlow" (1965). Reviewers attributed her enduring success to a dualistic personality -- tough versus vulnerable, ingenuous versus calculating -- and to a talent for mimicry and pretense.         In 1951, Miss Rogers won wide praise in a Broadway comedy, "Love and Let Love," although reviewers panned the play. Typically, she concluded, "We could have gone on touring around the country, probably playing to packed houses and getting our money back, but I'd rather be a sitting duck in a big pond."         In later musical triumphs, she succeeded Carol Channing in the title role of "Hello, Dolly!" on Broadway in 1965 and played the role to ovations for more than two years. In 1969, she introduced "Mame" to London audiences. Gower Champion, who directed her in "Dolly," hailed her "drive, verve, spark and talent."         Miss Rogers liked to keep busy. She often worked in summer stock, appearing in productions of musicals like "Annie Get Your Gun" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and in comedies like "Tovarich" and "Bell, Book and Candle." In the 1970's she developed a successful nightclub act, and she was also a fashion consultant to the J. C. Penney chain.         In her last film, in 1965, she played Jean Harlow's mother in "Harlow." By then, she was unhappy with the frankness of Hollywood films. Looking back, she said, "We made happy pictures that people enjoyed seeing, not the kind the audiences have to go through trauma to see nowadays."         Miss Rogers's autobiography, "Ginger: My Story," was published by HarperCollins in 1991. John Mueller, in The New York Times Book Review, found Miss Rogers's book short on insight and discreet to the point that "one does not get a terribly rich feel for her personality." In discussing her career, he continued, "she is far more likely to tell us what she wore than what she did."         Miss Rogers was a Christian Scientist who never smoked or drank alcohol, except for an occasional glass of wine at supper. She loved the outdoors and exercised regularly. When her schedule allowed, she swam every day and played golf and tennis several times a week. She ate moderately and maintained a trim figure in middle age, giving this advice: "I try to feed my hunger rather than my appetite."         In 1938, she built a mountaintop mansion in Beverly Hills with a large swimming pool, a tennis court and an elaborate soda fountain. She also bought a big dairy and multi-crop ranch on the Rogue River near Medford, Ore., which eventually became her main home.         The actress was married five times: to Edward Culpepper, a dancer and actor known in vaudeville as Jack Pepper (1928 to 1931); the actor Lew Ayres (1934 to 1940); Jack Briggs, another actor (1943 to 1949); Jacques Bergerac, a French actor and businessman (1953 to 1957), and William Marshall, a director and producer (1961-1967). All five marriages ended in divorce. "I yearned for a long, happy marriage with one person," she wrote. But, she said, her life had been blessed in other ways, and in 1987 she said she didn't mind being alone. "It'd be fun to have a chum around, but it's very had to have a chum unless you're married to him," she said. "And I don't believe in today's concept for living with someone unmarried."         In 1992, Miss Rogers was one of the recipients of the 15th annual Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement.         Asked by one interviewer what personal quality she was proudest of, Miss Rogers replied: "The most important thing in anyone's life is to be giving something. The quality I can give is fun and joy and happiness. This is my gift." Ever a Trouper Through the Decades         In more than six decades in show business, Ginger Rogers appeared in some 70 films, as well as in vaudeville, theater and television.

         Holly Harp, the California designer who went from a Sunset Boulevard sensation to a darling of Fifth Avenue salons, died on Monday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 55.         The cause of death was cancer, said her fiance, Mark Buchman.         Mrs. Harp, who captivated Hollywood with a rich hippie look in the 1960's and enthralled New York with soft clinging designs, was nominated for Coty awards two times.         But Mr. Buchman said on Friday in reporting her death that Mrs. Harp once described herself as a "counterculturalist," an apt description for a woman who began her career translating the clothes of the flower children into fashion for counterculture heroines.         When rock stars like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick began exchanging jeans for Mrs. Harp's fringed vests and tie-dyed velvet dresses, the Holly's Harp shop that she opened on Sunset Boulevard in 1968 became the center of a new style.         Her husband at the time, Jim, described the fashions, which included painted jersey, silk and chiffon dresses, and hip-hugger bell bottoms made from old draperies, as "somewhere between here and Mars."         Mrs. Harp came down to earth a bit after 1973, when she began selling to Fifth Avenue stores like Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman, whose fourth-floor Holly Harp shop showed her latest collection of $1,500 evening dresses three weeks ago.         But for all their initial counterculture flamboyance, the designs from the beginning included soft flowing chiffon dresses. Mrs. Harp had a disarming explanation for how she achieved that soft romantic look. "I took the construction out," she said.         For all the comparative elegance of her sensuous body-hugging evening dresses, Mrs. Harp's designs always had an edge, sometimes literally. In 1977, when one bright red creation reminded her of a flame, she proceeded to enhance the effect, taking a blowtorch and charring the garment's edges.         "I'm not trying to do tasteful little uniforms," she said in 1988. "Being dressed in perfect taste is very aging."         Mrs. Harp, a size 6 who designed for her own 5-foot-4-inch frame, had no patience for the presumed restrictions of age. As she put it when she appeared at an interview at the age of 47 wearing a short lame dress with glitter hose: "I still have a sexy little girl in me that won't quit."         Mrs. Harp was born in Buffalo and studied design at North Texas State University, where she met and married Mr. Harp, an English instructor. Her boutique became such a success that he abandoned his academic career. They divorced in 1980, but remained business partners.         Surviving are a son, Tom, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Sarah Bozzola of Orange, Conn., and Elizabeth Horn of Buffalo, and a brother, Thomas Speller of Buffalo.
