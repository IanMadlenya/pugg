         Billie Dove, one of the most beautiful stars of silent films, died on Dec. 31 in the hospital of the Motion Picture and Television Fund in Los Angeles. She was 97 and lived in the fund's retirement community.         A former Ziegfeld Follies dancer, she played a leading role in dozens of  silents and also had a brief Hollywood career in the early days of sound movies. Often she was cast as a damsel in distress, confidently awaiting rescue at the last minute by actors like Douglas Fairbanks, with whom she starred in ''The Black Pirate'' in 1926. After playing the title role in ''American Beauty'' the following year, she was billed as The American Beauty.         Playing opposite everyone from Basil Rathbone to Eddie Cantor and Clara Bow, Miss Dove acted in a broad range of films: costume epics, war movies, westerns, romantic comedies. She was a Romanov princess in ''Adoration,'' a murderous chorus girl in ''One Night at Susie's,'' a French actress in ''Cock of the Air'' (produced by Howard Hughes and written by Robert E. Sherwood and Charles Lederer) and a Follies girl in ''Blondie of the Follies.''         One role she did not get was in Frederick Lewis Allen's ''Only Yesterday.'' She had been considered, along with Gloria Stuart (currently featured in the movie ''Titanic''), but both were rejected in favor of Margaret Sullavan, then a New York stage actress.         Miss Dove was born in New York City. Her name was Lillian Bohny, but she was known as Billie to her classmates. When a photographer told her she looked like a dove, she remembered the description and later adopted it as her professional surname. From the age of 10 she was a model. Florenz Ziegfeld reportedly saw her picture on a billboard advertisement and discovered her for his theatrical revues.         In 1921, she entered the movies, beginning with ''Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford'' and ''At the Stage Door.'' ''The Black Pirate'' was a turning point in her career, and was followed by ''The Stolen Bride,'' ''The Tender Hour,'' ''The Love Mart,'' ''The Yellow Lily,'' ''The Night Watch'' and more than 30 others. In her private life, she was a pilot, a painter and a poet.         Her first husband was Irving Willat, a film director. They were divorced in 1930. Three years later, she married Robert Kenaston, a rancher, and retired from films. After Mr. Kenaston died in 1973, she married John Miller, an architect. She and Mr. Miller were later divorced. In 1962, she returned to the screen in a bit part in ''Diamond Head.''         She is survived by a daughter, Gail Adelson of Los Angeles, and a grandson.       
         Hansel Mieth Hagel, a photographer who documented the Great Depression and World War II for Time, Fortune and Life magazines, died on Feb. 14 at a friend's home in Santa Rosa, Calif. She was 88 and lived on a ranch nearby.         She was known professionally as Hansel Mieth, and she left a lasting impression in 1939 with a picture of a rhesus monkey rising from the waters of the Caribbean. It appeared on the cover of Life and remains one of the magazine's most often requested images.         In the 1950's, she and her husband, Otto Hagel, also a photographer, refused to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee and were blacklisted. As a result, their freelance assignments dried up and they turned to raising cattle.         Ms. Mieth's photographs are in the collection of the Library of Congress and others around the country.         A retrospective of the work of her and her husband is planned next year at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.         Otto Hagel died in 1973. No immediate relatives survive.       
         Countess Anthony Szapary, the doyenne of Newport society and the great-great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt who lived a good part of the year on the upper floors of  the Breakers, maintaining the family's presence in the 70-room mansion built by her grandparents, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 79.         The Countess had suffered a stroke at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., her family said.         The former Sylvia Anita Gabriel Denise Irene Marie Szechenyi (pronounced sa-CHAIN-ee) was one of five daughters of Count Lazlo Szechenyi and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt Szechenyi. Her father was the first minister from Hungary to the United States and later served at the Court of St. James. Her mother was the daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d, who built the Breakers as the family's summer home.         The house, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and covering more than an acre of the 11-acre estate, was modeled after Renaissance palaces in Turin and Genoa, and was finished in 1895. The mansion, which, with furnishings costing $7 million, was one of the Gilded Age estates referred to by their owners at the time as cottages.         The Breakers was maintained as a private residence until 1947 when it was leased to the Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 a year. The maintenance and the taxes were paid by Countess Szechenyi until her death in 1965. The society bought the property in 1972, but Countess Szapary (pronounced sa-PAR-ee) continued to live in rooms on the third floor, and her devotion to the Breakers endured to the end of her life, officials of the society said yesterday. The original furnishings were not included in the sale of the property, but over the years Countess Szechenyi's descendants gave most of them to the society.         Countess Szapary, who was known as Syvie to her friends, was a lively woman with strong opinions, an impish sense of humor and an adventurous spirit. As a child, she used a large silver tray to toboggan down the impressive staircase at the Breakers, a tradition that younger members of the Vanderbilt family are said to have carried on. She also rode her bicycle at breakneck speed around the great hall, and during World War II, when the house was shuttered, she maintained, tongue in cheek, that she kept America safe through her volunteer work as a plane spotter on the roof of a boys school in Newport.         In her later years, after the Breakers was opened to tourists (who were always called guests, at her insistence), she would occasionally join the tour group, casually dressed, her identity unknown, and correct the guides if she believed they had made a mistake.         Born in Remete, in Austria-Hungary, on Oct. 9, 1918, the Countess attended the Potomac School in Washington, Miss Faunce's School in London and the Chateau Brilliantmont in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1949, she married Count Anthony Szapary, a founder of the Hungarian National Sports Federation. Earlier, during World War II, he had been sent to a concentration camp for activities with the Hungarian Red Cross and his relief work for Polish and Jewish refugees. He was released through the intervention of King Gustav V of Sweden and came to the United States in 1947, becoming an adviser to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. He died in 1972.         The Countess is survived by a son, Paul, and a daughter, Gladys Szapary, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Countess Ferdinandine Eltz of Salzburg, Austria.         Countess Szapary was a former president of the Rhode Island Arts Foundation at Newport and was actively involved in the Newport Preservation Society. She was an organizer of the Newport Coaching weekends and aided several charities. She enjoyed both giving and going to parties and, as an avid amateur photographer, almost always had a small camera slung around her neck at the many social occasions in which she took part. She was known among her friends for the small albums of photographs that she often sent to other celebrators.         Countess Szapary was chairwoman of the 1995 centennial celebration of the Breakers, for which she created, in the stables of the estate, ''New York Central With the Vanderbilts,'' a small-scale version of the New York Central Lines, founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The model was created using her own trains and has become a favorite display for the younger guests of the house.         Creating an image that has endured among preservationists as well as family members, the Countess appeared at the opening, immediately before the family ball was to begin, clad in a T-shirt with a New York Central logo, an engineer's cap and a bandaged foot.         ''She told me she had hurt it bungee jumping,'' said Alfred Vanderbilt Jr., a cousin.       
         Esther Bubley, a documentary photographer who was noted for her sober, no-frills portrayal of post-World War II middle America, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her niece, Jean Bubley.         In the late 1930's, Ms. Bubley was  drawn to the picture essays in Life magazine and to the photography project of the Farm Security Administration. She studied painting and photography at the Minneapolis School of Art, and in 1942 became a microfilmer of rare books at the National Archives in Washington. The next year she was transferred to the darkrooms of the Office of War Information, which was headed by Roy Stryker, former director of the farm photography project.         She photographed Washington during her spare time, producing images that, in their loneliness, mystery and sadness, predated Robert Frank's book, ''The Americans,'' by more than a decade. In a Hopperesque image from 1943, one of the many young women who had flocked to the nation's capital to work for the war effort is shown sitting by herself at the end of a long, polished table, her arms folded, a cigarette in one hand. Her face is spotlighted, a look of almost painful solitude etched on it. In a kind of companion image,  taken the same year, a soldier in a photography booth looks lost in gloomy thoughts.         That year, Stryker assigned Ms. Bubley to photograph the transportation services available to soldiers and their families. It was the beginning of a long association that she regarded as the most important in her career. Also through Stryker, she was assigned to documentary projects by various companies and  magazine editors.         Ms. Bubley moved to New York in the mid-1940's. In 1952, her work was included in a group show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that was part of a series titled ''Diogenes With a Camera'' (the other photographers in the exhibition were Edward Weston, Frederick Sommer, Harry Callahan, Eliot Porter and W. Eugene Smith). In 1955, three of Ms. Bubley's images of schoolgirls and young women appeared in the ''Family of Man'' exhibition at the Modern.         In the 1970's, Ms. Bubley embarked on a very different photographic project: macrophotography of plants. These images were compiled in a 1979 book, ''A Mysterious Presence: Macrophotography of Plants.'' In her luminous, extreme close-ups, the plants are sinuous abstractions or have the fantastical tactility of insects under a powerful magnifier. One image of air bubbles caught in a starburst of cornflower seed hairs is magically jewel-like.         Ms. Bubley's work appeared in  publications including Life, Look, Sports Illustrated, Ladies Home Journal, Harper's Bazaar, Time, Fortune and The New York Times Magazine. Before her death, she was preparing a book of her work, to be published next year by the Smithsonian Institution Press.         Her 1947 marriage to Edwin Locke, a writer, ended in divorce. She is survived by two sisters, Anita Greenspan of Bethesda, Md., and Claire Tepper of Falls Church, Va.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Ilse Bing, one of the few surviving members of the fabled group of avant-garde artists who gathered in Paris in the early 1930's and produced brilliantly unorthodox and inventive photography, died Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 98 and lived on the Upper West Side.         Susan Arthur Whitson, director of the Edwynn Houk Gallery, which represents her work, said that the gallery had hoped that Ms. Bing would attend the March 26 opening of a retrospective of her work titled ''Ilse Bing: Vision of a Century.'' She would have been 99 on March 23.         Born into an affluent bourgeois family in Frankfurt, Ms. Bing was trained in music and art. It was while she was pursuing a doctorate in art history and photographing buildings for her dissertation that she developed a passion for photography. In early 1929 she began to do picture essays for the weekly supplement of a Frankfurt newspaper, becoming one of the few women to work in photojournalism at the time.         She soon abandoned her studies to become an artist and decided to leave for Paris in the summer of 1929 after seeing an exhibition of photographs by the Paris-based Florence Henri, who had embraced New Photography, which was characterized by extreme close-ups, unusual angles, high and low vantage points, and the rendering of everyday objects and reflected surfaces as abstract geometric forms.         Paris in the 1920's and 30's was home to modernists like Henri, who saw photography as the medium to revolutionize visual language in everything from photojournalism and commercial advertising to fashion and book illustration. Working intuitively and with no regard for conventional composition or subject matter, these modern photographers were above all entranced by the new sensations of urban living.         The only professional photographer in Paris in the 30's to work exclusively with the Leica, Ms. Bing mastered the use of this small camera as well as darkroom techniques to show the subtleties of light and movement against the inky blacks of Paris at night. She favored the overhead shots and tilted angles of German Constructivists, but her photographs are often infused with the softer, more lyrical and humanistic qualities found in the work of many French photographers.         Like Andre Kertesz and Henri Cartier-Bresson, she caught the spare, lovely geometries in ordinary Parisian life. She photographed nighttime Paris, using available light and producing images that were studies of light and deep shadow. Accidentally in the darkroom, and independently of Man Ray, she discovered a way to solarize the negative instead of the print, giving the image black outlines created from the controlled use of light during printing. Her solarized images of street scenes, especially at night, are magical coaxings of many shades of gray out of darkness.         Ms. Bing worked for magazines like Vu, Arts et Metiers Graphiques and Le Monde Illustre. She did fashion assignments for Harper's Bazaar and Schiaparelli. Her photographs were regularly shown during the 30's at La Pleiade gallery in Paris, alongside the work of other members of the photographic avant-garde.         In 1936, she was included in the first modern photography exhibition held at the Louvre. The next year she was part of the landmark photography exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Ms. Bing's best-known photograph from this period is a strikingly original self-portrait. To create this fractured image, she photographed a mirrored image of herself -- one bent arm leaning against a table, a Leica on a tripod positioned in front of one eye -- with a side view of herself reflected in another mirror.         When Ms. Bing visited New York in 1936, she was offered a position on the fledgling photo magazine Life. But she turned down the offer because her future husband, Konrad Wolff, a pianist and musicologist, lived in Paris. They married in 1937. Both were German Jews and were interned briefly as enemy aliens by the Vichy Government in 1940, but both managed to get themselves freed. Later that year, they sailed for New York, where they remained for the rest of their lives. Mr. Wolff died in 1989. No immediate family members survive. A memorial service will be held at the National Arts Club at 15 Gramercy Park South on April 2 at 3 P.M.         In March 1993, Ms. Bing was awarded the first Gold Medal for photography by the National Arts Club in Manhattan. She told an interviewer from The New York Times that she had given up photography in 1959 because ''everything moves, nothing stays and I should not hold on.'' Ms. Bing next turned to poetry, creating what she called ''snapshots without a camera.'' She also made collages with old photographs and objects, and illustrated whimsical books on etymology and on numbers. And she groomed dogs for a living.         Ms. Bing was, Ms. Whitson said, ''very sharp, very funny and very active -- she took up the motorcycle when she was in her 70's.''       
         Linda Eastman McCartney, the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney and a photographer whose portraits of 1960's rock stars have become classics, died on Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the McCartneys were vacationing. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer that spread to her liver, said Geoff Baker, a family spokesman.         Besides her work as a photographer, Ms. McCartney performed as a keyboardist and backup singer in two of her husband's post-Beatles bands, Wings and the unnamed ensemble that toured in 1989 and 1993. She was a staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism and, starting in the late 1980's, she turned her passion for vegetarian cooking into an industry. She published two cookbooks, ''Linda McCartney's Home Cooking'' in 1989 and ''Linda's Kitchen'' in 1996, and in 1991 started a line of frozen vegetarian dinners.         As the wife of a musician who had long been a teen-age heartthrob and was the last Beatle to be married,  Ms. McCartney first attracted the ire of her husband's fans, and eventually the respect of many of them. When the McCartneys were married in London on March 12, 1969, hundreds of crying girls packed the sidewalk outside the Marylebone Register Office. Later, when she toured with Mr. McCartney, she took considerable criticism for her modest keyboard and vocal technique.         But the McCartneys' 29-year marriage was uncommonly steady by the standards of the celebrity world of which they were a part but from which they generally remained aloof, spending most of their time on a farm in West Sussex, England. They  never spent a night apart, except for the 10 days Mr. McCartney spent in a Tokyo jail after he was arrested for marijuana possession; indeed, their disinclination to be separated was part of Mr. McCartney's reason for having his wife in his touring band.         And Mr. McCartney, the composer of some of the rock era's most beautiful love songs, has consistently told interviewers that all his romantic  ballads written after 1968 were about Linda. Those songs include everything from ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' and ''The Lovely Linda'' on his first post-Beatles album, ''McCartney'' (1970), ''Long-Haired Lady'' on ''Ram'' (1971) and ''My Love'' on ''Red Rose Speedway'' (1973) to more recent songs like ''We Got Married'' and ''Figure of Eight'' on ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989) and ''Somedays'' on ''Flaming Pie'' (1997), his most recent studio album.         Mr. McCartney was not the first to compose a song about Ms. McCartney. Her father, Lee Eastman, was a prominent show business lawyer in New York and one of his clients, Jack Lawrence, wrote ''Linda'' for her in 1947 when she was 6. Buddy Clark had a hit with the song that year, and it was later recorded by Perry Como and Jan and Dean.         Ms. McCartney also wrote a few songs, including the reggae-style ''Seaside Woman,'' which she and Mr. McCartney released as a single in 1977 under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes, and ''The White-Coated Man,'' which she wrote with Carla Lane and released (also as Suzy and the Red Stripes) on an animal-rights charity disk, ''Animal Magnetism,'' in 1994.         She was born Linda Louise Eastman on September 24, 1941, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. As she often pointed out, without ever dispelling the assertion entirely, she was not related to the Eastmans of the Eastman-Kodak photography empire. In fact, her father had changed his name from Epstein.         She described growing up in artistic and materialistic surroundings, with a status-conscious mother and a father whose friends and clients included the artist Willem de Kooning and the songwriters Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Arlen.         Ms. McCartney attended Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Arizona. While a student in Arizona, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in 1963.         Soon afterward, she took up photography, and in 1965 she returned to New York, where she began photographing rock groups, starting with the Dave Clark Five and the Rolling Stones. During the next few years she befriended and photographed dozens of rock stars, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Animals, Janis Joplin, the Mamas and the Papas, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead. A widely reproduced picture of the Beatles that she took at a press party for the release of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967 captured the group on the eve of its greatest artistic triumph.         Her photographs appeared in Rolling Stone and other rock magazines, and in 1992 she published several hundred of them as a book, ''Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.''         Ms. McCartney met her future husband while photographing the Beatles in London in 1967, and the pair carried on an occasional romance for more than a year. In September 1968, Mr. McCartney asked her to move to London, from which point they became inseparable. Although she took some stunning pictures of the Beatles at work, she left most of them unpublished until she assembled her ''Sixties'' book. Her photographs of Mr. McCartney, however, adorned some of his post-Beatles album covers, and in one of his early television specials, ''James Paul McCartney,'' he is shown singing a medley of his songs while his wife did a photo shoot.         In addition to Mr. McCartney and the daughter from her first marriage, Heather, Ms. McCartney is survived by three children from her marriage with Mr. McCartney: Mary, Stella and James; and by her brother John, who is now Mr. McCartney's lawyer and business manager, and two sisters, Laura and Louise.         Besides ''Sixties,'' Ms. McCartney published several other books, including ''Linda's Pictures,'' ''Sun Prints,'' ''Photographs'' and ''Road Works.'' Celebrities were by no means her only photographic subject. Plants, animals, natural patterns on rock faces and people she encountered on her travels engaged her interest and were captured with a touching refinement in many of her pictures. Her work has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, England, and at more than 50 galleries around the world.         Correction:  April 21, 1998, Tuesday  The obituary of the photographer Linda McCartney yesterday gave an incorrect name in some copies for the most recent studio album by her husband, the former Beatle Paul McCartney. It is ''Flaming Pie''; ''Off the Ground'' was the one before that.         Correction:  June 11, 1998, Thursday  The obituary of Linda McCartney on April 20 misstated her college background. She attended only the University of Arizona, not Sarah Lawrence College as well. The obituary also misstated the given name of her first husband in some copies. He was Melvin See, not Bob. The errors were pointed out in E-mail received from a reader yesterday.       
         Nicole Maxwell, a free-spirited San Francisco debutante who plunged into the remote Amazon jungles of Ecuador and Peru and came out with a trove of medicinal plants that she said Indians used to cure virtually every known ailment, died on May 5 in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 92, and left no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Maxwell, the author of the 1961 book ''Witch Doctor's Apprentice,'' had spent the last decades of her life in largely vain efforts to interest drug companies in her discoveries.         For a woman who was the toast of Paris in the 1920's, dancing ballet with the Opera, dallying with a raft of admirers and posing nude for artists, Mrs. Maxwell made an abrupt change in her life: After a 12-year marriage to an Air Force officer ended in 1945 (''I married a lieutenant and divorced a brigadier general''), she headed to South America to visit friends in Bolivia, later saying that since she had never been attracted to Latin men, she hoped to avoid distracting entanglements.         Whatever the distractions, Mrs. Maxwell stayed in South America for 12 years, running the first shoe-string tourist service in Lima, Peru, and later becoming a roving correspondent for The Lima Times.         It was during a chance venture into the jungle on a visit to Quito, Ecuador, in 1947 that Mrs. Maxwell first became fascinated with the jungles of the upper Amazon basin and its indigenous tribes.         Hacking her way through the jungle with an Indian guide the next year, she suffered a deep machete gash on her arm and made the discovery that would change her life.         With Mrs. Maxwell wondering whether she would bleed to death or die from infection, the guide ran into the jungle, returned with some dark red tree sap and had her drink it. When the bleeding stopped within minutes and the wound healed rapidly without a scar, Mrs. Maxwell knew she had found her life's work: ferreting out remedies used by the Indians for centuries and introducing them to the modern world.         The very idea of medicine struck a chord deep in her psyche. Growing up in a wealthy Christian Science family in San Francisco, Mrs. Maxwell had harbored a grudge against the religion ever since she broke her arm when she was 9 and was denied medical treatment until she went to a doctor on her own.         It was a streak of independence that would resurface a few years later when she contracted a teen-age marriage of convenience simply to escape her family, then obtained a divorce as soon as the couple reached Paris.         During her later marriage, when her Air Force husband was posted to Cambridge, Mass., Mrs. Maxwell talked the chairman of the Harvard biology department into helping her sign up for postgraduate courses.         By the time her husband was transferred to Ohio, Harvard professors had arranged for her to continue her studies at Ohio State. But when her husband was transferred to Washington a couple of years later, her unofficial formal education came to an end because Georgetown University would not admit women.         In the decade after her machete experience, Mrs. Maxwell made dozens of expeditions to the remotest regions of the upper Amazon, befriending the local Indians and slowly learning the secrets of their vast medical lore. To Indians whose experience with outsiders had been as victims of armed rubber merchants, an unarmed woman posed no threat.         In 1958, after obtaining a small grant from a drug company, Mrs. Maxwell made a special expedition, obtaining samples of many of the plants whose medicinal properties she had been carefully cataloguing.         When she returned and shipped her plants, including what she said was a variety of highly effective contraceptives, to the drug company, she was dismayed to discover that the company had regarded her trek as a publicity stunt and had no scientific interest in her findings.         Hoping to salvage something from her work, she wrote ''Witch Doctor's Apprentice.'' More adventure story than medical manual, the book, revised in 1975 and in 1990 (Citadel Press), nevertheless described a host of plants she said the Indians used to prevent tooth decay, painlessly extract teeth, dissolve kidney stones, heal burns and cure or prevent scores of other maladies.         Mrs. Maxwell returned to South America and continued her research until 1986, eventually collecting more than 350 plants used to treat more than 100 common ailments.         While her work was shunned by drug companies, Mrs. Maxwell, who made her home in Iquitos, Peru, became a heroine to a coterie of enthusiasts who would make pilgrimages to the compound where she held court to pay tribute, sometimes with unsettling results.         Once when an avid photographer of exotic birds gushingly exclaimed that she must be very familiar with the birds of South America, Mrs. Maxwell acknowledged that she was, ''mainly by taste.''         Her dream that the plants of the upper Amazon would become a multibillion-dollar cash crop and halt the destruction of the rain forest eluded her. But Mrs. Maxwell, who had been working with a Mississippi State scientist to produce a technical manual on Amazon remedies, remained confident that her work would be eventually be recognized by mainstream science.         ''As soon as I'm gone,'' she told a friend, ''they'll come running.''       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Virginia Graham, who went from writing radio soap operas in the 1940's to becoming one of the most successful and enduring of the early television talk show hosts, died on Tuesday in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Starting in the 1950's when she succeeded Margaret Truman as hostess of NBC Radio's ''Weekday'' series, in which she was teamed with Mike Wallace, she quickly became known for her spontaneity, irreverence and her ability to get good interviews from those who appeared on her shows.         ''From the first second I went on the air, I have been easy to communicate with,'' she said in 1965. For two decades, she presided over television talk shows including ''Food for Thought'' from 1956 to 1961; ''Girl Talk'' (1963-69); and ''The Virginia Graham Show''(1970-72).         ''Girl Talk'' was enormously successful. In its heyday it drew an average audience of 2 million who tuned in five days a week to watch Miss Graham interview the most celebrated women of the day, including Olivia de Havilland, Pearl S. Buck, Gloria Swanson, Louise Rainer, Ilka Chase, Cornelia Otis Skinner, Marian Javits, Hermione Gingold, Barbara Walters, Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers.         In the early days of television, she was also seen frequently on Jack Paar's ''Tonight'' show, and occasionally served as a substitute host on 'Strike It Rich'' and ''The Big Payoff.'' She also appeared on the ''Roseanne,'' ''Rosie O'Donnell'' and ''Tom Snyder'' shows.         She was also active in charity work, raising many millions for the American Cancer Society (she survived cervical cancer in the 1950's and spoke of it widely and often) as well as the foundations set up to research cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and kidney disease.         Miss Graham's husband, Harry Guttenberg, who ran a well-known theatrical costume company, died of kidney disease in 1980. She wrote about her experience in ''Life After Harry: My Adventures in Widowhood,'' which became a best seller.         Miss Graham was born on July 4, 1912, in Chicago, the daughter of David S. Komiss, a women's clothier, and the former Bessie J. Feiges.         She attended the University of Chicago, where she majored in anthropology and received a Phi Beta Kappa key. She then studied journalism at Northwestern University, and received a master's degree.         In the years that followed, she worked as a photographer's model and in 1934 did some fashion reporting for radio station WBBM in Chicago. In the 1930's she wrote scripts for commercials used on WMCA, a New York radio station.         After World War II, she contributed scripts for such radio soaps as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''Our Gal Sunday'' and ''Backstage Wife.''         In addition to her work in television, she appeared on the stage, including a Chicago production of Neil Simon's ''Barefoot in the Park.''         She wrote several books, the last of which, ''I Love Antiques but I Don't Want to Be One,'' is scheduled to be published next fall by Crown.         Miss Graham is survived by a daughter, Lynn Bohrer, and a granddaughter, Jan, both of New York; and a grandson, Stephen, of Singapore.
