         Adele Bishop, who was instrumental in reviving the popularity of decorative stencils in the United States, died on Jan. 30 at Lenoir Memorial Hospital in Kinston, N.C. She was 68 and lived in Greenville, N.C.         The cause of death was complications from a bone marrow transplant while she  was being treated for cancer, said a son, Christian Carone.         Miss Bishop once hoped to become an opera singer. But stenciling, an early American art form, became the focus of her life in the 1950's after she read a book about it and began reproducing some designs at her home in East Hampton, L.I., where she lived with her first husband, Nicholas Carone, an artist.         From that start, she built a custom stenciling business, adding a partner, Cile Lord, in 1960. Together they produced stencil kits designed for do-it-yourselfers and wrote "The Art of Decorative Stenciling" (Viking, 1976), a book that was a standard reference work for many years.         After moving to Vermont in 1970 with her second husband, John Callaway, Miss  Bishop opened a mail-order company, American Decorative Arts Inc., a name changed later to Adele Bishop Inc. In 1984, Wall Lenk Corporation acquired the business and moved it to Kinston. Until her death, Miss Bishop remained active as a designer and consultant.         Miss Bishop was born in Washington, N.C., on Feb. 4, 1927. She studied voice  at the Juilliard School in New York, as well as in France and Italy.         Besides her son Christian, she is survived by her husband, Robert T. Paul of  Greenville, and another son, Claude Carone of Claverack, N.Y.       
         Pamela R. Berdan, a landscape designer responsible for many gardens in the New York area, died on May 15 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 91.         The cause was cancer, said a friend, Deborah Peterson.         Ms. Berdan designed her best-known gardens in Greenwich Village, among them  the Sheridan Square garden, a small triangle that she transformed from a parking area, and the garden of St. John's in the Village Episcopal Church, at Waverly Place and West 11th Street.         The St. John's garden, under a canopy of ailanthus trees and in the shadow cast by the church, was planned so that some foliage or blossoms would be visible all year. It was developed by Ms. Berdan in 1974 and she tended it for years. A photograph of the garden is featured on the cover of "The City Gardener's Handbook: From Balcony to Backyard" by Linda Yang (Random House, 1990).         In 1982, when Ms. Berdan suffered two broken legs when struck by a car. she sent instructions for planting from her hospital bed.         Ms. Berdan was born in Toledo, Ohio, and attended Vassar College and the Beaux Arts Academy at Fontainbleau, France. She was associated as an interior designer with the Arden Studio in Manhattan before turning to horticulture.         She is survived by a sister, Jean Berdan of Washington.       
         Josephine DeNatale Butler, a dance educator, historian and author, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Mrs. Butler and her husband, Albert Butler, wrote "The Encyclopedia of Social Dance." She was also the founder and president of the Institute for Social Dance Studies in New York, dedicated to the preservation and documentation of the history of American social dancing.         In 1970, Mrs. Butler created the film, print and memorabilia archive of American social ballroom dancing at the dance division of the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts. For 50 years, she was the director of the Albert Butler School of Dance, which she and her husband founded in 1936.         The Butlers were a popular ballroom dance team for many years, performing in  Manhattan at the Ritz-Carlton, the Plaza and other hotels, as well as in Europe.         Mrs. Butler was born in New York City in 1911. Before taking up dance, she was a fashion consultant and high-fashion designer. She was a past president of  the International Dance Council and Dance Masters of America.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Margaret Bronson (Peggy) Clark, who designed the lighting for more than 60 Broadway productions, including "Brigadoon," "Bye Bye Birdie" and "Auntie Mame," died on Wednesday at her home in Lexington, Ga. She was 80.         She died after a series of strokes, said Elmon Webb, a friend.         Ms. Clark helped make lighting design a profession on Broadway and was one of the first women to achieve a career in the field. "She was a pioneer in creating the field," said Mr. Webb, a business agent for United Scenic Artists,  the union that represents lighting, scenic and costume designers.         Through the 1930's, lighting design was a relatively informal process, usually the province of electricians.  Ms. Clark got her first job as a lighting designer on Broadway in 1941. Her work caught the attention of Brooks Atkinson,  the drama critic of The New York Times.         She worked as an assistant to Oliver Smith on "On the Town" in 1944. Her work tended toward the naturalistic, not the experimental. "Peggy Clark's lighting gives the production a cool appearance," Mr. Atkinson noted in a 1958 review of  "The Threepenny Opera."         Ms. Clark designed the lighting for a number of George Abbott's shows, including "Paint Your Wagon," a revival of "Pal Joey," and "Wonderful Town." "George Abbot liked plenty of light downstage," Ms. Clark told The New Haven Register in 1955, "because that's where he plays all the comedy scenes."         Dame Judith Anderson, for whom Ms. Clark designed the lighting for the 1947 production of "Medea," demanded simply to "be seen," Ms. Clark said. The equipment arrived late, there was no time to rehearse and "Ms. Anderson usually  left the spot just before the light got to it."         Ms. Clark was born in Baltimore to an academic family. Her father, Dr. Eliot  R. Clark, was later a professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania. Ms. Clark wanted to be an actress, but, she told The New Haven Register, "I grew so tall I was cast only in men's parts."         In 1935, she graduated from Smith College. She went on to Yale, where she studied in the Department of Drama and Design, getting her master of fine arts degree in 1938.         In 1968, Ms. Clark was elected president of the United States Scenic Artists, Local 829, the first woman to hold that job. She taught lighting design at Smith College in 1967 and 1969, and at Yale Drama School in 1969 and 1970.         For many years, she lived in Brooklyn Heights, where she kept bulldogs. She was a president of the French Bull Dog Club of America.         Ms. Clark's husband, Lloyd R. Kelley, a theatrical electrician, died in 1972. She is survived by a brother, Douglas N. Clark, a professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens.       
         Geulah Abrahams, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at the Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. She was 65 and had homes in Princeton and New York.         She died after a brief illness, her husband, Elihu Abrahams, said.         Ms. Abrahams performed with the Paul Taylor Dance Company in 1963 and also danced with Mary Anthony, Pearl Lang and the Merry-Go-Rounders. She was on the dance faculty at Princeton University from 1975 to 1985. While there, she choreographed a production of Stravinsky's ''Soldier's Tale'' in collaboration with Michael Graves, the architect and designer, and Michael Pratt, the conductor.         She collaborated frequently with Paul Lansky, the composer, with whom she presented a retrospective program in New York and Princeton in 1995. She also choreographed for theater and opera with various directors, including Wilford Leach, Michael Kahn and Edward Berkeley.         Ms. Abrahams founded her own modern dance company, Geulah Abrahams Danceworks, in 1985. Interested in the connections between art and science, she created ''Dances in Physics'' in 1989 and presented the work at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles. She also taught and choreographed at the Ballet West summer school in Aspen, Colo.         During the past three years, she taught at the Aspen Music Festival and was the resident choreographer of the Aspen Opera House.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of New York City and David, of Cambridge, Mass., and by a brother, Shmuel Govreen of Jerusalem.       
         Elizabeth Eyre de Lanux, an American artist, writer and designer of 1920's Art Deco furnishings whose works were rediscovered in the late 1980's, died on Sunday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 102.         Mrs. de Lanux designed lacquered furniture and geometric patterned rugs that were produced in Paris in the 1920's. Her modernist furnishings were considered among the most sophisticated and were frequently exhibited with those of Eileen Gray and Jean-Michel Frank.         The designs of Eyre de Lanux, the name she used professionally from the 1920's on, came to light in 1989 when two pieces she had designed were offered in the widely publicized New York auction of the Art Deco collection of Robin Symes, a London antiquities dealer.         One of them, a lacquered table with a Cubist-inspired base from 1929, was reproduced in announcements of the sale, which included Mr. Symes's house, an 1860's carriage house that was modernized by Philip Johnson in 1949 for use as a guest house by the owners, Blanchette and John D. Rockefeller 3d.         By 1989, Mrs. de Lanux's whereabouts were unknown in the design world. But her name was listed in the Manhattan telephone book, and despite her great age and infirmities -- she was legally blind -- she granted several interviews. The table ''was a joke,'' she said. ''I made it as a caricature of a Cubist sculpture.''         Elizabeth Eyre was born in Johnstown, Pa., and studied painting at the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1918, she married Pierre de Lanux, a French writer and diplomat, who was visiting New York. World War I had just ended, and they immediately moved to Paris. She studied with Brancusi in the early 1920's and became a designer, illustrator and writer. The couple moved in literary and art circles with Andre Gide, Hemingway, Matisse, Picasso and Bernard Berenson. She wrote about that world for Town & Country magazine in the 1920's. And, after she returned to the United States, she wrote in the 1960's for The New Yorker and Harper's Bazaar. Mr. de Lanux died in 1955.         In her later years, Mrs. de Lanux continued as an interior decorator and as an illustrator of children's books, the last of which, ''Overheard in a Bubble Chamber,'' by Lillian Morrison, was published in 1981. Mrs. de Lanux lived alone until she moved in late July to the nursing home. She is survived by her daughter, Anne Strong of Shingle Springs, Calif., and two grandsons, Nicholas Eyre of Napa, Calif., and Paul Eyre of Honolulu.       
         Martha Phillips, a notable force in luxury fashion retailing for more than 60 years and an early supporter of many of today's leading designers, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98.         Martha, as she was generally known (Miss Martha to her employees), was for many years a well-known front-row figure at major fashion shows in New York and Europe and a booster of, among others, Valentino, Halston, Geoffrey Beene, James Galanos, Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and Zandra Rhodes at the beginning of their careers.         Her customers at her elegant Park Avenue and Palm Beach salons were some of the world's richest and most socially prominent women, who often filled in checks that ended in three and four zeros.         There were four Martha shops in the 1980's, when sales were said to be almost $40 million. A boutique in the Trump Tower closed after several years, and a bankruptcy filing in 1992, attributed to the economy, resulted in the shuttering of the Park Avenue salon and another in Bal Harbour, Fla. The Palm Beach shop, operated by Mrs. Phillips's daughter, Lynn Manulis, remains, and Mrs. Phillips went in almost daily until shortly before her death.         ''There was never anybody like her and there won't be anyone like her,'' Ms. Trigere said yesterday. The designer, who did business with Mrs. Phillips for almost a half-century, added, ''She developed a special knowledge of who her customer was -- from the very first client, she knew what she was doing.''         Mr. Beene described Mrs. Phillips as ''an icon to an audience of a more frivolous era of dressing -- steeped in vanity and femininity.''         And Mr. de la Renta called it ''the end of a whole era'' and Mrs. Phillips ''the last of the great ladies of retailing with a true grasp of the luxury business and a tremendous sense of quality.''         A small, meticulously groomed woman with carefully coiffed hair who wore signature David Webb jewelry, Mrs. Phillips did not hesitate to pop into fitting rooms as her customers tried on clothes. More often than not, she did not ask what they wanted but told them what they should have. More often than not, they listened. Although the salon had a workroom  for alterations, Mrs. Phillips also did not hesitate, on occasion, to get on her knees to pin a hem.         There was never a time when she was not fascinated by fashion, Mrs. Phillips said in a 1983 interview on the 50th anniversary of her business. Born Martha Rollins in Brooklyn, where her father had a shop called the Star that specialized in hand-tailored clothes and riding clothes, she asked to help in the business one day when she was 8. Her father got a crate, placed it behind the counter and she stood there after school, selling lace blouses.         ''People were so amused, they would buy,'' she recalled.         At 18, she married Phillip R. Phillips, a manufacturer of ready-to-wear clothing and in the early 1930's she opened a shop on the 12th floor of a Madison Avenue building. Despite the Depression, she refused to buy anything for the shop that would sell for less than $100.         ''I did very well,'' she said. Her customers included Marjorie Merriweather Post, who brought in her jewels to make certain that both the color and the neckline of the dress were appropriate for showing them off properly. Other clients were Doris Duke, Brooke Astor, Gloria Vanderbilt and Diana Ross.         Mrs. Phillips remained there for 20 years, leaving only when the building was torn down. She then leased space in what was the Savoy Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue. After that building was sold to the General Motors Corporation, she balked at a shop she was offered downstairs in the plaza of the new building to be built on the site, saying, ''Martha's customers never shop in cellars.''         Shortly after, she and her daughter, who joined her several years earlier, found a location at Park Avenue and 58th Street where in plush  surroundings she coddled her customers with tea and cookies while models paraded the clothes or saleswomen carried them out.         Mr. Phillips died in 1981. Besides  her daughter, who lives in Palm Beach, Mrs. Phillips is survived by a son, Herbert R. Phillips, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Milton Rollins of Brooklyn, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview when she was in her mid-80's, Mrs. Phillips, who was chairwoman of her company -- her daughter was president -- said she had no intention of ever retiring.         ''I like to think that what we're doing is being impresarios, finding talent,'' she said. ''I like the excitement.''       
         Suzanne Railey, a representative for Christie's auction house who was known for her talents as an international hostess, died last weekend in her Manhattan apartment. She was 85.         She died in her sleep, Ed Gallagher, a longtime friend, told Christie's. She had a list of guests for her next dinner party at her bedside, he said.         Ms. Railey, who was known as Sue, lived most of her life in Paris and New York, and had been employed by Christie's in New York since March 1985. She was a public relations ambassador of sorts. Her only  role for the auction house was to hold a black-tie dinner party at her home each month, drawing on her long list of wealthy and influential friends, many with extensive art collections. The idea was to generate good will, and eventually business, for the auction house.         Seated at the tables in her two bedroom apartment in the East 60's  would be diplomats, society doyennes and fashion designers.         ''It all depends who's in town and what I'm thinking about,'' Ms. Railey said during an interview last week.         The jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent dinner guest at her house, said: ''You never knew who you'd be seated next to. She always had good people. And her apartment was amazing, with more objects than you could count on every table and mirrors on the ceilings.''         Entertaining and collecting were what she enjoyed.         ''You must talk to me about dinner parties,'' Ms. Railey said, standing at Alexis Gregory's dinner party on Dec. 2, clutching a black pocketbook with a big white clock on top. ''I love them so much. It's just so much more attractive to entertain at home. You can actually sit and talk.''         Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's, said, ''Her apartment was filled with all these treasures of Europe.'' She collected portraits from the French Revolutionary period, miniatures and African works of art, and also had a large collection of letter seals.         She was born Suzanne Rosenberg in Rochester. Her family owned a department store. As a young girl she traveled to Manhattan, Washington and Paris with her parents, said David Granger, a longtime friend.         She lived in Manhattan during part of her 20's with an uncle, Ed Goodman, who owed Finchley's, a men's clothing store. Mr. Granger said, ''And she did what popular young girls do, she traveled and went to parties.''         Then she moved to Washington,  where she started Overcoats for Britain, a program shipping coats to England during World War II.         In 1950, she married Howard Barclay Railey, a businessman who was attached to the American Embassy in Paris. For the next 33 years, she lived and entertained in ''a romantic apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris,'' said Ethel de Croisset, a close friend who lives in Paris.         ''She was a born brilliant hostess,'' she said. ''She was always friends with all the ambassadors.'' When her husband died, Ms. Railey moved back to Manhattan and began working for Christie's.         She is survived by two stepsons.

         Leonor Fini, an Argentine-born artist and theater designer who was as well known for her eccentric lifestyle as she was for her erotic and fantastic paintings, died on Jan. 18 in a Paris hospital. She was 87.         Miss Fini, whose father was Argentine and mother was Italian, was born in Buenos Aires on Aug. 30, 1908. While she was still a child, the family moved to  Milan, where at 17 she had her first exhibition as a painter. In 1932 she settled in Paris, where she was drawn into the Surrealist movement, quickly joining a circle of artists that included Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst and Giorgio de Chirico.         She always insisted on going her own way as an artist. "I could never support the dogmatic and inquisitional way that the group approached its work,"  she once said of the Surrealists. Her work was nonetheless represented at the show "Fantastic Art: Dada Surrealism" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936.         Later she translated her idea of the fantastic into the female form, creating a whole population of young women in strange and exotic attires, sometimes with  their heads shaven, sometimes resembling fairies or witches, often exuding a kind of Joan of Arc mystique. The erotic memoir "The Story of O" was one of many books she illustrated.         Some of her most important work, though, was done for the theater, and included both sets and costumes. She was the designer for George Balanchine's ballet "The Crystal Palace" at the Paris Opera in 1945 and she worked at the Comedie Francaise, for Jean-Louis Barrault's theater company, and at La Scala opera house in Milan. She did the sets for plays by Jean Genet and Jean Anouilh  in the 1960's.         A very public figure with her own loyal circle of admirers, Miss Fini always  insured that she stood out in a crowd. In recent years she was frequently seen at art-show openings wearing heavy makeup, unusual clothes, wide-brim hats and ample jewelry. She never married, and filled her home with cats that she often used as models for her illustrations.
