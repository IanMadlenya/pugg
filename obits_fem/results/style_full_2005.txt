         Marjorie Williams, a Washington Post columnist and contributing editor for Vanity Fair who was known for sharp observations on the political elite, died yesterday at her home in Washington. She was 47.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Timothy Noah.         Ms. Williams became a columnist in 2000, after more than a decade of writing lengthy profiles on Washington power brokers, including Vice President Al Gore and the Democratic diplomat Clark Clifford.         Her column was syndicated in July 2001, the same week her fourth-stage cancer was diagnosed, Mr. Noah said.         Ms. Williams attended Harvard for two years, but dropped out and went to work in publishing, where she worked for several years before getting a job as an editor at The Post. Later, she asked to move to a writing position in The Post's Style section and frequently wrote for Vanity Fair.         ''What she used to say at the time was, 'I want to be one of the children as opposed to one of the grown-ups,'' said Mr. Noah, a writer for Slate who frequently showed his wife his own stories. ''But what she was most proud of was being a mom.''         In a column published last November, Ms. Williams wrote of her helping her daughter dress in an elaborate Halloween costume.         ''So how could I explain the euphoria of the 45 minutes Alice and I spent in her bedroom, colluding over her hair, giggling at her faux leather, deeply fringed bell-bottoms? The pleasure of watching her strap on those awful silver platform shoes, like something I wore in 1973?'' she wrote. ''I'd just seen Alice leave for her prom, or her first real date. I'd cheated time, flipping the calendar five or six years into the future. The character I'd played was the 52-year-old mother I will probably never be.''         In addition to her husband and her daughter, Ms. Williams is survived by her son, Will, and her sisters, Wistar Rawls of Monkton, Vt., Anne Williams of Ringoes, N.J., and Rosina Williams of Jersey City.       
         Miriam Rothschild, the heiress who discovered how fleas jump, brought Chaucerian wildflowers back to modern England and was acknowledged as one of the world's most distinguished naturalists, died Thursday at her home, Ashton Wold, in Northamptonshire. She was 96.         Her death was announced by her family.         Her extensive scientific and conservation achievements were matched by the might of her will and her delectably eccentric personality.         ''Imagine Beatrix Potter on amphetamines,'' The Times of London once said of her.         Though she viewed herself as a naturalist, more of a describer than an experimenter, she was taken seriously as a scientist and often worked with distinguished colleagues. Her well-known work on butterflies making themselves toxic by means of their food choices was done with the chemist Tadeus Reichstein, a Nobel Prize winner. Her highly original observations helped confirm 19th-century theories of evolution that had awaited 20th-century chemistry.         Given the title of dame by the queen in 1999 for her scientific achievements, she was more than a scientist, not least because she never had to fill out a grant application.         Was it odd that a scion of the venerable Rothschild clan should become the world's leading expert on fleas? Hardly. Dame Miriam's father was the banker Nathaniel Charles Rothschild, who found more than 500 new species of fleas. His daughter's six-volume catalog of his collection of 30,000 specimens, which she completed in 20 years beginning in 1953, firmly established her as the flea authority other experts consulted.         Her uncle Lionel Walter Rothschild's collections were just as inspirational. He amassed 2.3 million butterflies, 300,000 bird skins, 144 giant tortoises and 300,000 birds' eggs, among other things..         From her earliest youth, Dame Miriam loved animals and plants. Her mind was free to roam, and she received no formal education until she was 17, when she demanded to go to school. She never earned any degree, but received an honorary doctorate from Oxford in 1968.         Ranging from marine biology to chemistry to pharmacology to neurophysiology to horticulture to zoology, she came up with novel, often startling conclusions.         Her research on insects eating substances that are poisonous to their predators was considered groundbreaking. After determining that butterflies' bright colors were warning signals of their toxicity, she found that other species evolved to mimic the danger-sign coloration. She found that odors emitted by toxic butterflies were mimicked by other species, vindicating 19th-century naturalists' speculations.         Her enthusiasm for wildflowers led to her advising Prince Charles on plantings for his estate and Lady Bird Johnson on her program to beautify American roadsides.         Her interests ranged far beyond science. During World War II she tenaciously pressed the British authorities to admit more Jews from Nazi Germany and at one point personally housed 49 Jewish children. She worked in the top-secret British effort at Bletchley Park to crack the Nazis' code.         She fought for cause upon cause, including better treatment for laboratory animals, rights for homosexuals and free milk for schoolchildren.         Her farm at the family estate of Ashton Wold, near Peterborough, was a passion and her main source of income. Her livestock and plants won awards.         She did it all with a zestfully personal sense of style, wearing the loose-fitting clothes she designed for herself 50 years ago as she walked the grounds with her half-dozen pet Shetland sheepdogs.         Miriam Louisa Rothschild was born on Aug. 5, 1908, at Ashton Wold, where she lived her entire life. Her mother, Rozika de Wertheimstein, was a top Hungarian sportswoman, and Dame Miriam herself played tennis, cricket and squash, the last in international competitions.         Her childhood, as described in a 1987 New Yorker profile by Kennedy Fraser, was ''like a fairy tale: the palatial houses stuffed with mysteries and treasures; the grandfather who liked to shower gold half-sovereigns from his carriage; the brilliant dotty uncle with his cassowaries and his white top hat.''         Her first love was nature. By the age of 4 she was collecting ladybugs and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her.         Her world darkened when she was 15 and her father committed suicide. She temporarily lost interest in his passion, the natural world. But a year or two later, her enthusiasm was rekindled when she helped her brother dissect a frog.         ''I had never before seen fresh, internal organs, blood vessels and nerves,'' she wrote in an essay in Scientific American. Calling the experience ''my road to Damascus,'' she wrote, ''Their extreme beauty was a revelation.''         After taking some courses at the University of London, she worked in Naples and England studying a kind of mollusk.         ''During the first day of dissecting the bivalve,'' she wrote in Scientific American, ''I found a specimen infested with larval trematodes,'' which are parasitic flatworms known as flukes. ''It proved to be a hitherto undescribed species and a most extraordinary one from every point of view. My fate was sealed. I was completely hooked.''         She worked 16-hour days studying trematodes until a German bomb destroyed all traces of seven years of her research.         With the war, she passed a test to be an air warden but was first assigned to work as a dairymaid. She was secretly summoned to work on the top-secret Enigma code-breaking project and labored 12 hours a day for several years with Alan Turing.         In 1943 she married George Lane, a handsome Hungarian-born British commando. They had four children and adopted two more before divorcing in 1957. She is survived by one of her sons and three of her daughters.         As she raised her children, her late-night attention turned to fleas. She began writing about them in clear, engaging prose.         In ''Fleas, Flukes & Cuckoos: A Study of Bird Parasites,'' which she wrote with Theresa Clay in 1952 (Philosophical Library), she argued that most people misunderstood fleas.         ''It is difficult for them to realize that fleas breathe through holes in their sides, have a nerve cord below their stomachs and a heart in their backs; or that certain arthropods lay eggs through their heads and regularly practice virgin birth.''         Using high-speed photography, she studied how fleas jump. She theorized that they descended from winged ancestors and employed modified flight structures. In a famous comparison, she said fleas jump as high for fleas as the Empire State Building would be for humans.         Turning to plants as well as animals, she became one of the first practitioners of the new interdisciplinary approach to biological studies called ecology.         She began designing gardens to attract butterflies, writing extensively on the subject.         ''You can really abandon any romantic idea of creating a home for these angelic creatures,'' she wrote in ''The Butterfly Gardener,'' published in 1983. ''The best you can do is provide them with a good pub.'' She owned a pub for humans, in Ashton, decorated with natural history exhibits.         In 1970 she began to collect, propagate and sell wildflower seeds.         ''In the early 1980's, I went to a lecture given by a distinguished zoologist who said we should preserve our medieval hayfields, because it would take a thousand years to grow one from scratch,'' she said. ''After the lecture I told him I had done a good imitation in 10. From that moment, I thought I should spread the gospel.''         Spread it she did, to Mrs. Johnson and Prince Charles. As a result of the movement she led, British agriculture policies that favored replacing natural meadows with rye grass were reversed.         She remained as down to earth as the stone ruin her own house became as she deliberately let an immense tangle of ivy, wisteria, clematis and roses envelop it.       
         Nathalie Krassovska, a Russian-born ballerina who toured the United States for many years with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and was known for her lyricism, died on Tuesday in Dallas. She was 86.         The cause was complications of surgery, said Natalie Skelton of the Dallas Dance Council.         Miss Krassovska was also a ballerina of the London Festival Ballet. She settled in Dallas in 1963 and helped encourage dance activities there.         A beautiful woman with luminous blue eyes, she performed the standard 19th-century repertory with both the Ballet Russe and Festival Ballet and was especially known for her ''Giselle.'' With the Ballet Russe, she also danced works by 20th-century choreographers like Michel Fokine, Léonide Massine, Bronislava Nijinska and George Balanchine.         Born in Petrograd, as St. Petersburg was then called, Miss Krassovska grew up in Western Europe and was trained in Paris and London. She appeared with the Nijinska Ballet in 1932 and Balanchine's short-lived Les Ballets 1933, but first achieved prominence in 1936 as a member of Les Ballets de Monte Carlo. There she encountered Fokine, the great reformer of 20th-century ballet, who personally coached her in many of his productions.         The Monte Carlo troupe merged in 1938 with a new organization calling itself Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Miss Krassovska became one of its principal dancers. The group made the United States its base when World War II broke out and spent most of every year on the road.         On tour, Miss Krassovska established herself as a specialist in balletic Romanticism. She first performed the title role of ''Giselle,'' perhaps the greatest of Romantic ballets, in Montreal in 1949, prompting S. Morgan-Powell, dance critic of The Montreal Daily Star, to write, ''Her dancing was characterized by a purity of style not often seen nowadays in ballet.''         Miss Krassovska also danced some unexpected parts. Thus she had to learn tap dancing for her role as a debutante in ''The New Yorker,'' Massine's 1940 comedy inspired by cartoons in the magazine of that name.         Miss Krassovska left the Ballet Russe in 1950 to become a ballerina of London Festival Ballet, where she stayed through 1955. Of both Russian and Scottish ancestry, she danced in Great Britain under the name of Nathalie Leslie. But she returned to the Ballet Russe as guest artist under her familiar surname in the late 50's.         After moving to Dallas, she opened a school and founded a student company, Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse.       
         Eleanor Gould Packard, whose questions, comments and admonitions on the proofs of thousands of articles for The New Yorker for 54 years defined for many the care (some writers said obsessiveness) taken in editing the magazine, died Sunday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her daughter, Susan Hathaway Packard.         Miss Gould, as she was known to the staff, challenged the logic, syntax, grammar, flow, usage, punctuation and vocabulary of a legion of nonfiction writers: E.B. White, Roger Angell, Wolcott Gibbs, Ved Mehta, Pauline Kael, Philip Hamburger, John McPhee, Lillian Ross. Many at The New Yorker believed the precisely penciled Gould proofs sustained its suavity of style.         David Remnick, the magazine's editor, once said: ''I think if there is an indispensable person here, it's Eleanor Gould. The relationship to her is as intimate as it gets; she has been inside my sentences.''         Invoking Harold Ross, the magazine's founding editor, Mr. Hamburger said, ''It is my impression that she brought to fruition an idea that Ross had, that everything should be looked at by a skeptical eye, not a cynical one, before it was presented to the public.''         Mr. Hamburger, who was interviewed several years before his death, sighed a little. ''Such probity and intelligence,'' he said.         Miss Gould's own view of her work was less glorified: ''I just try to make things right.''         Her work was not easily encompassed in a job title, and the magazine never saw a need to give her one. She was not a fact-checker, though she did find errors. She was not a story editor, copy editor or proofreader. She did not enter the process until an article had been examined by lawyers and editors and was in galley proof, close to the last minute. She worked her way down both margins, penciling corrections and suggestions in a legible hand, always providing her rationale.         ''A miracle to watch,'' said Edith Iglauer, an editor who once worked with her. ''The words danced across the page.''         As all editors know, showing such a thing to a tetchy or insecure writer might induce a tantrum. ''Not every writer gets to see a Gould proof,'' Mr. Angell said while she was still on the job. ''It's a challenge. You have to take a Gould proof seriously because she is a scrupulous reader, but you have to know what to ignore.'' If everything she recommended had been carried forward, he said, ''it would be like the purest water -- absolutely tasteless.''         Yet Mr. Remnick said on her death, ''If it's true The New Yorker is known for the clarity of its prose, then Miss Gould had as much to do with establishing that as its more famous editors and writers.''         He said that she had been greatly missed since a stroke took her off the job in 1999, but that there were still editors on the staff she had helped to train.         Miss Gould never used a computer and deadline pressure could sometimes render her handwritten work moot, especially during Tina Brown's chaotic six years as editor.         Eleanor Gould was born Oct. 3, 1917, in Newark, N.Y., to Wilson Mosher Gould, a lawyer, and Eleanor Loveland Gould. The family moved to Ohio and Eleanor graduated from high school in East Palestine, Ohio, in 1934. She won a scholarship to Oberlin and graduated summa cum laude with a major in English in 1938.         Aline Kilmer, a poet in New Jersey, became her mentor after years of correspondence Eleanor had initiated at 14. Kilmer taught her editing and helped her come to New York, and after several miserably paid editing jobs she applied to The New Yorker.         There was a myth that she flyspecked an entire issue and enclosed it with her application. But she described an application of less hubris: she noted two mistakes in recent issues, including, good Lord, a ''different than.''         She joined The New Yorker Nov. 5, 1945. Her marriage to Frederick A. Packard, also on the magazine's staff, came a year later, and the birth of their only child, Susan, a little more than a year after that. Her daughter and two grandsons survive.         In 1952, the family moved to Central Park West and 101st Street, where Miss Gould remained as long as she worked. She took a bus to the office on West 43rd Street, carrying a small lunch in an old shoe bag. For amusement, Miss Gould, who belonged at one time to Mensa, an organization of the supersmart, would factor the four-digit bus identification numbers.         In an interview in the summer of 1998, Miss Gould said she hoped to ''complete a century of Packards'' at The New Yorker. Her husband worked there for 45 years before he died in 1974. But for the stroke the year before, Miss Gould would have reached 55 years in 2000.         She was proud of her status. She cited the pinnacle she reached in 1972: a separate credit in ''The Elements of Style,'' the hugely popular text written by William Strunk Jr. and revived by E.B. White. The citation, which says, ''The co-author, E.B. White, is most grateful to Eleanor Gould Packard for her assistance in preparation of this second edition,'' recognized her as the linguistic equivalent of the Pope's confessor.         Interviewing Miss Gould for this obituary put the writer on the spot. Because she had been deaf since 1990, all questions had to be written; because of her status as a legendary editor, spelling counted. While asking about a Roger Angell statement, the interviewer at first wrote the name ''Angel,'' then added the second l. Miss Gould observed, ''I was going to say ''         Always the arbiter, she added, with amusement, ''I'll have to stage a faked death and come back to correct my obit.''       
         Alice Thomas Ellis, a British novelist celebrated for her witty, unflinching dissections of middle-class domestic life, died on Tuesday in London. She was 72 and lived in Wales.         A spokeswoman for Ms. Ellis's literary agent, Robert Kirby, confirmed the death. No cause was given, but several British newspapers reported that Ms. Ellis had been ill with lung cancer for some time.         Far better known in Britain than in the United States, Ms. Ellis's fiction defied easy categorization. With its blend of the transcendently spiritual and the achingly mundane, her work was compared, variously, to that of Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh, Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark.         Alice Thomas Ellis was the pseudonym of Anna Margaret Haycraft, who under her real name was an editor at Gerald Duckworth, the London publishing house run by her husband, Colin Haycraft.         Under her pen name, Ms. Ellis wrote a dozen slender novels, most published by Duckworth, among them ''The Sin Eater'' (1977); ''The Birds of the Air'' (1980); ''The Summer House,'' a trilogy (Penguin, 1994); and ''Fairy Tale'' (Moyer Bell, 1998). Her novel ''The 27th Kingdom'' (1982) was finalist for the Booker Prize.         She also published several nonfiction works, including ''A Welsh Childhood'' (Moyer Bell, 1997) and ''Serpent on the Rock: A Personal View of Christianity'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1994).         Reviewing ''The Summer House'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1994, Francine Prose wrote, ''Its quick humor, prickly ironies and lack of portentous self-importance may mislead casual readers into overlooking its true heft, its provocative and disturbing shrewdness.''         Shot through with melancholy, Ms. Ellis's novels focus on the small savageries, deep discontents and abiding grief of women's lives. Yet they are also mordantly funny sendups of bourgeois manners. Sometimes, as in the work of Shirley Jackson, the gothic overlays the domestic, to unsettling effect. Many of Ms. Ellis's characters are repellent, and they are meant to be.         A spare stylist, Ms. Ellis could sketch a devastating portrait in a single phrase. In ''The Birds of the Air,'' she describes one character, an academic, as a man whose ''insistence on ordinary language and absolute clarity of expression rendered his discourse unintelligible to the ordinary person.''         Ms. Ellis was born Anna Margaret Lindholm in Liverpool on Sept. 9, 1932, and raised in Wales. Her father and mother were devout secular humanists, and at 19, Anna rebelled by converting to Roman Catholicism.She entered a convent as a postulant, but back problems forced her to leave the order, with its requirement of physical labor. She settled in London, where she met Mr. Haycraft; they were married in 1956 and had seven children. She eventually joined him as a fiction editor at Duckworth, where her list of writers included the novelist Beryl Bainbridge.         In 1977 Ms. Ellis published her own first novel, ''The Sin Eater.'' Set in Wales, it tells of a family drawn uneasily home by the impending death of its patriarch. In The Spectator, Peter Ackroyd praised the book for ''its wit: the relentlessness of domestic life, the knives only just sheathed in time.'' Ms. Ellis's pen name, chosen perhaps for its sibilant hiss, suited her style of elegant malice.         Ms. Ellis, who also wrote on domestic life and religion for several British publications, remained a passionately traditional Catholic who deplored efforts to modernize the church. In 1996 she was fired as a columnist for The Catholic Herald after she attacked the reforms of Derek Worlock, archbishop of Liverpool, who had recently died.         Ms. Ellis is survived by four sons, William, Thomas, Oliver and Arthur, and a daughter, Sarah. Another daughter, Rosalind Mary, died in infancy, and a son, Joshua, died in an accident as a teenager. Ms. Ellis's husband died in 1994.         Throughout her work, on subjects large and small, Ms. Ellis was concerned with the futility of connection. In 1987 The Times of London asked several prominent people to compose a Valentine's Day verse. Ms. Ellis's submission began, dryly: ''Men love women/Women love children/Children love hamsters.''       
         Marilyn Levine, a prominent ceramic sculptor known for deceptively realistic renditions of leather goods, died on April 2 at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 69.         The cause was mucosal melanoma, said John Allen, her partner of 25 years.         Ms. Levine was born Marilyn Hayes in Medicine Hat, Alberta, in 1935 and grew up in Calgary. Interested in art as a child, she veered toward math and science, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. She also married a chemist, Sydney Levine, in 1969; they divorced in 1977.         With teaching jobs for women scarce, Ms. Levine began studying art intermittently at the University of Regina. By the late 1960's, she was committed to ceramics and exhibiting frequently in Canada. In 1969, she and her husband moved to the Bay Area, where California Funk, a quasi-Surrealistic style that embraced ceramics along with goofy, exaggerated representations of daily life, was heating up. She earned a master of arts (1970) and a master of fine arts (1971) from University of California, Berkeley, whose well-known ceramics faculty included Peter Voulkos.         Ms. Levine's Funk phase included sculptures of shoes and sneakers oozing bright glaze. When a friend brought her his beat-up work shoes, she began to see old leather objects as metaphors for the passage of time and the scars of life. She developed a meticulous trompe l'oeil style, capturing in fired clay and glaze the forms, surfaces and creases of much-used luggage, gloves, hand-bags, a golf bag, a knapsack and even leather jackets hanging from coat hooks.         Along with figurative sculptors like Duane Hanson and John De Andrea, her work was initially seen as a three-dimensional equivalent of Photo Realism and was included in ''Sharp-Focus Realism'' at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York in 1971.         But as time passed, her career unfolded mostly in the ceramics world.         Ms. Levine showed at the Hansen Fuller Gallery in San Francisco in 1971 and had her first New York show at the Bernard Danenberg Gallery in 1973. In 1974 she had the first of seven exhibitions at the O.K. Harris Gallery in SoHo. In the mid 1990's, she began to revisit her Funk beginnings with ceramic cups that appeared to be made of cut-up leather sneakers.         Ms. Levine's work is in the collections of many museums in the United States and Canada; in 1998, it was the subject of a retrospective at MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina.         In addition to Mr. Allen, Ms. Levine is survived by a brother, Robert Hayes of Calgary.         Correction:  April 13, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Marilyn Levine, a ceramic sculptor, misstated the year of her marriage to Sydney Levine, from whom she was later divorced. It was 1959, not 1969.       
         Kay Gardella, a television critic and columnist for The Daily News who worked at that paper for nearly 60 years, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 82.         The News, reporting her death, said she had been ill with cancer.         Ms. Gardella was born in Belleville, N.J., and graduated from the old Upsala College in East Orange. Two years later, in 1946, she took a job at The News as a copy girl and then became a writer covering crime and life style features.         She was named radio and television editor in 1975 and became the television critic in 1981 and a weekly columnist in 1993. Her last column appeared on March 19.         Ms. Gardella was married to Anthony Marino, a reporter and editor at The News who died several years ago. She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Ida Libby Dengrove, a New York courtroom artist who visualized the moods and faces of some notorious trials for the television audience, died on Wednesday while on a family visit to Los Angeles. She was 86 and lived in Ocean Township, N.J.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         A portrait painter away from court, Mrs. Dengrove worked as a courtroom illustrator for NBC-TV from 1973 to 1986. It allowed her to take her sketch pad where cameras were forbidden and capture the proceedings in her own distinctive style.         Her pictorial reportage won two Emmy awards. She was cited for her newscast illustrations of the sensational Son of Sam trial of David Berkowitz (1977-78), and again for the Murder at the Met trial (1980-81) of Craig S. Crimmins, the stagehand convicted of slaying a young violinist, Helen Hagnes Mintiks.         She sketched the principals in the trial of Jean Harris for the murder of Dr. Herman Tarnower and documented court appearances by John Lennon, Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., John W. Hinckley Jr., John J. Gotti and Gen. William C. Westmoreland, to name a few. Some of her sketches, meant for television, also turned up on the front pages of newspapers.         Ida Libby Leibovitz was born in Philadelphia, where she later graduated, in 1940, from Moore College of Art and Design. She taught art in the city's public school system until World War II, which she spent touring the United States for the U.S.O., sketching servicemen.         Later in her career, she taught again and lectured at various colleges and organizations.         Mrs. Dengrove's husband of 64 years, Dr. Edward Dengrove, a psychiatrist, died in 2003. She is survived by two sons, Richard A., of Arlington, Va., and Robert S., of Ocean Township; a daughter, Lois Ann, of Los Angeles; and four granddaughters.         Mrs. Dengrove herself fell victim to a crime in 1982. Eighty of her courtroom sketches were mounted in a lobby show at the United States Court House at Foley Square, a gallery of the famous in a place normally brimming with guards and federal marshals.         Yet one Monday morning, a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono was gone from its place high up on a wall. She had caught the couple in pastel in 1975, when deportation charges against Lennon were dropped, and -- her usual procedure -- had kept the original after it was taped for broadcast.         ''They took it like they took the Mona Lisa,'' she noted at the time. ''They removed it from the frame and left the frame and mat on the lobby floor.''         ''Somebody must have climbed on a chair,'' she said.       
         Raisa Struchkova, one of the Soviet Union's leading ballerinas in the Bolshoi Ballet when that company first took audiences abroad by storm in the 1950's and 60's, died in Moscow on Monday, the Bolshoi Theater announced. She was 79 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Struchkova was highly praised at home for her classical dancing, especially in ''Giselle'' and ''Cinderella.'' But for American audiences who were stunned by the athletic vigor of the Bolshoi at its New York debut in 1959, Ms. Struchkova will always be associated with the high-flying virtuosity that she showed in Soviet-style bravura duets with her husband, Aleksandr Lapauri.         Their signature piece in this genre was ''Moszkowski Waltz,'' choreographed by Assaf Messerer. Ms. Struchkova and Mr. Lapauri, dressed in white, wowed audiences with acrobatic lifts and tosses for the ballerina and then moved to opposite ends of the stage before she raced across and threw herself into her partner's arms. Even in the 1960's, when their performances were no longer a novelty, viewers in the Metropolitan Opera House sprang to their feet in a frenzy.         Yet Ms. Struchkova's main teacher at the Bolshoi school was Yelizaveta Gerdt, the epitome of refined classical style. After Mr. Lapauri died in 1975, Ms. Struchkova retired from dancing in 1978 and coached younger ballerinas, including Nina Ananiashvili, in the 19th-century classics.         The daughter of a factory worker, Ms. Struchkova was born in Moscow on Oct. 5, 1925, and graduated from the Bolshoi school in 1944. She joined the company that year. Already noticed for what Soviet critics called her femininity as well as her strong technique, she showed off a comic gift in her first major role as Lise in ''La Fille Mal Gardée'' in 1946. Although she was not the first ballerina to dance the title role in the Bolshoi's ''Cinderella,'' choreographed to Prokofiev's score by Rostislav Zakharov in 1945, she triumphed in the part in 1947 with the expressive simplicity of her portrayal. She never achieved the international superstar status of Galina Ulanova and Maya Plisetskaya at the Bolshoi. But ''Cinderella'' made her a star.         Possibly influenced by her bravura in the showpiece duets (which included another ''Waltz,'' to music by Dunievsky), some critics in the international ballet world considered Ms. Struchkova too much of a powerhouse performer to be a model in the classics. Yet she danced the leading roles in ''Swan Lake,'' ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Giselle,'' ''Don Quixote,'' and ''The Nutcracker'' and in contemporary Soviet ballets, including ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The government awarded her the order of Lenin and named her People's Artist of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.         She taught ballet from 1962 at GITIS, the State Theatrical Institute of the Arts, and from 1978 was a ballet mistress and coach at the Bolshoi. From 1981 to 1995 she was the founding editor of the magazine Ballet, originally called Soviet Ballet.       
         Carolyn Brady, an artist known for her large Photorealist watercolor paintings, died on May 5 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. She was 67 and lived in New York City.         The cause was complications after heart surgery, said her dealer in New York, Nancy Hoffman.         Ms. Brady arrived at her signature style in the mid-1970's, when realism was enjoying a revival. She began painting flowers in vases, table settings and other scenes based on photographs that she took in and around her home. With their sharp focus, luminous colors and dimensions as great as 60 by 90 inches, her paintings have a hyper-realistic visual impact rarely encountered in the medium of watercolor.         Carolyn Brady was born on May 22, 1937, in Chickasha, Okla. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the University of Oklahoma in Norman in 1959 and went on to earn her Master of Fine Arts degree at the same school in 1961. She had her first solo exhibition in 1975 at Nancy Singer Gallery in St. Louis and the first of many New York solo shows at Nancy Hoffman Gallery in SoHo in 1977.         Ms. Brady's works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington; and the Art Institute of Chicago, among numerous other institutions.         Ms. Brady is survived by her husband, the sculptor Bill Epton, and her son, Alexander Brady Epton, both of New York City.       
         Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights lawyer who fought nearly every important civil rights case for two decades and then became the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, died yesterday at NYU Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Isolde Motley, her daughter-in-law.         Judge Motley was the first black woman to serve in the New York State Senate, as well as the first woman to be Manhattan borough president, a position that guaranteed her a voice in running the entire city under an earlier system of local government called the Board of Estimate.         Judge Motley was at the center of the firestorm that raged through the South in the two decades after World War II, as blacks and their white allies pressed to end the segregation that had gripped the region since Reconstruction. She visited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in jail, sang freedom songs in churches that had been bombed, and spent a night under armed guard with Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader who was later murdered.         But her métier was in the quieter, painstaking preparation and presentation of lawsuits that paved the way to fuller societal participation by blacks. She dressed elegantly, spoke in a low, lilting voice and, in case after case, earned a reputation as the chief courtroom tactician of the civil rights movement.         Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and other staunch segregationists yielded, kicking and screaming, to the verdicts of courts ruling against racial segregation. These huge victories were led by the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, for which Judge Motley, Jack Greenberg, Robert Carter and a handful of other underpaid, overworked lawyers labored.         In particular, she directed the legal campaign that resulted in the admission of James H. Meredith to the University of Mississippi in 1962. She argued 10 cases before the United States Supreme Court and won nine of them.         Judge Motley won cases that ended segregation in Memphis restaurants and at whites-only lunch counters in Birmingham, Ala. She fought for King's right to march in Albany, Ga. She played an important role in representing blacks seeking admission to the Universities of Florida, Georgia Alabama and Mississippi and Clemson College in South Carolina.         She helped write briefs in the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and in later elementary-school integration cases.         Judge Motley was a tall, gracious and stately woman whose oft-stated goal was as simple as it was sometimes elusive: dignity for all people. Her personal approach was also dignified. When a reporter wrote that she had demanded some action by the court, she soon corrected him:         ''What do you mean 'I demanded the court'? You don't demand, you pray for relief or move for some action.''         Charlayne Hunter-Gault, whose admission to the University of Georgia was engineered by Mrs. Motley's legal finesse, described her courtroom cunning.         ''Mrs. Motley's style could be deceptive, often challenging a witness to get away with one lie after another without challenging them,'' she wrote in her book ''In My Place,'' published in 1992. ''It was as if she would lull them into an affirmation of their own arrogance, causing them to relax as she appeared to wander aimlessly off into and around left field, until she suddenly threw a curveball with so much skill and power it would knock them off their chair.''         As a black woman practicing law in the South, she endured gawking and more than a few physical threats. A local paper in Jackson, Miss., derided her as ''the Motley woman.''         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York at the urging of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, a Democrat, and with the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a Republican. The opposition of Southern senators like James O. Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, was beaten back, and her appointment was confirmed. She became chief judge of the district in 1982 and senior judge in 1986.         Constance Baker was born on Sept. 14, 1921, in New Haven, the ninth of 12 children. Her parents came from the tiny Caribbean island Nevis at the beginning of the 20th century.         Her father worked as a chef for various Yale University student organizations, including Skull and Bones. She attended local schools in what was then an overwhelmingly white community.         One of her first experiences with discrimination came at 15, when she was turned away from a public beach because she was black.         She read books dealing with black history and became president of the local N.A.A.C.P. youth council. She decided that she wanted to be a lawyer, but her family lacked money to send their many children to college. After high school, she struggled to earn a living as a domestic worker.         When she was 18, she made a speech at local African-American social center that was heard by Clarence W. Blakeslee, a white businessman and philanthropist who sponsored the center. He was impressed and offered to finance her education.         She decided to attend Fisk University, a black college in Nashville, partly because she had never been to the South. In Nashville, she encountered a rigidly segregated society, and brought her parents a poignant souvenir: a sign that read ''Colored Only.''         After a year and a half at Fisk, she transferred to New York University. After graduation in 1943, she entered Columbia Law School, where she began to work as a volunteer at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, an affiliate of the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People that Mr. Marshall and his mentor, Charles Houston, had created in 1939.         After she graduated in 1946, she began to work full time for the civil rights group at a salary of $50 a week. She worked first on housing cases, fighting to break the restrictive covenants that barred blacks from white neighborhoods.         Also in 1946, she married Joel Wilson Motley Jr., a New York real estate broker. He survives her, as does their son, Joel III, who lives in Scarborough, N.Y.; three grandchildren; her brother Edmund Baker of Florida; and her sisters Edna Carnegie, Eunice Royster and Marian Green, all of New Haven.         Mr. Marshall had no qualms about sending her into the tensest racial terrain, precisely because she was a woman. She said she believed that was why she was assigned to the Meredith case in 1961.         ''Thurgood says that the only people who are safe in the South are the women -- white and Negro,'' she said in an interview with Pictorial Living, the magazine of The New York Journal-American, in 1965. ''I don't know how he's got that figured. But, so far, I've never been subjected to any violence.''         Mr. Meredith's admission to the University of Mississippi in September 1962 was a major victory for the civil rights movement. Mrs. Motley worked on the case for 18 months before Mr. Meredith's name was even seen in the papers.         She made 22 trips to Mississippi as the case dragged on. Judge Motley once called the day Mr. Meredith accepted his diploma in 1963 the most thrilling in her life.         She said her greatest professional satisfaction came with the reinstatement of 1,100 black children in Birmingham who had been expelled for taking part in street demonstrations in the spring of 1963.         In February 1964, Mrs. Motley's high-level civil rights profile drew her into politics. A Democratic State Senate candidate from the Upper West Side was ruled off the ballot because of an election-law technicality. She accepted the nomination on the condition that it would not interfere with her N.A.A.C.P. work and handily defeated a Republican to become the first black woman elected to the State Senate. She was re-elected that November.         She remained in the job until February 1965, when she was chosen by unanimous vote of the City Council to fill a one-year vacancy as Manhattan borough president. In citywide elections nine months later, she was re-elected to a full four-year term with the endorsement of the Democratic, Republican and Liberal Parties.         As borough president, she drew up a seven-point program for the revitalization of Harlem and East Harlem, securing $700,000 to plan for those and other underprivileged areas of the city.         After becoming a federal judge in 1966, Judge Motley ruled in many cases, but her decisions often reflected her past. She decided on behalf of welfare recipients, low-income Medicaid patients and a prisoner who claimed to have been unconstitutionally punished by 372 days of solitary confinement, whom she awarded damages.         She continued to try cases after she took senior status. Her hope as a judge was that she would change the world for the better, she said.         ''The work I'm doing now will affect people's lives intimately,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977, ''it may even change them.''         Correction:  October 5, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, misstated the given name of her surviving brother and the means by which she was named to fill a vacancy as Manhattan borough president. Her brother is Edward Baker, not Edmund; she took office by a unanimous vote of the City Council members from Manhattan, not of the Council as a whole. The article also misstated part of the name of the civil rights organization that was then the parent of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for which Judge Motley began volunteer work in 1943. It is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- not National Organization.
