        Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         A native of Minneapolis, Mrs. Eiseman began her career in 1945 when her husband, Laurence, packed up some of the dainty, organdy pinafores she made as gifts for friends and took them to a buyer at Chicago's Marshall Field & Company. He came home with a $3,000 order.         Ten years later she became the first children's designer to receive the Neiman Marcus award for her contributions to fashion, an honor that has also gone to Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, James Galanos and Norman Norell. Designs Honored by Museum         Early features of Mrs. Eiseman designs included French seams, hand-sewn hems, bound buttonholes and hand-rolled edges. Among those who dressed their children in her clothes were Princess Grace of Monoco, members of the Kennedy family and Elizabeth Taylor.         In 1964 the Denver Art Museum highlighted her career in a fashion retrospective that is believed to be the first time that a designer of children's wear was so honored by a museum.         ''Florence Eiseman has been one of the most influential figures in the children's fashion industry over the last several decades,'' said Carla Slocum, vice president and merchandise manager of children's wear for Saks Fifth Avenue. ''She was responsible for raising the standards of fashion and quality in better children's wear.''         Mr. Eiseman worked closely with his wife until his death in 1967. Their sons, Robert and Laurence Jr., then shared management with their mother and today are chief executive officer and president of the Florence Eiseman Inc. respectively.         In addition to her sons, Mrs. Eiseman is survived by a sister, Eva Tankel, of Minneapolis, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.         Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.         A graduate of Somerville College at Oxford, Miss Laski published her first novel, ''Love on the Supertax,'' in 1944, and followed it with five others by 1953, including ''The Victorian Chaise-Longue.''         She then turned to criticism, with books on Charlotte Yonge, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Rudyard Kipling and two studies of religious and esthetic experience, ''Ecstasy'' and ''Everyday Ecstasy.''         One of her novels, ''Little Boy Lost,'' was turned into a movie in 1953 that starred Bing Crosby. Her 1959 television play ''The Offshore Island'' was about life in Britain after an atomic holocaust.         Miss Laski was widely known as a radio broadcaster. From 1979 to her death she was a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain, which channels government aid to the performing and visual arts.         Throughout her life, language remained one of Ms. Laski's great passions. Dr. Robert Burchfield, who started editing the four supplements to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1960, said Ms. Laski was his biggest contributor.         She is survived by her husband, John Howard, who founded the Cresset Press, and by a son and a daughter.       
        Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's chief delegate to the United Nations and one of her Government's leading voices on the international scene, died of cancer yesterday in a Managua hospital. Thirty-nine years old, she had been one of the Sandinistas' leading guerrilla heroes in the revolution that overthrew the Somoza regime in         Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's chief delegate to the United Nations and one of her Government's leading voices on the international scene, died of cancer yesterday in a Managua hospital. Thirty-nine years old, she had been one of the Sandinistas' leading guerrilla heroes in the revolution that overthrew the Somoza regime in July 1979.         A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Mission to the United Nations said Miss Astorga returned to Managua in early January because of her illness and was hospitalized Thursday. He said her deputy, Julio Icaza, had been acting in her stead.         Dr. Kevin M. Cahill of New York said he had treated Miss Astorga for breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy in 1986, followed by chemotherapy.         Bourgeois by background and style, Miss Astorga used her Catholic upbringing and legal career as cover for her early role as a guerrilla. She was best known for an operation in 1978 in which she lured Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle's second-in-command into her bedroom, where hidden assailants killed him. U.S. Refused Her as Envoy         Miss Astorga at the time was a corporate lawyer and mother of two. She said later that the Somoza aide, Gen. Reynaldo Perez Vega, was to have been abducted, interrogated and exchanged for 59 political prisoners. But there was a struggle, and the would-be kidnappers slit the general's throat instead, she said.         The general also worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, American and Nicaraguan officials said. The incident loomed large when the United States refused to accept her appointment as Ambassador to Washington in 1984.         After the Sandinista victory, Miss Astorga became chief special prosecutor in 1980 for the trials of 7,500 members of the Somoza regime's National Guard and other supporters of the ousted dynasty. Many of them drew long sentences, but most have been released since.         Miss Astorga then was named Deputy Foreign Minister to represent Nicaragua at international conferences. She also spoke for her country in 1983 and 1984 when the Contadora group of Latin American nation was searching for a peaceful settlement of the civil strife in Central America.         She presented her credentials to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar at the United Nations in March 1986. Her message, sounded often, was meant to counter Washington's charges that the Sandinistas were seeking to impose Marxism-Leninism on all of Central America and to challenge the United States to help resolve the region's conflicts through talks. An Atypical Revolutionary         ''Revolutions are not exportable like Coca-Cola or paperbacks or something like that,'' she told reporters. ''You don't produce it internally and send it away. Revolutions are made in a country when the conditions in that particular country are for a process of change.''         Miss Astorga stood out in her diplomatic surroundings not only as one of the few women in such a position. At 5 feet 11 inches in high heels, she seldom went unnoticed, with her sleek frame fitted in dress-for-success clothes and her hair smartly cropped. She spoke Americanized English as well as Italian and loved classical music - not the typical portrait of a revolutionary.         While at the United Nations, she lived in a six-bedroom house in Scarsdale with her mother and her five children, including an adopted son who was the child of a friend killed in the revolution. All the children attended schools in Westchester County.         Nora Astorga Gadea was the daughter of a wealthy lumber exporter and rancher. The Astorga family - she kept her maiden name - had been associated with the Somoza regime since her grandfather was Defense Minister.         Driven to excel, she studied sociology at Catholic University in Washington before taking her law degree at the Jesuit-run Catholic University in Managua. There she began her secret work for the Sandinistas, passing messages and buying supplies.         At 22, she married Jorge Jenkins, a student dissident, and the couple spent a year in Italy, where he studied archeology and she banking law. They had two children before they parted after five years.         After the Peres Vega killing, Miss Astorga fled to a training camp where she commanded a military squad and became the lover of Jose Maria Alvarado, a member of the Sandinista inner circle, with whom she had two children.       
        Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Best known for her insight into the everyday activities of American women, young and old, and for her studies of life as it was lived in and near Union Square from 1930 until the present day, Miss Bishop was the living continuation of a specific and distinctively American idiom.         That idiom, which was pioneered at the turn of this century by Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, George Luks, John Sloan and others, was reportorial in style, anecdotal in tone and shorn of all extraneous or merely complimentary material. It was intended to seize a moment, tell a tale, and give a renewed dignity to people for whom high art in this country had not often had a place. A Perceptive Observer         On the street corner, in the automat, in the subway and on park benches in fine weather, Miss Bishop proved herself a perceptive observer. For young women in the big city who were as yet unmarked by life, she had a particular feeling. But she was alert to the potential both for happiness and for an irrevocable, untold misery that exists at every stage of metropolitan life.         For all the rapid, spontaneous, firsthand qulity of her observation, she knew how to reach back into European Old Master painting for support and encouragement. John H. Baur, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, once said of her work that ''in some mysterious manner which I do not really understand, her paintings carry forward the great tradition of north European 17th-century figure painting.''         Miss Bishop cherished that connection, and once said that ''you may have true gifts and the ability to make something that is new and surprising, but if your work hasn't any connections and your gift gives out, you haven't any leverage.'' Optimistic Viewpoint         When she first came to New York in the early 1920s, determined to become an artist, Miss Bishop studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois, both of whom had studied with Robert Henri.         From Pene du Bois, and later from her close friend, the painter Reginald Marsh, Miss Bishop learned to sharpen and perfect her sense of a New York subject. But neither age nor familiarity ever eroded her inherently optimistic approach to life. In her late work, it was as apparent as ever she had an unsentimental confidence that one day, somehow, the lot of women in the city would be changed for the better, Miss Bishop was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 3, 1902, the daughter of John Remsen Bishop, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Anna Bartram Bishop. Her father moved his large family from Princeton to the Midwest in hopes of giving them a more comfortable life. The failure of this venture, and the experience of genteel poverty in Detroit, gave her a lifelong sympathy with underprivileged people. Moved to New York in 1918         In 1918 she moved to New York and studied at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. Shortly after leaving the Art Students League in 1924, she began to work in the Union Square area, where she eventually took rank as the unofficial but unquestioned visual historian.         In 1932, she joined the Midtown Gallery in Manhattan, with which she remained closely affiliated for the rest of her life. A member of the National Academy of Design since 1941, she was vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters from 1944-46, a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London in 1964, a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971, and the recipient of honorary doctorates at Bates College, Mount Holyoke College and Syracuse University. She also received the gold medal of the National Arts Club in 1968 and 1970, the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts award (presented by President Carter) in 1979, and the gold medal for painting from the National Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1987.         Miss Bishop was married in 1934 to Dr. Harold Wolff, a neurologist. She is survived by a son, Remsen Wolff, and two granddaughters, Sara and Naomi Wolff.

        Heather O'Rourke, familiar to moviegoers as the child swept into another world by ghosts in ''Poltergeist'' and its sequel, ''Poltergeist II,'' died at Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego Monday. She was 12 years old.         Heather O'Rourke, familiar to moviegoers as the child swept into another world by ghosts in ''Poltergeist'' and its sequel, ''Poltergeist II,'' died at Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego Monday. She was 12 years old.         She died as a result of an acute bowel obstruction, complicated by septic shock, said a spokesman for the hospital, Vincent Bond. He said Miss O'Rourke had undergone surgery for the obstruction, which was congenital, after an emergency flight to the hospital from another hospital in the area.         Miss O'Rourke had finished shooting the forthcoming ''Poltergeist III'' last June. A statement by M-G-M, the studio that produced all three films, said her death was unexpected, and the cause ''unknown at this time.''         Steven Spielberg, who co-wrote and co-produced ''Poltergeist,'' discovered Miss O'Rourke by chance when she was visiting the M-G-M studios. After the 1982 film, she appeared in television shows such as ''Webster'' and ''Still the Beaver'' and had a recurring role on ''Happy Days'' as the daughter of Henry Winkler's girlfriend. She played a blind girl on a recent episode of ''Our House.''         But she was most memorable in her debut film, in which she played a key role as the youngest child of a suburban family. With her wide eyes, long blonde hair and soft voice, she was so striking that the sequel played off her presence. Her slight voice, eerily singing ''They're baaack!'' to announce the ghosts' return, became the tag line in the film's advertising.         She is survived by her parents, Katherine and Jim, of San Diego.       
        Anne-Marie Goelet, who was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor for her services in World War II, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and also lived in Newport, R.I.         Anne-Marie Goelet, who was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor for her services in World War II, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and also lived in Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Goelet, a native of France, was honored by France for aiding French-American wives during the war and for providing medical services to inhabitants around Sandricourt, the Goelet family estate outside Paris, after the capital's liberation in August 1944.         Mrs. Goelet's husband, Robert Walton Goelet, a New York landowner, died in 1941. Among his holdings were the old Ritz-Carlton Hotel and its site at 46th Street and Madison Avenue and the site occupied by the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue between 52d and 53d Streets.         Surviving are three sons, Robert and John, of Manhattan, and Francis, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Beatrice Manice of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

Olive Carey, an actress and the wife and mother to a pair of famous Harry Careys, died Sunday at her home. She was 92 years old.         Olive Golden was born on Jan. 31, 1896, into a performing family headed by her father, George Fuller Golden, a vaudeville entertainer.         The actress appeared on screen with Harry Carey, her future husband, in the 1914 silent movie ''The Sorrowful Shore.'' She later worked with the director D. W. Griffith and made several films with John Ford, John Wayne, her husband and their son, Harry Carey Jr. When her husband died in 1947, Mrs. Carey came out of retirement to act in such films as ''The Searchers,'' ''The Alamo'' and ''Two Rode Together.''         In addition to her son, she is survived by a sister, Mignonne; a daughter, Cappy Carey; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Suzy Frelinghuysen, a former opera singer and a painter whose work is increasingly recognized by collectors and museums, died of a stroke on Saturday in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         Suzy Frelinghuysen, a former opera singer and a painter whose work is increasingly recognized by collectors and museums, died of a stroke on Saturday in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         An admirer of Juan Gris and Georges Braque, Ms. Frelinghuysen was best known for her paintings and collages of the 1940's, done in a synthetic Cubist style reminiscent of theirs, but with the formal elements manipulated in a highly personal manner. Ms. Frelinghuysen recently sold a work to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Born to a socially prominent New Jersey family in 1912, she was named Estelle Condit Frelinghuysen, but preferred the nickname Suzy, bestowed by her brothers. She attended Miss Fine's School in Princeton, and then studied voice. She married the abstract painter George L. K. Morris in 1935 Under the name of Suzy Morris, she won considerable acclaim for several seasons as a soprano with the City Center Opera, making her debut in ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' in 1947.         Ms. Frelinghuysen, whose husband died in 1975, is survived by a brother, Griswold Frelinghuysen, of Vermont.       
        Mathilde Pincus, a leading music-preparation supervisor for the New York theater, died on Saturday in Dania, Fla., after a brief illness. She was 71 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Dania.         Mathilde Pincus, a leading music-preparation supervisor for the New York theater, died on Saturday in Dania, Fla., after a brief illness. She was 71 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Dania.         Miss Pincus received a special Tony Award in 1976 in recognition of her services to the Broadway musical. As a music copyist - a term she disliked because it failed to convey the scope of her contribution - she worked on the orchestration of more than 150 Broadway shows, as well as Off Broadway productions and scores for commercial films, documentaries, television shows and commercials.         Miss Pincus grew up in Philadelphia, where she studied music and played the viola. She took up her career almost by accident. ''At one time, there was illness in the family and we needed extra money, so I did occasional music copying,'' she once recalled. ''One thing led to another.''         Miss Pincus left no immediate survivors. Funeral services will be held today in Philadelphia.       
        Camilla Ravera, a founder of the Communist Party in Italy and a champion of women's rights who became the first woman elected to the Italian Senate, died Thursday at her Rome apartment, her family reported. She was 98 years old.         Camilla Ravera, a founder of the Communist Party in Italy and a champion of women's rights who became the first woman elected to the Italian Senate, died Thursday at her Rome apartment, her family reported. She was 98 years old.         Miss Ravera helped found the party in 1921 but was expelled in 1943 because she bitterly criticized Stalin and the nonaggression pact of 1939 between the Soviet Union and the Nazis.         She was reinstated during the 1950's and was elected to the Senate in 1982.         She was one of just nine people given the honorary title of senator for life and remained active in Italian politics through 1983.         In 1930, she was arrested for anti-Fascist activities and sentenced to 15 years in prison by a special tribunal. She served five years in jail and eight in internal exile before being freed after the Allied invasion of Italy.         In Parliament, Miss Ravera sought to extend women's rights, and she wrote a history of the women's movement in Italy.         Miss Ravera was a close friend of former President Sandro Pertini, a Socialist, who nominated her as senator for life.         A group of students visiting the presidential mansion once asked Mr. Pertini if he thought a woman could hold his post. ''Why not,'' President Pertini replied. ''One Camilla Ravera is an example.''

Carol Collins Tofel, director of administration at the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy in Manhattan, died yesterday after a long illness at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 54 years old.         Mrs. Tofel, before joining the institute in 1980, was administrator of the Ethical Culture Schools.         Mrs. Tofel, a graduate of Skidmore College, also served on the board of the Barnard School in New York from 1968 to 1977.         She is survived by her husband, Robert; two sons, Richard and Lawrence, and a granddaughter, all of New York.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Mystery in Sculpture         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left.         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. By JOHN RUSSELL         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 89 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Known for Wall Sculptures         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's and was shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window.

Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. Constant Change, Constant Work         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's, and shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she later said of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built an Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition, not just a ''show,'' but a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture as Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Government in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters and two great-granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Carolyn Ann Franklin, a singer and songwriter, died of cancer on Monday. She was 43 years old.         Carolyn Ann Franklin, a singer and songwriter, died of cancer on Monday. She was 43 years old.         Among Miss Franklin's compositions were ''Gotta Find Me an Angel'' and ''Ain't No Way,'' both made into million-record sellers by her sister, Aretha.         She also arranged ''Take Another Little Piece of My Heart'' by Erma Franklin, another sister and singer, a song later made popular by Janis Joplin.         Miss Franklin was born in Memphis and moved with her family to Buffalo and then to Detroit in 1946. As a child, she formed a singing group with members of the young people's choir at the New Bethel Baptist Church, where her father was the pastor.         She, Erma and their cousin, Brenda Bryant, sang background on Aretha Franklin's early records.         She is survived by her sisters, her grandmother and two brothers.       
        Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Judge Matthews was named to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by President Truman in 1949. At the time of her nomination, she was a familiar figure in Washington as a lawyer for the National Women's Party and an active campaigner for women's rights.         Judge Matthews presided over a number of major trials, including the 1957 bribery trial of James R. Hoffa, then vice president of the teamsters' union, at which he was acquitted. Help From Friends in Senate         She recalled in an interview several years ago that her friendship with a number of senators had blunted opposition to the notion of a woman on the Federal bench. When her nomination was being considered, one of the judges on the district court, T. Alan Goldsborough, said publicly that while ''Mrs. Matthews would be a good judge,'' there was ''just one thing wrong: she's a woman.''         While Judge Goldsborough told her some years later that his opposition had been mistaken, she received an icy welcome from her fellow judges, who agreed among themselves to assign her all the ''long motions,'' the most technical and least rewarding part of the court's docket.         Judge Matthews never retired from the court. In 1968 she took senior status, permitting her to reduce her workload on the district court while also hearing occasional cases in other Federal courts in Washington. She sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. She continued hearing district court cases until five years ago.         Judge Matthews retained a strong sense of her own role as a pioneer, and never wavered in her commitment to expanding opportunities for women. In a 1985 interview with the Third Branch, a newsletter published by the Federal court system, she said she had always chosen women to be her law clerks.         ''The reason I always had women,'' she said, ''was because so often, when a woman makes good at something they always say that some man did it. So I just thought it would be better to have women. I wanted to show my confidence in women.''         Burnita Shelton decided as a young girl that she wanted to be a lawyer, although professional opportunities in the law were extremely limited for women. She was born Dec. 28, 1894, in Copiah County, Mississippi, where her father owned a plantation and served as clerk of the local chancery court. She often accompanied him to court. But while the family sent her brother to law school, she was sent to the Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati, where she studied voice and piano.         She was teaching piano when the United States entered World War I. Hoping to find a Government job that would enable her to go to law school at night, she moved to Washington, passed a Civil Service examination, and took a job with the Veterans Administration. She went to night school at National University Law School, which later became part of George Washington University.         After her graduation in 1919, Mrs. Matthews, now married to a lawyer, Percy A. Matthews, applied to the Veterans Administration for a job as a lawyer. When the agency told her that it would never hire a woman in the legal department, she opened her own law office. More Obstacles to Legal Career         There were other stumbling blocks as well. The local bar association refused to accept her application for membership, returning the check she had sent for membership dues. Judge Matthews included that check among the papers she donated to what is now the Burnita Shelton Matthews Collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, at Radcliffe College.         Her activities on behalf of women's rights began in law school. In 1919, she was among several dozen women who regularly picketed the White House on Sundays on behalf of women's suffrage. ''You could carry a banner,'' she recalled in the 1985 interview, ''but if you spoke, you were arrested for speaking without a permit. So when they asked me why I was there, I didn't answer.''         After women got the vote in 1920, she shifted the focus of her activities. She became the lawyer for the National Woman's Party, which was trying to persuade state legislatures to lift legal barriers to women. Mrs. Matthews researched state laws and drafted proposed bills. The National Woman's Party owned the property across the street from the Capitol where the Supreme Court's building is now located. In the 1920's, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft proposed acquiring the land for the Court, she went to the Chief Justice's home to try to persuade him to look elsewhere. Her efforts failed, but she represented the party in the condemnation proceedings and won a generous settlement for it.         In the 1940's she also taught at the Washington College of Law, now part of American University. Upheld Right of Black Muslims         In 1949, President Truman named her to one of 20 new district judgeships that Congress had created to relieve a backlog in district court dockets. Among her rulings was one upholding the right of Black Muslims in the local prison to conduct religious services.         In a 1955 case, she refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer Paul Robeson, who was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and of supporting various pro-Communist activities, . Mr. Robeson's passport was withheld from 1950 to 1958 and was restored to him when, in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled the State Department's action unconstitutional.         On the Court of Appeals, Judge Matthews ruled that the Social Security Administration could not cut off disability benefits without a hearing.         In 1984, President Reagan commended her for her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit.''         Her husband died in 1969. They had no children. Judge Matthews is survived by four sisters-in-law and 11 nieces and nephews. She will be buried in the family cemetery in Copiah County, Mississippi.       
        Gertrude Soule, a Shaker leader whose storytelling helped visitors understand a rapidly disappearing religious community, has died at 93, leaving only two Shaker women in their 90's in the state.         Gertrude Soule, a Shaker leader whose storytelling helped visitors understand a rapidly disappearing religious community, has died at 93, leaving only two Shaker women in their 90's in the state.         Richard Kathmann, director at Shaker Village, said today that Miss Soule died in her sleep over the weekend.         Miss Soule's death leaves Sister Ethel Hudson, 92, and Eldress Bertha Lindsay, 90, as the last Shakers in a community that once numbered 400 men, women and children.         Miss Soule was born in Topsham, Me. At age 11, she and her sister were placed with the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Me., after the death of their mother. Chose to Remain         She chose to remain with the community when she turned 21 and signed the Shaker vow of celibacy. In the early 1950's, she became an eldress, or spiritual leader, of the Sabbathday Lake Society. In 1957, she was appointed to the Lead Ministry of the United Society of Believers.         She moved to Canterbury Shaker Village in 1972 to assume further responsibilities as a member of the Lead Ministry and served as vice president of the nonprofit educational corporation and museum that administers the historic site founded in the 1780's.         Miss Soule frequently told stories to the children visiting the museum. Her favorite was about an orphaned seal pup she helped raise when she lived with her father. They kept the seal in the family bathtub.         Famous for their simple, efficient creations, including the flat broom, clothespin and ladderback chairs, Shakers once numbered 6,000 at 24 communities throughout the country.         Now, the villages in Canterbury and Sabbathday Lake are the only ones with living Shakers. There are five undisputed shakers in Maine, and others admitted as new members. The Canterbury village has admitted no new members since 1965.         Services for Miss Soule will be held Tuesday at the Dwelling House Chapel at the village, Mr. Kathmann said.

        Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920's and 30's and the lifetime companion of the playwright Luigi Pirandello, died after suffering a stroke on her 88th birthday Friday in a Milan nursing home, her family announced today.         Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920's and 30's and the lifetime companion of the playwright Luigi Pirandello, died after suffering a stroke on her 88th birthday Friday in a Milan nursing home, her family announced today.         Miss Abba entered Milan's drama school when she was 15 and began her career in 1923 with the stage company of the director Ettore Paladini. She drew acclaim the following year in Virgilio Talli's production of Anton Chekhov's ''Gabbiano.''         In 1925, she became the lead actress for Pirandello, the ground-breaking dramatist whose work often focused on the thin line between illusion and reality. Pirandello, who was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature, is considered by many to be one of the great writers of the 20th century European theater. Toured Together         After spending years in Rome performing such Pirandello plays as ''Six Characters in Search of An Author,'' the playwright and Miss Abba went on tour in Italy and abroad, including the United States, France, Britain and Germany.         Pirandello wrote several plays specifically for Miss Abba, including ''As You Desire Me'' in 1930.         In 1928-29, Miss Abba formed her own company of young actors, mostly performing plays of her mentor. In the 1930's, she expanded her repertory to include Shakespeare, Shaw and others. Married After Playwright's Death         Pirandello died in 1936. Two years later, Miss Abba married an American, S. A. Millikin, grandson of a Cleveland steel baron. She retired and settled in the United States.         After the marriage broke up, she moved back to Milan in 1953, returning briefly to the stage with a company in her own name.         She served on the board of the Institute of Pirandello Studies and Contemporary Italian Theater since 1962.         Two years ago, Miss Abba donated to Princeton University the 560 letters that Pirandello had written her.         Funeral services for Miss Abba are scheduled Monday in Milan.       
        Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Eleanor Estes, a prolific author of children's books, died of complications following a stroke at the Whitney Manor Nursing Home in Hamden, Conn., on Friday. She was 82 years old and lived in New Haven.         Mrs. Estes was born in West Haven. She graduated from the Pratt Institute Library School and worked as children's librarian in branches of the New York Public Library system.         Her first book was ''The Moffats,'' written in 1941 and an instant hit. It illustrated the life of a family of four children growing up in a small New England town. Two other books about the Moffats followed.         The most popular of her 19 books, many of which she illustrated herself, was ''The Hundred Dresses,'' a tale about a poor child who is ridiculed for her tattered clothing and who insists that she owns 100 dresses. They turn out to be drawings, and when they win a prize, the girl's tormentors are abashed - and perhaps reformed. Won a Newbery Medal         Mrs. Estes won several literary prizes, the most prestigous being a John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished children's book, in 1952 for ''Ginger Pye.''         She was once asked by The New York Times Book Review what she was trying to say to children. She replied: ''I am holding up a mirror, and the scene reflected in the mirror is a true image of childhood, and the mirror, besides reflecting, also speaks and echoes the clear, profound, unpremeditated utterances, thoughts and imageries of children. I like to make children laugh or cry, to be moved in some way by my writing.''         Mrs. Estes wrote a single adult novel, ''The Echoing Green,'' which never achieved the popularity of her children's works.         She is survived by her husband, Rice, and a daughter, Helena Sileo of Brooklyn.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Lucille S. Hurley Thompson, a nutrition scholar whose research linked some dietary deficiencies of expectant mothers with birth defects, has died at age 66.         Lucille S. Hurley Thompson, a nutrition scholar whose research linked some dietary deficiencies of expectant mothers with birth defects, has died at age 66.         The professor at the University of California at Davis died Thursday morning in a Sacramento hospital after open-heart surgery.         Beginning in the 1950s, she studied the effects of the trace metals manganese, zinc, magnesium, iron and copper on fetal development.         In her career, she received two Guggenheim Fellowships, five visiting scholar appointments abroad and numerous nutrition research awards. She served on several committees of the National Institutes of Health and the National Academy of Sciences national research council.         She was named editor of the Journal of Nutrition in 1984 and had served as president of three national scientific organizations.         Known professionally as Dr. Hurley, she was born in Riga, Latvia, and immigrated to the United States with her family at age of 3.         She is survived by her husband, Kenneth Thompson of Sacramento; a daughter, Barbara Jungerman of San Francisco; a son, Michael Hurley of Shingle Springs, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Tamara Wright of Seattle; stepsons, Nicolas Thompson of West Sacramento and Marcus Thompson of San Jose; a brother, Dr. Milton Shapson of Milwaukee; a sister, Phyllis Shapson of Los Angeles; and two grandsons.       
        Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, having suffered a second stroke a month ago. She had a first stroke in 1984.         ''We shall miss her very much but she had been very ill for some time,'' Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said today.         In the 1970's and early 1980's, millions of dog owners in Britain and the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on the BBC television program ''Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way,'' which became widely syndicated in this country. Before long, loyal viewers were telling their dogs, ''Walkies!'' as her byword caught on. With Love and Breath         Her book, ''No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a bestseller in 1982.         She insisted that any dog could be trained and showed that they could be taught within minutes with ''tone of voice, telepathy and a little bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to breathe into its nose.         Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In 1980, she was ''flabbergasted'' to be named female television personality of the year in Britain.         ''She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr. Michael Woodhouse, said.         The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north of London.         The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knack with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice. Innkeeper for Man and Beast         She trained dogs as her three children were growing up, and at one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.         She made her first dog-training film, ''Love Me, Love My Dog,'' in 1955 using a Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theaters around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance sales of 25,000.         Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when the television program was running.         She once said that because of the television appearances, she could not go out in public without being asked for her advice.         The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going through passport control at a London airport, the inspector said: ''Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''

        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.

McFarland, who was ac tive until two years ago in the manage-ment of Sweets seafood restaurant, a family business at Fulton and South Streets, died of cardiac arrest Sunday at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, N.J. She was 91 years old and lived in Caldwell, N.J.         Mrs. McFarland was a daughter of James Lake, who in 1917 acquired Sweets, the oldest seafood house in New York City, founded by Abraham M. Sweet in 1842. Her sister, Lea Lake, died in April at 89 after having been a co-owner of Sweets since 1933, when their father died.         Mrs. McFarland was involved with the restaurant in childhood but was associated for several decades with Ohrbach's specialty store. In 1962, after her retirement there, she rejoined Sweets. She worked there until two years ago, when she was severely injured by an intruder at the restaurant during the victory parade in lower Manhattan for the New York Mets, who had won the World Series.         Mrs. McFarland is survived by two sons, John, of East Hanover, N.J., and Benjamin, of Andover, N.J.; five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
        Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Hazel Dawn, a celebrated singer and actress in the early decades of the century who was known as ''The Pink Lady,'' died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Dawn made her Broadway stage debut in March 1911 in an imported musical called ''The Pink Lady.'' The show was a hit, running for three years, and although she was not the leading lady Miss Dawn skyrocketed to fame.         She was once the mascot of both Army and Navy at one of their annual football games. And Miss Dawn said that when West Point's cadets tossed their hats onto the stage, one hat belonged to a cadet who later became President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career Began in London         Miss Dawn began her career in London musical comedies and appeared in ''The Dollar Princess'' and ''Dear Little Denmark,'' as well as ''The Pink Lady.'' In New York, Victor Herbert is said to have written ''The Debutant'' for her and she had roles in ''Up in Mabel's Room'' and ''The Demi-Virgin.'' Although she was an exceptional beauty, most of her roles were not starring ones.         Hazel Dawn was born in Ogden, Utah, and named Hazel Tout. Her family later moved to Wales, where her father, a Mormon, was a missionary. In London, according to one version of how she got her name, a producer, Ivan Caryll, met her at a party and said: ''You're just the one I want for my new play. But you must change your name. Tout is honest but impossible. You are so young, so fresh, so pink, you remind one of the dawn; you shall be Hazel Dawn.''         Miss Dawn starred in the original ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and appeared in early silent films of the Famous Players, among whom were Marion Davies and Margaret Clark. Married Into Wealth         In 1927, Miss Dawn married Charles Gruwell, a mining engineer from Montana, reportedly ''one of the richest men in the West,'' and largely gave up her career, though she did appear on stage in ''Wonder Boy'' in 1931. After Mr. Gruwell died in 1941, she went to work in the casting department of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, retiring from there about 25 years ago. She also appeared in 1946 in the film ''Margie.''         Miss Dawn is survived by her daughter, Dawn Gruwell Kaufman, and her son, Charles E. Gruwell, both of New York, five grandsons and seven great-grandchildren.

Italtel, formally Italtel Societa Italiana Telecomunicazione, is the 34th largest company in Italy, according to reports, and one of several telecommunications operations in that nation.         When she took over, losses were more than $215 million a year. She cut the losses in half in 1982 and then returned it to profitability, where it has remained under her direction.         She wrote her own life story in the book ''Woman and Top Manager,'' frequently worked 12-hour days, but refused to work weekends in order to spend the time with her husband, Lionello Cantoni, a mathematics professor.         ''Maybe I can show young girls that you can make it and still be a normal woman, with normal attitudes toward your family or husband,'' she said.         Before joining Italtel, Miss Bellisario was president and chief executive of Olivetti of America. She joined the company in 1972 and became director of corporate planning and then director of the Distributed Data Processing group.         She became the head of product and operations planning at General Electric Information Systems Italia in 1965 and kept that post when the electronics division was acquired by Honeywell Information Systems Italia in 1969.         Miss Bellisario, an economics graduate of Turin University, began her business career in Olivetti's computer division in 1960.

She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and London.         As Bonita Granville, the actress was the epitome of malevolent little girls, particularly in ''These Three,'' Lillian Hellman's heterosexual film adaptation of her play about lebsianism, ''The Children's Hour.'' The performance won the actress a 1936 Oscar nomination.         Among her more than 50 other movies were ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Maid of Salem'' (1937), ''Quality Street'' (1937), ''Now Voyager'' (1942) and ''Hitler's Children'' (1943).

        A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.         A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.         The Queen, an Egyptian, was married to the young Farouk in 1939. The wedding, carried out accordina to strict Islamic custom at the time, was held in her absence, though with great fanfare and pageantry. After the wedding, she was renamed Farida in accordance with the tradition that all members of the royal family have the same initial.         In 1948, Farouk divorced her after she had given birth to three daughters but failed to produce a male heir. The divorce aroused both great interest and antipathy in the West, both because of Farida's youth and beauty and because the King was regarded by many as the personification of a corrupt old order.         At the same time as Farida was divorced, King Farouk's sister, Queen Fawzia, described in the press as one of the world's most beautiful women, was divorced by the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.         In 1952, Farouk was deposed in a military coup led, among others, by then-Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser. He died in exile in Italy in 1965.         The former Queen lived most of her life in Paris with her three daughters. An artist, she returned to Cairo to live in 1974.       
        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         As Lois W., she was revered as ''the first lady of Al-Anon,'' and as a living reminder of the beginnings five decades ago of the Alcoholics Anonymous self-help movement.         Al-Anon members help one another and themselves to deal with personal problems by speaking about them -''sharing their experience, strength and hope,'' as they like to say - at group meetings. They also help each other on a one-to-one basis, and they read the movement's many inspirational pamphlets and books. Thousands of Groups Formed         An executive on the staff of the Al-Anon Family Group headquarters in Manhattan, where Mrs. Wilson's death was announced yesterday, said 30,000 groups - including several thousand Alateen groups for the teen-age children of alcoholics - are in operation.         The executive, who in accordance with Al-Anon policy declined to give her name, said more than 20,000 of the groups were in the United States and Canada, with groups in about 100 other nations. She estimated worldwide membership of Al-Anon at about 500,000.         In the 1930's, Mrs. Wilson - a spirited, small woman with lively brown eyes - stuck by her alcoholic husband, William G. Wilson, who had become a self-described ''hanger-on in Wall Street.'' She hoped he would manage to stop drinking for good.         Mr. Wilson did, and in 1935 he became a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of its groups flourished in the Wilsons' home, then an apartment at 182 Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Since those early days, Alcoholics Anonymous has grown to an international membership of more than 1.5 million. Known within that organization as Bill W., Mr. Wilson died in 1971. A Time of Discontent         After Alcoholics Anonymous was founded, Mrs. Wilson became discontented. ''It seemed I saw nothing of the man I had tried to help,'' she later recalled.         ''He was always with his A.A. cronies'' who helped him to resist alcohol, she said, adding that ''I guess I was jealous and resentful that these strangers had done for him what I could not do.''         A turning point for her came one day when, as she said, ''I threw my shoe at him as hard as I could.''         ''I was so ashamed of myself,'' she said, ''that I went out and walked around the block several times. I soon had to admit that I needed some therapy myself.''         Mrs. Wilson, who was not an alcoholic, began applying to herself the same self-help principles that her husband and his Alcoholics Anonymous friends were using.         ''I shared my experience with other relatives of alcoholics, and we began to hold informal meetings,'' she said. ''We did not discuss our alcoholic relatives, but tried to straighten out our own lives. This attitude became basic to Al-Anon.'' Two Separate Organizations         Though Al-Anon is in many ways patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous, the two organizations are organizationally separate. Both groups are self-supporting; they do not accept funds from nonmembers. Members of both groups are supposed to maintain anonymity in the news media - which is why Mrs. Wilson and her husband were widely known only by their first names.         Mrs. Wilson was said never to have voiced blanket condemnation of the drinking of alcoholic beverages, affirming that she opposed ''only the disease of alcoholism and the damage it does to a family.''         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a physician. She graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, worked in a Y.W.C.A. and taught school in Short Hills, N.J., before her marriage to Mr. Wilson in 1918. After her marriage she worked for a time as an occupational therapist, wrote magazine articles and worked as a Macy's sales clerk.         After Mrs. Wilson and other alcoholics' relatives began their meetings, similar self-help discussion groups for members of alcoholics' families were founded elsewhere in the United States during the 1940's. In 1951, Mrs. Wilson, along with a friend and Westchester County neighbor, Anne B., set up a central information center for these groups. The center was initially in her Westchester home. First Alateen Group         Not long afterward, the center moved into offices in Manhattan, and the movement took the name Al-Anon Family Groups. In 1957, the first Alateen self-help group was set up, in California, for young people with alcoholism in their families.         Mrs. Wilson remained active and prominent in Al-Anon into the 1980's, traveling on its behalf and appearing at and addressing Al-Anon gatherings. At the first international convention of Al-Anon, in 1985 in Montreal, an audience of 45,000 -members of Alcoholics Anonymous as well as Al-Anon - gave her a standing ovation.         Mrs. Wilson wrote an autobiography, ''Lois Remembers,'' first published in 1979.         There are no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements have not yet been set.       
        Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         The reports said Ms. Onassis had been staying with childhood friends at an exclusive country club outside the Argentine capital. Her father, Aristotle Onassis, laid the foundation of his self-made fortune in shipping, real estate and high finance in Argentina and was a dual citizen of that country and Greece.         Mr. Onassis died in 1975 in France and his daughter and only surviving child was left in charge of the Onassis Group, with assets then variously estimated at $500 million to $1 billion, most of it in shipping. Forbes magazine, citing a worldwide slump in that industry, reported in 1987 that the figure probably had shrunk to $250 million or less.         Mr. Onassis' two major shipping companies were Springfield Shipping of New York City and Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Onassis gave up her American citizenship. She learned about business and finance in the New York offices of her father, beginning as a 20-year-old secretary. After his death, she gradually strengthened her hold over the Onassis Group, although some questions remained in the late 1970's as to just how much control she exerted and how much she left to day-to-day managers.         One of the world's richest women, Miss Onassis was no stranger to personal misfortune. There was the death of her only brother, Alexander, in a private-plane crash in 1973. She herself went through four much-publicized marriages and divorces. Churchill and Callas         The social life on ''Ari'' Onassis' 325-foot yacht, named Christina, was legendary and included the likes of Winston Churchill and the soprano Maria Callas. In fact, Mr. Onassis was romantically linked with Miss Callas when his own marriage to the former Athina (Tina) Livanos, another shipping heiress, broke up in 1959.         Tina Onassis eventually was remarried to her former husband's arch rival, Stavros Niarchos. And Ari Onassis, in 1968, married Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of President John F. Kennedy, whom he first met in 1963.         Christina Onassis defied her father in 1971 by marrying Joseph Bolker, a millionaire home builder and real-estate man, A divorced father of four, he was 27 years her senior and the union broke up within months, apparently at the insistence of her father.         Her next marriage, strongly promoted by her father, took place shortly after his death. Her second husband was Alexander Andreadis, a Greek shipping and banking heir. It, too, lasted only 14 months.         Miss Onassis' third marriage, in Moscow in 1978 to Sergei Kauzov, a Soviet shipping agent, again made front-page headlines, as did her flight to Greece a few days later and their separation in 1979. Marries Frenchman         She married a French businessman, Thierry Roussel, in 1984 and had a daughter with him, Athina, the following January. They filed for divorce eight months later.         Ms. Onassis was said to have never felt close to her stepmother. Friends in Athens said Mr. Onassis was thinking of divorcing the former Mrs. Kennedy at the time of his death and had intended to limit a divorce settlement to $3 million rather than the $250,000 a year provided in his will.         The reports of a forthcoming divorce were denied by Christina, who in 1977 was said to have made a much more generous multi-million settlement in return for which Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dropped all further claims against the estate.       
        Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of ''Sybil,'' a best-selling book about a woman with multiple personalities, and ''Shoemaker,'' a portrait of a Philadelphia murderer, died of a heart attack yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of ''Sybil,'' a best-selling book about a woman with multiple personalities, and ''Shoemaker,'' a portrait of a Philadelphia murderer, died of a heart attack yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Miss Schreiber, a professor of English and speech at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, first gained renown with ''Sybil,'' her 1973 case study chronicling the life and psychoanalysis of a woman with 16 clinically distinct personalities. The book became a best seller and was turned into a two-part NBC television movie in 1976.         Because of her studies of the psychological origins of criminality, Miss Schreiber became interested in writing about Joseph Kallinger, a shoemaker who killed three people in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. She interviewed him in jail in 1976, saying that a book about the murderer would show that ''it's even more important to prevent the development of psychosis that leads to crime than to get tough with criminals after the event.''         Like ''Sybil,'' the new book by Miss Schreiber provoked considerable controversy. After ''Shoemaker'' was published in 1983, she was sued by the family of one of Kallinger's victims under a so-called Son of Sam law in New Jersey that required that money owed to a criminal or his representatives as a result of his crimes go to the victims. A Superior Court ruled that not only the 12.5 percent promised to Mr. Kallinger but also money earned by Miss Schreiber and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, be paid to the victim's family.         Publishers called the ruling a violation of First Amendment rights of free speech, and an appellate panel reversed the decision, ruling that the law applied only to payments received by the criminal.         Before teaching at John Jay College, Miss Schreiber taught for many years at the New School for Social Research and at Adelphi College. She specialized in children's speech and wrote a 1956 manual for parents called ''Your Child's Speech.'' She was a theater critic in the 1940's and later contributed to many magazines and published several short stories.         Miss Schreiber had no immediate survivors.       
        Janet Kidd, socialite daughter of the first Lord Beaverbrook, the Canadian-born press baron and politician, died on Friday at home in Ewhurst, southwest of London, her family reported today. She was 80 years old. No cause of death was given.         Janet Kidd, socialite daughter of the first Lord Beaverbrook, the Canadian-born press baron and politician, died on Friday at home in Ewhurst, southwest of London, her family reported today. She was 80 years old. No cause of death was given.         As the daughter of the publisher of The Daily Express, she was surrounded by celebrities from childhood, including the likes of Rudyard Kipling and David Lloyd George.         Mrs. Kidd had a lifelong interest in horses, and for more than 20 years was a director of the All-England Show Jumping Ground at Hickstead, outside London. She is survived by two daughters and two sons from her three marriages.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.       
        Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove.         Melanie Kahane, an interior designer whose bold use of color created a new look for homes, died of lung cancer Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old. Miss Kahane, the widow of Ben Grauer, a broadcaster for NBC News, caught the public's eye in 1946, when she designed one of the first colored kitchen appliances, a shiny red stove. In 1949, her design for a black-and-white French provincial bedroom accented with pumpkin-colored furniture became one of the most photographed interiors in magazines and books.         ''She was a great inspiration when I was a student in the 50's,'' said Mario Buatta, an interior designer in Manhattan. ''I remember rooms in pink and orange. It was very distinctive. Her work had guts.''         Miss Kahane (pronounced ka-HAIN) was born in Manhattan. She graduated from the Parsons School of Design and worked as an illustrator of women's clothing. In 1939, she went into business as an interior designer. 'The Ability to Visualize'         She designed light bulbs, hotels, studio apartments and theaters. A client, Anne Windfohr Marion, is the second generation of her family to be a client. ''She did mother's house when I was 15,'' said Mrs. Marion, whose husband, John, is chairman of Sotheby's North America. ''She was very easy to work with, a vital, energetic person.''         Miss Kahane had the ability to charm clients while sticking firmly to her finely honed esthetic of glamour and tasteful pizzazz. ''The decorator has the ability to visualize a finished room before it is begun,'' she said, ''and the strength of character not to deviate from a plan, no matter what the opinion of loving friends and relatives.''         After she married, Miss Kahane transformed her dining room into a library for Mr. Grauer's book collection. Then she moved the dining table back in, creating another much-photographed interior. The couple appeared together on an NBC Radio program, ''Decorating Wavelengths,'' which offered news and advice.         Miss Kahane produced a television documentary on contemporary Scandinavian design. She was on the design committee for the United States Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. In 1959, Miss Kahane traveled to the Soviet Union for NBC to record women's views. Under the aegis of the State Department, she conducted symposiums on textiles in Southeast Asian countries. Book for Children         Miss Kahane was a fellow and former treasurer of the American Institute of Interior Designers, a former president of the Decorators Club and an honorary life member of the American Society of Interior Designers.         She wrote a book for children, ''There's a Decorator in Your Doll House,'' published by Atheneum in 1968. In 1985, she was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame.         Miss Kahane had a wit that was often as sharp as her clothing. In an interview in which she revealed that much of the art in her home had been bought by her husband without consultation, she observed, ''When a man's wife is a decorator, he frequently gets the compulsion to assert himself.''         Her recipe for a happy marriage included two sinks in the bathroom. ''A great meeting place,'' she noted.         Surviving are her daughter, Joan Ebenstein Porter of Pipersville, Pa., and two grandchildren. A memorial will be held Jan. 19 at 10:30 A.M. at the David M. Schwartz Center at Parsons, 560 Seventh Avenue at 40th Street.       
        Daw Khin Kyi, widow of a Burmese independence leader and mother of an opposition leader, died today after a long illness, her family said. She was 76 years old.         Daw Khin Kyi, widow of a Burmese independence leader and mother of an opposition leader, died today after a long illness, her family said. She was 76 years old.         Daw Khin Kyi, whose husband, Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in 1947, was the mother of Aung San Suu Kyi, a Burmese opposition leader.         Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Rangoon in April from exile in London to look after her mother, who had been bedridden since suffering a stroke earlier this year. After returning to Rangoon, Aung San Suu Kyi took a leading role in the pro-democracy demonstrations that swept Burma.       
        Margaret Mee, a botanical artist and explorer of Amazonian rain forests, died in a car accident, her family said Friday.         Margaret Mee, a botanical artist and explorer of Amazonian rain forests, died in a car accident, her family said Friday.         Mrs. Mee was 79 years old. She was killed Wednesday in an auto crash near Seagrave in central England, her family said.         In 1952, she and her second husband, Greville Mee, went to live in Rio de Janeiro. She had recently returned to Britain to open an exhibition of her paintings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in west London.         Mrs. Mee was also in Britain for the publication last month of her diaries, ''In Search of the Flowers of the Amazon Forests,'' and a lecture tour.         Mrs. Mee was born near London and studied art as a child.         She made the first of her 15 Amazon expeditions in 1956 to observe, collect and paint flowers. Her last trip there was in May when she traveled to the Igapo forest on Brazil's Rio Negro to paint the rare, night-blooming Amazonian moonflower.         ''As I stood there with the dim outline of the forest all around, I was spellbound, '' she wrote in her diaries. ''Then the first petal began to move and then another as the flower burst into life,''         Mrs. Mee became a leader in the campaign to conserve the rain forests and protect the forest Indians.         The recently established Margaret Mee Amazon Trust provides scholarships to help Brazilian botanists study in Britain.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Anne Seymour, a stage, film and television actress who also performed in more than 5,000 radio programs, died of respiratory failure Thursday at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. She was 79 years old and lived in Studio City, Calif.         Anne Seymour, a stage, film and television actress who also performed in more than 5,000 radio programs, died of respiratory failure Thursday at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. She was 79 years old and lived in Studio City, Calif.         A New Yorker whose family had been involved in the dramatic arts for seven generations, Miss Seymour began her professional career in outdoor theater in New England in 1928. She got her first job on Broadway in the same year, as an understudy in ''Mr. Moneypenny.'' In her last appearance on Broadway, in 1958, she created the role of Sara Delano Roosevelt in ''Sunrise at Campobello,'' opposite Ralph Bellamy.         In radio, Miss Seymour not only performed but wrote and directed programs between 1932 and 1961. She appeared in practically every memorable radio series broadcast from New York. These included 'Mr. Keene, Tracer of Lost Persons,'' ''Bulldog Drummond,'' ''The F.B.I. in Peace and War,'' ''The Theater Guild of the Air,'' ''Inner Sanctum,'' ''Studio One,'' ''Mr. District Attorney,'' ''Our Gal Sunday'' and ''The Romance of Helen Trent.'' Debut in 'All the King's Men'         In films, Miss Seymour was considered essentially a character actress and a comedienne. She went to Hollywood in 1949 and made her debut as Lucy Stark in ''All the King's Men,'' which starred Broderick Crawford. Miss Seymour's final feature film, ''Shoeless Joe,'' with Kevin Costner, has not yet been released. Her other films include ''Desire Under the Elms,'' ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' and ''Hearts of the West.''         Miss Seymour also worked extensively in television, appearing in shows like ''The Kraft Television Theater,'' ''The Nurses,'' ''Ben Casey,'' ''The Defenders,'' ''Perry Mason,'' ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Cagney and Lacey.''         Miss Seymour is survived by a brother, William Seymour Eckert Jr. of Lombard, Ill.
