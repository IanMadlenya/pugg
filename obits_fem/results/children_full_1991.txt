         Mary Francis Shura Craig, a writer of mystery novels and children's books, died on Saturday at the Loyola University Medical Burn Center in Maywood, Ill. She was 67 years old and lived in Hinsdale, Ill.         She died of injuries suffered in a fire in her apartment on Dec. 13, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Craig, who was a recipient of the Carl Sandburg Literary Arts Award in 1985, was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America last year. She wrote children's books under the name Mary Francis Shura and dozens of adult books and mystery novels under the names M. S. Craig, Mary Francis Craig and Meredith Hill.       
         Ruth McAneny Loud, a former president of the Municipal Arts Society, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after emergency surgery for an ulcer, her daughter, Margaret Faron, said.         Mrs. Loud, a native and lifelong resident of Manhattan, was active in civic affairs for several decades. She was a daughter of George McAneny, who was Manhattan Borough President from 1910 to 1913 and president of the New York City Board of Alderman from 1914 to 1916. She was a graduate of the Brearley School and of Bryn Mawr.         After teaching at Brearley from 1929 to 1946, Mrs. Loud became director of the development office of the Museum of the City of New York. In 1965 she was elected president of the Municipal Arts Society and remained a member of its board of directors until her death.         She was co-author with Agnes Wales of "New York! New York! A Knickerbocker Holiday for You and Your Children" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1946).         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Summit, N.J., Mrs. Loud is survived by a son, Roger, of Lake Placid, N.Y.; a sister, Elisabeth Harrison of Rumson, N.J.; three brothers, Herbert McAneny of Princeton, N.J., Ernest McAneny of New York City and David McAneny of Newtown Square, Pa.; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Allison Moore Coudert, a philanthropist who was active in civic causes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of pneumonia, said her daughter, Allison P. Coudert of Tempe, Ariz.         Mrs. Coudert was a member of the A.S.P.C.A.'s Founder's Society and supported museums and social welfare organizations in New York. She was past secretary of the Child Adoption Service of the Children's Aid Society and had been treasurer of the Oyster Bay Visiting Nurse Association on Long Island for many years. She attended Vassar College and served on the board of the Women's City Club.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Alexis, of McLean, Va.; a sister, Nina Moore Galston of Huntington, L.I.; a granddaughter, and a great-grandson.       
         Princess Ileana of Romania, who was known as Mother Alexandra after becoming a nun, died at midday yesterday in St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, Mother Christophora, abbess of the Monastery of the Holy Transfiguration, said.         An aunt of former King Michael of Romania, she was 82 years old and had been a nun at the monastery, which is a community of nuns of the Orthodox Church in America in Ellwood City in western Pennsylvania, for 22 years.         Mother Alexandra, who founded the convent in 1968 and was its abbess from 1969 to 1980, fractured her hip in a fall there on Jan. 4, entered the hospital that night, suffered a massive heart attack on Jan. 8 and died of heart failure, Mother Christophora said.         She was born Jan. 5, 1909, the youngest of the five children of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Romania, and was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.  Brother Becomes King         Her eldest brother became King Carol II of Romania, and at his behest she was married in her early 20's to Archduke Anton of the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and left Romania. She returned to her homeland in 1940 but was forced to leave in 1948 by the Communist Government.         She eventually came to the United States, carrying an heirloom diamond and sapphire tiara wrapped in a nightgown, and settled in Newton, Mass. She divorced the Archduke, who had served in the German Air Force during World War II, in 1954 and supported herself and her children by giving lectures on such topics as her life, Romania and world peace.         Her second marriage, to Dr. Stefan Issarescu, ended in divorce and then, with her children grown up, she became a nun of the Orthodox Church in the convent of the Protection of the Holy Virgin in Bussy-en-Othe in east-central France before going on to found the convent in Pennsylvania. After retiring as abbess at that convent, she continued an active life there and as a speaker on religious topics around the country.         She traveled to Romania in September, her first visit since 1948, to see the graves of her parents.  Author of Several Books         Her writings include a volume of memoirs, "I Live Again" (1952), and several books on spiritual and religious subjects including "Meditations on the Nicene Creed" (1958).         She is survived by three daughters from her first marriage, Alexandra, who lives in West Germany, and Magdalene and Elisabeth, who live in Austria; and two sons, Stefan, of Detroit, and Dominic, of Venice.         The former King Michael, who was ejected from Romania by the Communists shortly before Princess Ileana, now lives in Geneva.       
         Marion Savage Rosette, a pianist, teacher and composer of children's songs, died at her home in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was 90 years old.         She died of brain cancer, said her daughter, Margot Sohmer of Jackson Heights, Queens.         "Katie the Kangaroo," "City Mouse and Country Mouse" and "The Monkey Who Wanted to Fly" are among the songs by Mrs. Rosette that were familiar to a generation of children who watched the television show "Captain Kangaroo." She also wrote nightclub and music hall material.         She was a native of Baltimore and studied piano at the Peabody Conservatory of Music there. On several occasions, she was the soloist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. She also worked as an accompanist for many dancers, singers and instrumentalists.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two granddaughters, Emily Tai and Olivia Sohmer, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Rhoda Bacmeister, an authority on early childhood education who directed nursery schools and wrote eight books about children, died on Wednesday at All Saints Catholic Nursing Home in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 97 years old and lived in Clemson, S.C.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Bacmeister taught at the Manhasset Bay School in Port Washington, L.I., in the 1930's. In World War II she set up day-care centers in Philadelphia for children of women working in war plants. After the war she was director of the Manhattanville Nursery School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She was a native of Northampton, Mass., and a graduate of Vassar College and the University of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree.

         Susan Karelitz Ginsberg, a lawyer who devoted her career to working with social agencies dealing with the problems of women and children, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lymphoma, said her husband, William R. Ginsberg, a professor of environmental law at Hofstra University Law School.         Mrs. Ginsberg was a past president of the Women's Prison Association and Home, Inc., an organization that helps female ex-offenders rejoin society.

         Corinne Prevost Abel, a volunteer active in civic causes around the world, died last Friday in Colwell, England. She was 66 years old and lived in Palo Alto, Calif.         Her husband, Elie Abel, former dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said she had been in a deep depression and had taken her own life. Mr. Abel was conducting a seminar in England.         A graduate of the University of Maryland, Mrs. Abel was a docent at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and a volunteer at Stanford Medical Center.

         Katinka Loeser, many of whose short stories were infused with what a critic described as "autobiographical sketches of warmth and charm," died Wednesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Westport.         She died of kidney failure, said her daughter, Jan DeVries.         Miss Loeser published three collections of stories, most of which first appeared in The New Yorker: "Tomorrow Will Be Monday: Stories of Parents and Children" (1964); "The Archers at Home" (1968), about a suburban couple afflicted with empty-nest syndrome, and "A Thousand Pardons" (1982), stories about a Westport couple who enjoy their lives and the changing seasons.         Miss Loeser was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on July 2, 1913, and grew up in Chicago. She started writing poetry when she was 14. In 1943 she won the Young Poet's Prize of Poetry magazine, and her poems later appeared in The New Yorker. She was notified of the Young Poet's Prize in a telegram from the editor of Poetry, the humorist Peter DeVries, whom she married later that year.         In an interview in 1982, Miss Loeser maintained that it is more difficult to write short stories and poetry than novels. With a poem, she said, "You're thinking in abstract terms and trying to get a rhythm." In a novel, she added, "There is more leeway." But to be a successful writer of any kind, she added, "you have to be a decent reader from the time you're small."         At the University of Chicago, from which she graduated in 1936, Miss Loeser studied under the playwright Thornton Wilder, one of her favorite teachers. When she taught a writing class at the Westport Division of Continuing Education in the 1970's, she adopted the Wilder method of reading his students' stories out loud, anonymously, and having the other students critique them.         Miss Loeser is survived by her husband and three children: Jan DeVries of Media, Pa.; Peter Jon, of New York City, and Derek, of Santa Monica, Calif. Another daughter, Emily, died of leukemia in childhood and is remembered in Miss Loeser's story "Whose Little Girl Are You?" and in Mr. DeVries's book "The Blood of the Lamb."       
         Dorothy Kramer, a Long Island church official, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 61 years old and lived in Port Washington.         She died of breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Kramer was active in hospice work in Nassau County and on the Veatch board of governors, the body that decides on charitable contributions for the North Shore Unitarian Universalist Church. She was the church delegate to the International Association of Religious Freedom in California and in the Netherlands.         Mrs. Kramer began teaching in 1966 and retired in 1989 as an elementary and middle-school teacher in the Plainview-Old Bethpage Central School District. She was a past president of the district's local teachers union.         In 1979 and 1980, she developed a curriculum for dyslexic elementary school children for New York State.         Mrs. Kramer is survived by her husband, Donald, a retired procurement officer for the Grumman Aerospace Corporation; two sons, Donald, of Boston, and Theodore Charles of Brattleboro, Vt.; a daughter, Meredith Ann Brown of Harwinton, Conn.; two brothers, Robert G. Schwartz of Exton, Pa., and Louis Schwartz of Buffalo, and four grandchildren.       
         Helen Lee Caldwell, a leading designer of children's clothes in Manhattan for three decades under the name Helen Lee, died on Wednesday at Fort Sanders Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn. She was 82 years old and had lived in Knoxville since 1981.         She died after a series of strokes, a spokesman for the family said.         In 1953 she became the first children's designer to win the Coty American Fashion Critics Award, for her designs for Youngland Inc. The award cited her "significant influence in the development of good taste and charm in children's fashions."  Clothes for Girls and Boys         For the next three decades, Miss Lee designed clothes for infants, girls, boys and teen-agers. She also created designs for Sears, Roebuck & Company; Saks Fifth Avenue; Alyssa, a children's fashion concern, and for her own company, Designs by Helen Lee Inc.         Despite the reputation of English children's clothes as the best in the world, her designs won accolades from critics at a London fashion show in 1962. One of the models, 3-year-old Cathryn Harrison, the granddaughter of the actor Rex Harrison, wore a white eyelet dress sashed with yellow and cried when asked to take the dress off after the showing.         A 1965 showing in Tokyo was received with equal enthusiasm by an international audience.  Designs Shown in Moscow         Miss Lee's designs appeared at the American Fair in Moscow in 1959 and in a dress worn by her granddaughter, Hilary Ball, on the cover of Life magazine in 1959.         As designer and partner of Alyssa, she received a Neiman-Marcus Award in 1958 and the Ethel Traphagen Award in 1970. She retired in the late 1970's.         Miss Lee was born in Knoxville and attended the University of Tennessee before coming to New York, where she studied at the Art Sudents League and at the Traphagen School of Art.         She is survived by a daughter, Jenny Higginbothan Caldwell of Newton, Mass., five grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Mabel Pickford Jenkins, a retired psychiatric social worker in New York City, died on Thursday at the University Village Retirement Center in Tulsa, Okla. She was 98 years old and had lived in Tulsa since 1984.         Mrs. Jenkins, who lived in the New York City area for 60 years, died after a series of strokes, said Beatrice S. Hawkins of Manhattan, a friend.         In 1924 Mrs. Jenkins became the first director of the social service department of St. Phillip's Episcopal Church in Harlem. In 1935 she joined the Bureau of Child Guidance of the New York City Board of Education. In addition to coordinating services for mental-health clinics in the school system, she supervised the training of students from Columbia and Fordham Universities and from Smith College.         In 1962 she retired from the bureau and worked for two years in the children's psychiatric unit of the Jewish Guild for the Blind. Later she worked for the Community Service Society as a part-time counselor for the elderly. She retired for the second time in 1973.         She was born in Virginia City, Mont., and was an alumna of Columbia, Chicago and Howard Universities. She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work.         Mrs. Jenkins is survived by a nephew, Wilton Hines of Tulsa, and several nieces.       
         The Rev. Dr. Marie-Louise Schoelly Sherwin, a psychiatrist and an ordained Episcopal priest, died on Tuesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a funeral home representative said.         Dr. Sherwin graduated from the medical college at the University of Zurich in 1942 and since 1950 had been a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College. She was also affiliated with the Payne Whitney Clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         For more than 30 years, she was a senior psychiatrist with the court system of New York State and dealt with abused children. She had a private practice in Manhattan.         In 1978, after studying at the Institute of Theology at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, she was ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal Church and was affiliated with the French Church of the Holy Spirit. For the last six years, she was a non-salaried priest at the Church of the Holy Trinity on 88th Street in Manhattan.         She is survived by a sister, Odette H. Rauch of Washington.       
         Helen Lacey Haskell, a camp administrator who was active in civic affairs, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She began her career in 1929 as a co-director of Camp Treetops with her husband, Douglas. The coeducational camp was affiliated with the North Country School in Lake Placid, N.Y. In 1948 she became the camp's director, a post she held until she retired in 1969.         She was president of the New York section of the American Camping Association from 1966 to 1968, and a board member of Trail Blazers Camp, which provided camping for disadvantaged children, from 1974 to 1989.

         Lola Popper Kramarsky, former president of Hadassah, the national women's Zionist organization, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kramarsky was president of Hadassah from 1960 to 1964 and was active in the organization for much of her adult life. Her particular concerns were with Youth Aliyah, which rescues and rehabilitates displaced children, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centr in Jerusalem.         She retired from active Hadassah involvement in 1985. At her death she was an honorary vice president of the organization, whose current membership is 385,000.  Owned Noted Art Collection         With her husband, Siegfried, a banker and philanthropist who died in 1961, Mrs. Kramarsky owned an art collection that was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and included works by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Seurat and Gauguin.

The Kramarskys came to the United States from the Netherlands in 1940, aided by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, a family friend who became the first president of Israel.         Mrs. Kramarsky is survived by two sons, Bernard, of Great Neck, L.I., and Werner, of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Sonia Kramarsky of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and three-great grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Olds, a writer and artist of children's books, died on Monday in Sarasota, Fla., where she lived. She was 94 years old.         Miss Olds was the first woman to hold a Guggenheim Fellowship in art.         During the fellowship, she studied art in Paris, where she also trained as a bareback horse rider and performed with the Cirque d'Hiver.         She was born in Minneapolis and came to New York in 1921. During the Depression, she focused on depicting the lives of working people.         Her works were exhibited in solo shows and group shows over five decades, and she is represented in several museums. The largest single collection, 40 of her prints, is at the National Museum of American Art in Washington.

         Louise Dickinson Rich, the author of "We Took to the Woods," a best seller during World War II, died on Tuesday at her daughter's home in Mattapoisett, Mass. She was 87 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Dinah Anderson, said.         "We Took to the Woods" was a witty account of a Thoreau-like existence in a wilderness home in northwestern Maine.         Mrs. Rich was born in Huntington, Mass., and grew up in Bridgewater, where her father was the editor of a weekly newspaper. She met Ralph Eugene Rich, a Chicago businessman, on a Maine canoe trip in 1933 and they married a year later. Mr. Rich died in 1944.         Mrs. Rich wrote a number of books for adults and children, among them "Only Parent" (1953), "Innocence Under the Elms" (1955) and "The Coast of Maine" (1956).

         Sarah Jane Kinoy, a teacher and social worker who was an early leader in the education of children with cerebral palsy, died on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 96 years old and had lived in Manhattan and Tompkins Corners, N.Y.         She died of heart failure, said her son Ernest.         Mrs. Kinoy, a graduate of Teachers College, was a social worker with the American Red Cross during World War I and later taught at the Brooklyn Ethical Culture School and at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         She was a founder of the Brooklyn Community School in the early 1940's and was executive director of the New York Service for Orthopedic Handicapped. At Teachers College she coordinated the special education department for children with cerebral palsy and in the 1950's, in cooperation with the New York City Board of Education, she developed a pilot school for Manhattan children with the disease. She later served as director of services for Cerebral Palsy of Queens.         She is survived by two sons, Ernest, a television writer, of Williamsville, Vt., and Arthur of Montclair, N.J., a Rutgers University law professor; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         When Carol Perkins sat down in the New York Times cafeteria last week, she pulled down her lower lip and exposed two big white blisters. "They're not herpes," she announced, which certainly turned a lot of heads. But that is something she expects.         Ms. Perkins is a model with the Eileen Ford Agency, and her face -- not to mention the rest of her -- is familiar to anyone who shops through the Victoria's Secret catalogue or reads Vogue. Recently, she has been moonlighting at "Penn and Teller: The Refrigerator Tour," playing at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, which is where the blisters come in. Ms. Perkins works with Penn and Teller, the comic magic team, who bill themselves as "a couple of eccentric guys who've learned to do a few cool things," as a fire-eater.         And if the show's opening act is for the children -- a giant refrigerator is dropped directly on top of the two stars -- then the bit called "Burnin' Luv" is the adults' payoff. Ms. Perkins and Penn Jillette perform a hilarious parody of sex by eating fire, after which Ms. Perkins, wearing an impossibly low-cut dress, strikes a match and lights a cigarette directly from Mr. Jillette's mouth.  An Unmodel-like Model         That someone whose face is her livelihood should take such risks is the height of perversity. But looks aside, Ms. Perkins seems nothing like most models. During the entire lunch she never once mentioned the size of her pores, or how many glasses of water she drank before noon, and she told her age, 33, without hesitation. "Why not?" she asked. "I look pretty good for 33."         She said she loved cafeteria food, and had never had a weight problem. And though she skipped the steam table meat, she eagerly ate up a plate of mashed turnips and peas, which she covered in butter, and followed it with a roll, coffee and a cigarette.         She does dress like a model, perfectly pulled together in a dark turquoise Harris tweed jacket, cashmere sweater, Hermes scarf, corduroy pants and a string of pearls. Then she admitted that she bought the jacket in a thrift shop, on what she called a "junkin' " spree.         Since she learned to eat fire last fall, Ms. Perkins said, she has been "burnt really bad." She pointed to her chin, which looked fine. But she insistently rubbed off her makeup, until the maroon shadow of a burn finally appeared.  A Well-Timed Ignition         Isn't this just about the most awful thing that could happen to her         face?         Her fortune? Apparently not. "I'm not real fussy about things like breaking a nail or getting a wrinkle." Yes, but isn't this is a little more serious? "I couldn't work when I got burned," she said, "but I had taken those two weeks off anyway for rehearsal. It took a couple of weeks for the big old scab to fall off."         Mr. Jillette, who is the tall one, with the ponytail, is Ms. Perkins's partner in "Burnin' Luv." He said in a phone interview: "Her chances of being disfigured and landing in the hospital are slim. Eating fire is safer than walking on the street. She got a nickel-sized blister on her chin, that's all."         Isn't she giving Eileen Ford an ulcer? "Not at all," Ms. Perkins said. "She told me she's never had a model go to Broadway before."'         Also, Ms. Perkins said, there is no insurance policy for her face. She said she didn't need one. "When you're learning to eat fire you're fearful and respectful," she said. "But I got confident and kind of cocky about it, and I just wasn't paying attention. I'm back on guard again."         How did she ever get mixed up in all of this? A longtime fan of Penn and Teller, she arranged an introduction through a friend about a year ago. Last fall, when the duo was rehearsing for an NBC television special, Mr. Jillette called her and asked if she could help find a replacement for Isabella Rossellini, for whom he had written the bit, who had just been cast in a movie. They needed someone famous, Ms. Perkins said, to satisfy the network.         "I suggested Lauren Hutton, who's pretty gutsy, Joan Severance and Carrie Fisher," she said. "I called some girls for him but none came through. Then about a week before the special taped they got into a jam. Penn called me and said: 'We're really on our knees. Can you learn to eat fire so you can show whoever it is we get? You can be the understudy.' And I thought, what a cool thing. I live around the corner from the rehearsal place, so I threw on my jeans and left. I was terrified."         But she turned out to be a quick study, and when no one better known was willing to risk her face, she got the job. "She was our absolute last choice," said Mr. Jillette. "She really likes fire eating, which I don't. When she was learning we would scream at her not to really get comfortable, just to look comfortable."         As the act progressed, the two got comfortable with each other as well, and soon found themselves in the gossip columns. What is it like to kiss after eating fire? "What happens is you burp up gasoline," Ms. Perkins said, laughing. "It's pretty gross." How New York Is Unlike Sarasota         But still exciting for a woman who grew up Sarasota, Fla., where the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus spent its winters and was home to the Ringling Brothers Museum and Clown College. As a child, Ms. Perkins said, she performed in the children's Sailor Circus, along with Emmett Kelly's daughter and a daughter of one of the Flying Wallendas. She specialized in tumbling and riding the unicycle.         Since she didn't have to run away to join the circus, she graduated from high school a year early and ran away from it, to New York at the age of 16: "It seemed so alive compared to the resort-town feel in Sarasota, which catered to vacation living. I loved the chaos in New York, the subways and the dirt. I hung out with a musician boyfriend and modeled for a minute at Wilhelmina. But I wasn't mentally prepared for it, until a few years later."         Ms. Perkins says she has a one-year commitment to the Penn and Teller show, which has been extended on Broadway indefinitely. Then, she said, she plans to split her time between New York and Sarasota, where she wants to establish a women's resource center similar to Hope for Housing in New York, which teaches skills to women on welfare, in rehabilitation programs and recently released from prison. She said her family still lives in Sarasota, where her father is a school principal, and her mother is a painter.         But for now, she is still a model and a fire-eater. At a recent weekend performance full of children, a number of them lined up outside after the show to get the stars' autographs. When Ms. Perkins was spotted near the stage door, a small group of prepubescent boys shyly lined up in front of her, programs in hand. Though she had changed out of her costume, the dress she was wearing was equally low cut. And judging from the looks of rapture on those faces as she bent over to sign the Playbills, the fascination with the falling refrigerator was a thing of the past.         She's getting a kick out of it, too. "It's a once in a lifetime opportunity," she said. "If I had tried to plot it out this way it couldn't have happened. And it really is the perfect part-time job. Because I eat fire a lot better than I type."       
         Loretta U. Boyce, an educator who helped create a school for gifted and talented black and Hispanic youngsters in Brooklyn, died on Wednesday at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. She was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said her niece, Roslyn Bacon.         Ms. Boyce joined the New York City public school system in the mid-1950's as a kindergarten teacher at Public School 125. She later became an acting assistant principal, assistant superintendent of schools in District 16 and deputy superintendent of schools in District 32.         In 1976, she was named principal of Intermediate School 383, the Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented, a special school she had envisioned for minority-group children. The school's achievements in reading have consistantly ranked it among the top schools in New York City. She retired in 1989.         She is survived by three sisters, Uldine Garrison, Gwendolyn Hurley and Una James, all of Brooklyn.       
         Harriet Fleischl Pilpel, a lawyer and civil libertarian who was a prominent advocate of women's rights, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Pilpel died of a heart attack, her husband said.         Last Wednesday, she received an award from the New York Civil Liberties Foundation, one of many such awards she had received. At her death she was first vice chairwoman of the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.         Mrs. Pilpel, a frequent guest on the television program "Firing Line" with William F. Buckley Jr., was associated with the Manhattan law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which she joined in 1982. Throughout her career she lectured extensively on freedom of speech and the press, birth control, abortion and related subjects. She also spoke on the status of women and literary and entertainment law.  Served on Rights Panel         In the 1960's, she was a member of the Kennedy and Johnson Commissions on the Status of Women, serving on the committee on political and civil rights. From 1970 to 1978, she was chairwoman of the Law Panel International of Planned Parenthood Federation. She was also a consultant to the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor from 1965 to 1976 and general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union from 1979 to 1986.         She was also general counsel for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and special counsel for Planned Parenthood of New York City. In 1974, she was a founding member of the Women's Forum, an organization of women of achievement and influence from diverse fields.         In 1961, she argued successfully for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America against a suit asking the Supreme Court to rule on Connecticut laws that would have made it a crime to use birth-control devices or for doctors to advise their use. The Court declined 5 to 4 to rule on the laws.         In 1965, Mrs. Pilpel represented Dr. Benjamin Spock in a free-speech suit over whether advertising in his best-seller "Baby and Child Care," violated the public interest. The court ruled against Dr. Spock, who sought to block the ads.         She graduated from Vassar College in 1932 and received a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School in 1933. She received a law degree from Columbia in 1936.         She is survived by her husband, Irvin B. Schwartz, executive administrator for psychiatry at New York Medical College; two children from a former marriage to Robert C. Pilpel, an executive at the Hudson Guild Settlement House, who died in 1987; a daughter, Judith E. Appelbaum, and a son, Robert H. Pilpel, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Juliette Brudney of Cambridge, Mass., and Ruth Frank of Sanibel, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Lou Masey, a writer and researcher, died on April 16 after jumping from a hotel window in Philadelphia. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Masey suffered from manic depression, said her husband, Jack.         She was the author of four children's books published by David McKay. They were "Branislav the Dragon" (1967), "Story of the Steppes" (1968), "The Picture Story of the Soviet Union" (1971) and "Teddy and the Moon" (1972).         After living in the Soviet Union in the mid-60's, she became an editor and researcher at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Center in Washington. In 1984 Mrs. Masey moved to Manhattan, where she was a copy editor for the Macmillan Publishing Company, now Maxwell/ Macmillan, and later for Praeger Publishers.         Besides her husband, who is the president of Metaform Inc., a design concern, Mrs. Masey is survived by a sister, Virginia Olinger of Worthington, Ohio.       
         Jane Cooper Bland, a teacher of art and art appreciation to young children, died on Friday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had an apartment in Greenwich Village.         Mrs. Bland died of heart failure after suffering complications following heart surgery, her family said.         In 1951, while she was with the Museum of Modern Art, Mrs. Bland wrote in The New York Times that it was important "for us art teachers to provide the opportunity for children to express their ideas and feelings with confidence that they will be accepted and respected."         Her work at the museum included holding classes for children and also providing instruction for other teachers.         The other institutions where she taught in New York over the years included the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools. She also held workshops around the country.         Mrs. Bland was born in Boston, grew up in New York, studied at Pratt Institute and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University Teachers College.         Her writings included the book "The Art of Young Children."         Mrs. Bland was the widow of Harry McNeil Bland, an art dealer who died in 1960.         She is survived by a son, John Cooper Bland of Conshohocken, Pa.; five grandchidren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Cooper Bland, a teacher of art and art appreciation to young children, died on Friday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia.

         Clara Leiser, founder of Youth of All Nations, a nonprofit peace organization that grew out of her experience with refugee children in World War II, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her niece, Anita Leiser, with whom she lived.         Miss Leiser began her career as assistant editor and advertising manager of The Wisconsin Journal of Education. In the late 1920's she resigned to take what was to be the first of many trips to Europe in the 1930's.         Moved by events she had witnessed during the rise of Nazism, she sought to ease the adjustment of hundreds of teen-age refugees from fascism, asking them what they missed most. Nearly all answered "friends."         The result, in 1944, was Youth of All Nations, devoted to building understanding among the youth of many countries, races and religious beliefs through a correspondence program.         To show how letters could improve international understanding, Miss Leiser would cite correspondence from a young German boy whose letters revealed his gradual understanding of democratic ideals.         She wrote or edited several books, among them "Skeleton of Justice," with Edith Roper (E.P. Dutton, 1941); "Lunacy Becomes Us," quotations from Hitler and other top Nazis (Liveright, 1939); "Jean de Reszke and the Great Days of Opera" (Minton, Balch, 1934).         A native of Milwaukee, Miss Leiser was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a sister, Gertrude B. Wilde of Milwaukee.       
         Ana Cristina Bozzo, an art teacher at Hunter College High School who spent the last decade organizing the International Art Show for the End of World Hunger, died Monday at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Alexandra Poe, a board member of Artists to End Hunger Inc., the corporation that presented the show.         Working in her living room at night, on weekends and on vacations, Ms. Bozzo, who was born in Buenos Aires, assembled the show by asking noted artists to donate or lend works that represented their vision of a world without hunger.         She ended up with 46 pieces by artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Marisol and Robert Rauschenberg. The exhibition toured 18 cities around the world, starting with a preview in Washington in 1986 and ending in March at El Museo del Barrio in New York City.         The show was not intended to raise money; its goal was to spread the message that the earth has abundant resources to feed everyone. But with Ms. Bozzo's encouragement, local organizations used the show as an opportunity to raise money and educate people about hunger. Ms. Bozzo also inspired students at Hunter to raise money for hunger relief.         Twenty of the works from the show are being auctioned by Sotheby's, and five are to be offered for private sale. Ms. Poe said they are expected to raise about $500,000. Proceeds will be given to the relief organizations God's Love We Deliver, City Harvest, Manos Unidas and Save the Children.         Ms. Bozzo is survived by her husband, Rogelio Chomnalez of Manhattan, and her parents, Manuel and Dora, and a brother, Carlos Antonio, all of Buenos Aires.       
         Marion Vannett Ridgway, who served as an agent for artists and writers for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 88 years old.         She died of pneumonia and vascular disease, said Elizabeth Park, a friend of more than 20 years.         Ms. Ridgway graduated from the Halstead School in Yonkers and studied art and design in Manhattan. For 40 years she operated Marion Ridgway, artist representative, at 299 Madison Avenue in Manhattan and represented commerical artists, photographers and writers for publishers and advertising concerns.         Early in her career, she wrote 11 books for children.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Bennetta Bullock Washington, an educator and a former director of the Women's Job Corps, died Tuesday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 73 years old and lived in Washington.         Dr. Washington, who was being treated for complications from a stroke, died of cardiac arrest, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Imbued with the desire to educate the poor and culturally deprived, Dr. Washington believed that all children, including poor, black, inner-city youngsters, have potential.         The daughter of a prominent Baptist minister, she was the wife of Walter Washington, the first elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. During his tenure, 1967 to 1979, she was regarded as one of his two top advisers.         She began her teaching career in a special school for disturbed youths called Boys Junior-Senior High. She was named principal of Cardozo High School in 1961, where she initiated an academic and work-study program that became a model for the National Teacher Corps.         In 1964 she started a Job Corps program for women, setting up training centers around the country. In 1973 she became an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Labor, specializing in the education, vocational training and counseling of men and women in urban and rural ghettos. She retired in 1981.         Dr. Washington wrote three books about the effects of poverty on the learning process, was a trustee for several colleges and was a member of Presidential committees on youth, hunger and employment of the handicapped.         She graduated from Dunbar High School in Washington and from Howard University, where she receieved her bachelor's and master's degrees. In 1939 she earned a doctorate from Catholic University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Dr. Bennetta Jules-Rosette, an anthropologist, of Leucadia, Calif.; two brothers, Dr. Samuel C. Bullock, of Philadelphia, and Joseph B. Bullock, of Washington; a granddaughter, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Dr. Frances Fuchs Schachter, a child psychologist, died on Thursday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 61 years old.         She died of lung cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Dr. Schachter's primary interest was in developmental psychology, in work with brothers and sisters, language development in young children and parent-toddler relations.         Since 1983, Dr. Schachter had been supervising pediatric psychologist at Metropolitan Hospital and an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at New York Medical College. She also had a private practice in family therapy.         From 1974 to 1982 she was an assistant professor of psychology at Barnard College, and in the early 1970's she was a pychologist at the Bank Street College of Education. In the 1960's, she was a member of the department of child psychiatry at St. Luke's Hospital.         She was the author of "Everyday Mother Talk to Toddlers: Early Intervention" (Academic Press, 1979), and co-editor with Richard K. Stone of "Practical Concerns About Siblings: Bridging the Research-Practice Gap" (Haworth Press, 1987).         Dr. Schachter was born in the Bronx, graduated from Barnard College and received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Rochester. She began her career in 1955 as an instructor at Stanford University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. David Schachter, professor of physiology and cellular biophysics at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; a son, Jonathan, a post-doctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Leah Ann , an intern at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston; her mother, Sadie Fuchs of the Bronx; a sister, Norma Resnick of Woodmere, L.I., and two brothers, Daniel Fuchs of Tenafly, N.J., and Leonard Fuchs of Armonk, N.Y.       
         Wally Toscanini, a daughter of Arturo Toscanini who was known in Italy for her charitable works, died yesterday at the home of her daughter in Rome. She was 91 years old and had lived in Rome in recent years.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her sister, Wanda Horowitz of Manhattan.         One of Toscanini's three children, Walter, Wally and Wanda, she lived most of her life in Milan. She devoted much of her time to raising money for orphaned children throughout Italy and for restoring La Scala, where her father was the principal conductor for many years.         Her marriage to Count Emanuele di Castelbarco in 1931 ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, the widow of the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, she is survived by her daughter, Emanuela Castelbarco, and a grandson.       
         Dr. Marjorie Harley, a psychoanalyst who specialized in treating children and adolescents, died Wednesday at her home in Baltimore. She was 77 years old.         She died of a brain tumor, an associate said.         Dr. Harley, who was born in New York City, received a bachelor's degree at Barnard College and master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. After moving to Baltimore in 1965 she took part in training programs at the Baltimore Institute of Psychoanalysis. She taught psychology, pediatrics and psychoanalytic psychology at Johns Hopkins University.         She was the widow of Dr. Russell Anderson, a psychoanalyst. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Margot Tomes, an artist and illustrator of children's books, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pancreatic cancer, a family friend said.         Miss Tomes was an award-winning illustrator of fairy tales, historical stories in verse for children, songbooks and cookbooks. She illustrated works by Alison Lurie, Jean Fritz, Wanda Gag, Ruth Kraus and Charlotte Zolotow, among others.         The American Library Association listed her work among notable books for children, and the American Institute of Graphic Arts included her work in a 1978-79 exhibition entitled "Communicating With Children." In 1977, "Jack and the Wonder Beans," a book she illustrated, was cited by The New York Times as one of the 10 best children's books of the year. A similar citation was given in 1984 for "If There Were Dreams to Sell."         Miss Tomes began illustrating children's books in 1963 with Barbera Wersba's book "The Brave Balloon of Benjamin Buckley." Most recently she had been illustrating fairy tales like "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," "The Six Swans" and "The Fisherman and His Wife."         She is survived by a sister, Jacqueline Allison of Amagansett, L.I.       
         Candy Jernigan, a painter, sculptor and set designer, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Jed Wheeler.         Ms. Jernigan was known for witty, vivid collagist work that was as much social commentary as art. It incorporated maps, landscapes, rocks and found objects, and it often took the form of one-of-a-kind printed books that included short autobiographical writings. Her work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Albright-Knox Museum in Buffalo, the Bronx Museum and the Boston Children's Museum, as well as several galleries in New York City. Her theater work included sets for John Moran's multi-media opera "The Manson Family" and collaborations with XXY Dance/Music, a multi-media dance company.         Ms. Jernigan is survived by her husband, the composer Philip Glass, a stepdaughter, Juliet, and a stepson, Zachary, all of Manhattan; her mother, Pauline Bauer of Jupiter, Fla., and a sister, Audrey Hart of Key West, Fla.         A memorial service will be held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, on Friday at 1 P.M.       
         Eva Le Gallienne, who as an actress, producer, director, translator, writer and teacher was for many decades one of the grand figures of the American stage, died late Monday night at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 92 years old.         The cause of death was heart failure, said a friend, Anne Kaufman Schneider.         A commanding presence on the stage and a strong-minded director, Miss Le Gallienne was actually a slight and, according to her friends, a shy and private person, her affections being concentrated on her dogs and other pets. In a memoir, she expressed surprise at being called beautiful by critics; she said she thought beauty might be a burden.         She was dedicated to the theater from early childhood, two aunts and an uncle having been successful English actors. She was born in London on Jan. 11, 1899, the daughter of Richard Le Gallienne, a then-famous poet and journalist, and the former Julie Norregard, a Danish journalist. Her parents were divorced when Eva was 4 years old, and she and her mother moved to Paris. Saw Bernhardt Act         There, as a young girl, she saw Sarah Bernhardt act, and was taken backstage to meet the star. The experience was to determine the course of Miss Le Gallienne's own life.         "It made such an enormous impression on me that I thought, 'That's what I'd like to do,' " she said.         Eva was 15 when Constance Collier, a family friend, got her a walk-on role in Maeterlinck's "Monna Vanna" in London. She attended a drama school for a few months, but left for a part as a cockney servant girl in a minor comedy -- and brought down the house.         On the strength of rave reviews and encouragement from theater folk, Miss Le Gallienne and her mother left wartime London in 1915 for New York. Her bright expectations were not immediately realized. The first two plays in which she found work were failures, and she was dismissed from the cast of another play during its out-of-town tryouts. She spent a season on the road and in summer stock.  First Success         Finally, at the age of 20, she enjoyed her first big success, opposite Sidney Blackmer in Arthur Richman's "Not So Long Ago." This was followed by a still greater hit in 1921 with Joseph Schildkraut in the Theater Guild's production of Molnar's "Liliom."         In 1923, she had another hit in the star role in "The Swan" by Molnar. During its long run in 1923 and again in 1924-25, she became obsessed with the need for a repertory theater.         "Miss Le G.," as generations of theater people called her, came closer than any other person to endowing the United States with a permanent company performing repertory in the manner of the Old Vic, the Comedie Francaise and the Moscow Art Theater.         Without any government subsidy, she very nearly realized her dream. Willingly abandoning a career as a Broadway star in 1926, she founded the Civic Repertory Theater and staged classics at popular prices that filled the old 14th Street Theater for six seasons.         The Civic Rep's production of "Peter Pan," with the actress sailing to the balcony on an invisible wire, enchanted masses of children, and Josephine Hutchinson as "Alice in Wonderland" with Miss Le Gallienne as the White Queen enchanted grownups as well.         Among the company's apprentices were such hopeful novices as Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, J. Edward Bromberg and Howard Da Silva.         But although the Civic Repertory played in the main to full houses, the box office, with a top ticket price of $1.50, never quite met its budget. The company's wealthy patrons were hit by the Depression, donations dwindled and the theater closed in 1933. By then it had given 1,581 performances of 34 plays -- 32 of which Miss Le Gallienne had directed. She also acted in a majority of the plays.         At the end of the 1930-31 season, Miss Le Gallienne was severely burned in the explosion of a gasoline stove at her country home in Weston. The use of her hands was only partly restored in a series of operations, but she so mastered the handicap that few in her audiences perceived it.         After a series of operations on her crippled hands, she directed and starred on Broadway in Rostand's "L'Aiglon" with Ethel Barrymore.  'Rather Play Ibsen Than Eat'         After its long run, Miss Le Gallienne performed the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" in vaudeville, and translated, staged and acted in Ibsen's "Rosmersholm." It failed, using up her financial reserves. Long afterward, she wrote, "I would rather play Ibsen than eat -- and that's often just what it amounts to."         With her longtime companion, the late actress Marion Evensen, she moved to the estate at Weston, which she had bought at a prosperous time in 1926. There, with barnyard and forest creatures, cats and a kennel of cairn terriers, she busily gardened, wove, wrote and studied for the rest of her life -- but never abandoned the theater.         She lectured at colleges, toured frequently in plays and realized a youthful ambition by playing "Hamlet," in a summer production that she staged with the young Uta Hagen as Ophelia. For the Theater Guild, she directed a series of revivals at popular prices.         During the war years, the actress also toured for the Guild as Mrs. Malaprop in "The Rivals" and returned to Broadway as a star opposite Joseph Schildkraut in two successes: "Uncle Harry" by Thomas Job and a new "Cherry Orchard." She had also produced the play and helped to translate it.         With Margaret Webster and Cheryl Crawford, Miss Le Gallienne helped organize the American Repertory Theater in 1946, but the reviews were mixed, the costs were high and the three leaders did not always agree. The first season was the last.         In 1958, her television production of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey" was described by Jack Gould, the New York Times critic, as "unforgettable" and her part as "acting at its supreme best." Played Queen Elizabeth         Another memorable role was her performance as Queen Elizabeth in Schiller's "Mary Stuart," which she did on stage across the country periodically from 1957 through 1962, and also on television.         As translator, director and a star of Chekhov's "Seagull" in 1964, Miss Le Gallienne received from Adlai E. Stevenson the award of the American National Theater and Academy. She got another ANTA award on her 78th birthday in 1977.         She was then on tour, in "The Royal Family." The revival of the Edna Ferber-George S. Kaufman comedy based on the Barrymore family was a hit of the 1976 Broadway season and a triumph for Miss Le Gallienne, who played the mother of the tribe, skipping girlishly upstairs in Act I and descending like an elderly queen in Act III.         As a result of her work in "The Royal Family," she received New York City's cultural award, the Handel Medallion, and the observation by the actress Rosemary Harris:         "If you listen to Miss Le G., you can hear 15 shades of meaning in 15 syllables."         In 1981 Miss Le Gallienne returned to Broadway in "To Grandmother's House We Go," which ran for only 61 performances. Returned as White Queen         But her enthusiasm for her next Broadway project was boundless, since it involved her co-directing a late 1982 revival of her beloved "Alice in Wonderland" and again assuming the role of the White Queen. It, too, however, was a flop, closing after 21 regular performances.         In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Arts.         Miss Le Gallienne traveled everywhere for many years with a two-pound Yorkshire terrier, Nana, in a little basket.         After observing two barnyard hens, she wrote a children's book, "Flossie and Bossie: A Moral Tale." She also translated "Seven Tales by Hans Christian Andersen" and wrote a bio graphy, "The Mystic in the Theater: Eleonora Duse" (1966).         Stagestruck to the end, she once recalled a young woman complaining that she had never seen Sarah Bernhardt, Sacha Guitry, Isadora Duncan or Duse. "I thought to myself," Miss Le Gallienne said, " 'I wouldn't change places with you for anything; not even to be 20 again!' "         There are no survivors.       
         Lorraine Walters Katz, a retired owner of a children's clothing store in Deal, N.J., died on Monday at Riverview Hospital in Red Bank, N.J. She was 66 years old and lived in Deal.         She died of lymphoma, her husband said.         From 1960 to 1980, she owned and operated Young World.         Mrs. Katz was born in Asbury Park, N.J., and was a graduate of the University of Miami. She was a member of the first women's advisory board for First Merchants Bank, now Midlantic National Bank, in Asbury Park in 1970.         She is survived by her husband, Stanley R. Katz, the mayor of Deal; four sons, Richard, of West Long Branch, N.J., Steven, of Livingston, N.J., Robert, of Minneapolis, and Jonathan, of Tucson, Ariz.; a sister, Helen Rosengarten of Monmouth Beach, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Margaret L. Suckley, an aide and confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and an archivist at the nation's first Presidential Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., died on Saturday at Wilderstein, her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 99 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Miss Suckley, who was known as Daisy, was a distant cousin and close neighbor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and lived her entire life in the landmark house overlooking the Hudson River near Hyde Park built by her grandfather in 1852.         In 1940, Miss Suckley, who raised Scottish terriers, gave the President a puppy he named Fala. The dog soon became the country's most photographed animal. Miss Suckley was the co-author of a children's book about Fala and took part in producing two short films depicting the dog's life in the limelight. Center of Political Uproar         Fala became the center of a political uproar in the 1944 Presidential campaign, when Republicans charged that the Navy had sent a warship to rescue the dog after he had been left behind during a visit by President Roosevelt to the Aleutian Islands. The President turned the story to his advantage by expressing mock indignation that his Republican adversaries would attack "even my little dog Fala."         Miss Suckley was largely invisible to the general public although she traveled with the President on wartime inspection trips and to meetings with heads of state and allied military leaders. She was at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga., when President Roosevelt suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945.         She continued on the staff of the Roosevelt Library until she retired in 1963. She often spoke about the Roosevelt Presidency from her privileged station close to the family but was unassuming and meticulously factual and circumspect in her recollections. Nurse's Aide During War         Miss Suckley was born at Wilderstein and was a descendant of several prominent American families of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Livingstons and Beekmans. She attended Bryn Mawr and during World War I served as a nurse's aide at a military hospital on Ellis Island.         In 1980, she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation, dedicated to the maintenance and public enjoyment of her 45-acre riverfront property whose grounds were designed by Calvert Vaux, the noted 19th century park architect, and whose Queen Anne interiors were the work of J. B. Tiffany. Last year Wilderstein received National Historic Landmark status.         Miss Suckley, the last of seven brothers and sisters, is survived by two nieces, Margaret Hendrick of Annapolis, Md., and Catherine Hambley of Rhinebeck.       
         Patricia Robbins Beatty, an award-winning author of 50 children's books, died on Tuesday at the Riverside (Calif.) Community Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in Riverside.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Beatty's books were generally admired for their evocation of both the humor and the harsh realities of the American West in the 19th century. Her more recent novels, including "Charley Skedaddle" (1987), which won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, dealt with the Civil War.         She was born in Portland, Ore., and spent much of her childhood in the Northwest, sometimes living on Indian reservations. She graduated from Reed College in Portland and became a children's librarian and a high school teacher of English and history.         She began to write when her children were small and drew on her knowledge of the Quileute Indians for her first book, "The Indian Canoe Maker," published in 1960 by Caxton Press. Eleven books that followed were written in collaboration with her first husband, Dr. John L. Beatty, a professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, who died in 1975.         In 1974, she received an award for a distinguished body of work from the Southern California Council on Children's Literature. In 1988, she established the John and Patricia Beatty Award through the California Library Association to encourage the writing of children's books about the culture and heritage of California.         A forthcoming book, "Jayhawker," the story of a young abolitionist during the Civil War, is to be published by Morrow Junior Books in October.         She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Carl Uhr, a professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside; a daughter, Alexandra Beatty, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Frankenthaler Feldon, the first woman to become a trustee of Congregation Emanu-El in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her daughter said.         Mrs. Feldon was named a trustee of Congregation Emanu-El in May 1957 and remained in the post until 1967.         She was born in Manhattan, the daughter of George Frankenthaler, a State Supreme Court justice, and Marion Hendricks Frankenthaler. She graduated from Vassar College in 1939.         Her first husband, Richard Lewisohn Jr., died in 1976, and her second husband, Richard Feldon, died in 1988.         She is survived by three children from her first marriage: a daughter, Aileen Godsick of Manhattan, and two sons, Richard Lewisohn 3d of Manhattan and Clifford Lewisohn of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Anne F. Kohn of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Gisela Warburg Wyzanski, a leader in Zionist women's and youth activities for several decades, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 79 years old.         She died of leukemia, her famlly said.         Mrs. Wyzanski was a longtime national board member of Hadassah, the American women's Zionist organization, and worked in Berlin in the Hitler era with Youth Aliah, a group that resettled Jewish children in Palestine and other countries.         She was born in Hamburg and came to the United States as a refugee in 1939. She served for a quarter century as chairman for the Boston area of the greeting-card fund-raising campaign for Unicef.         Her husband, Charles E. Wyzanski, a former chief judge of Federal District Court in Boston, whom she married in 1943, died in 1986. She is survived by a son, Charles M. Wyzanski of Cambridge, a daughter, Anita Robboy of Cambridge; a sister, Anita Warburg of Manhattan, and four granddaughters.

         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.         Dr. Weaver is believed to have been the first black woman to earn a doctorate in her field, speech correction, audiology and linguistics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Northwestern.         Dr. Weaver graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1932. She taught in speech departments at Roosevelt College in Chicago and Howard University in Washington, as well as Brooklyn College.         In 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson named her husband Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making him the first black Cabinet member in the nation's history. At first, Dr. Weaver remained at Brooklyn College and the Weavers had a commuter marriage. But, Mr. Weaver said yesterday, it was not satisfactory and she retired in 1967 to join him in Washington.         While there, she served as a consultant to the Women's Job Corps, the National Advisory Research Council of the Institute of Dental Research and the Children's Hearing and Speech Center, an affiliate of Children's Hospital.         Besides her husband, Dr. Weaver is survived by a brother, Hampton D. Haith of Winston-Salem, N.C.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Erma Campbell, an actress in theater, television and films, died on Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 49 years old.         She died of cancer, said Margo Britton, a friend of the family.         Ms. Campbell appeared in a number of Off Broadway and regional theater productions. In 1990, she won praise for her portrayal of a blues singer in "Ground People," an Off Broadway play about a black minstrel troupe in the 1920's.         She appeared on television in the soap operas "The Guiding Light" and "All My Children," and had a small role in the Woody Allen film "Zelig."         She is survived by her mother, Addie Hutchins of Los Angeles; two sons, Darrin and Raymond, and a daughter, Tracey, all of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.       
         Edythe Lutzker, a historian and author who went to college at age 46, died on Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from lung congestion, her son Michael said.         Mrs. Lutzker wrote a book on the first group of women to get M.D. degrees in England in the 19th century, "Women Gain a Place in Medicine," in 1969. She also wrote a biography of one of them, "Edith Pechey-Phipson, M.D.: The Story of England and India's Foremost Pioneering Woman Doctor."         More recently, Mrs. Lutzker, with Carol Jochnowitz, wrote a biography of Waldemar M. Haffkine, a bacteriologist who discovered vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague.         In 1950, when Mrs. Lutzker was 46, she enrolled in City College. "All my life I've had to postpone going to college," she said. "The problems that arise when a working woman brings up children forced me to put it off." She graduated in 1954 in the college's first arts and science class that included women.         She received her master's degree from Columbia University in 1959.         Mrs. Lutzker is survived by three sons, Michael, of New York City; Arthur, of Oakhurst, N.J., and Paul, of Washington; two brothers, David Levine of Margate, Fla., and Robert Levine of New York City; a sister, Miriam Gindin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses, whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died Thursday night at her home in South Salem, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill. She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten."         Her most recent New York appearances were in 1987, as O'Neill's wife Carlotta Monterey O'Neill in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival, and on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in his "Ah, Wilderness!"  Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of the Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until May of this year.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant about using her distinctive big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings."         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee-Downer Collegewhere she decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms."

         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Aline (Honi) Pollitzer Weiss, active for more than half a century with organizations concerned with the welfare of children, died on Sunday at her summer home in Stephentown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Medford, N.J.         She died in her sleep, her son-in-law, Judge Louis Pollak of Philadelphia, said.         For many years, Mrs. Weiss was chairwoman of the board of the Wiltwyck School for Boys. She was also on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development, Louise Wise Services and the Encampment for Citizenship, a youth leadership development group.         She came from a family with a tradition of social involvement. Her mother, Alice Kohn Pollitzer, one of nine women in Barnard College's first graduating class, founded the Encampment for Citizenship. Her sister, Margaret Pollitzer Hoben, helped found the Walden School.         When she was 70, Mrs. Weiss and her mother, on principle, challenged a Federal Government provision that required Medicare applicants to sign a loyalty oath. In 1967, while their challenge moved through the court system, the Justice Department conceded that the oath was unconstitutional.         Mrs. Weiss's husband, Louis, died in 1950. She is survived by two daughters, Elizbeth W. Goldwasser of Urbana, Ill., and Katherine W. Pollak of Philadelphia; a son, Dr. William P. Weiss of Chester, Vt., 18 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Florence B. Seibert, who invented the first reliable tuberculosis test and helped improve the safety of intravenous injections, died on Aug. 23 at the Palm Springs Nursing Home in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed. Teresa Hicks, an aide who helped care for Dr. Seibert at the home, said she had been in declining health in the last two years and suffered from complications from childhood polio.         For her pioneering research Dr. Seibert was inducted last year into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y.         She was born in Easton, Pa., and was stricken by polio at the age of 3. Forced to wear braces, she turned to academic pursuits because, she later recalled, "I couldn't go out and dance and play" like other children. Academic and Medical Achievements         She graduated at the top of her high school class and won a scholarship to Goucher College in Maryland. After graduating she worked as a chemist in a paper mill in World War I. She then won a scholarshipto Yale University, where she earned a Ph.D.         While studying at Yale she discovered that some bacteria managed to survive existing distillation methods. Contaminated distilled water, when used for intravenous injections, often caused fever in patients. Dr. Seibert devised a simpler and better distillation process that eliminated the germs, making injections safer.         A Guggenheim Fellowship led her to Uppsala University in Sweden and her best-known discovery. She devised a method for isolating tuberculosis protein molecules, then used the material to develop a skin reaction test for tuberculosis infection.         The test was adopted as the standard by the United States in 1941 and by the World Health Organization in 1952, and is still in use today. A Public Health Consultant         During her career Dr. Seibert taught and did research at the University of Chicago and the Sprague Institute in Chicago, and at the Henry Phipps Institute of the University of Pennsylvania. She was also a consultant to the United States Public Health Service.         Dr. Seibert wrote many articles for scientific journals, and held five honorary degrees. Even after she retired in Florida, Dr. Seibert conducted research on cancer.         She is survived by a younger sister, Mabel, of St. Petersburg, who assisted in Dr. Seibert's research and lived with her.       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.       
         Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, great-aunt of King Hussein of Jordan and an artist best known as an abstract painter of the Paris School in the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday after a short illness. She was 89 years old.         During an artistic career that spanned more than 60 years, the princess blended elements of Islamic and Byzantine art with abstract and other influences from the West. She had exhibitions in major galleries in Paris, London and New York City.         The princess was born in 1901 in Istanbul to a prominent Ottoman family that included many artists. She began painting at the age of 14 and was one of the first women to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul.         In 1934 she married King Hussein's great-uncle Prince Zeid el Hussein, a diplomat serving as a minister plenipotentiary in Turkey for his brother King Faisal I of Iraq. He died in 1970.         She is survived by a son, Prince Raad bin Zeid, and two children from a previous marriage: another son, Nejad Devrim of Warsaw, a painter, and a daughter, Sirin Devrim Trainer of New York City, an actress.

After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.       
         Anne Marie Jauss, an author of books for children and an illustrator, died on Friday at a nursing home in Milford, N.J. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes, said a friend, Florence Stephens.         Ms. Jauss was born in Munich, Germany, and studied at the state art school in Berlin. She left Germany in 1942 and moved to Lisbon, making a living as a painter, an illustrator and a pottery-maker. In 1946, she moved to the United States and began a career as a writer of children's books.         Her best-known book is "Under a Green Roof" which was published in 1960 by J.B. Lippincott of Philadelphia and New York in 1960.         She is survived by one nephew.       
         Elaine Horwitch, who established the Elaine Horwitch Galleries for contemporary art in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Santa Fe, N.M., died on Saturday at her home in Santa Fe. She was 58 years old, and also had a home in Scottsdale.         She died of a heart attack, said Abby Braun, director of the Santa Fe gallery.         Mrs. Horwitch and her husband, Arnold, moved from Chicago to Scottsdale in 1955. She established her gallery there in 1973, and opened the one in Santa Fe three years later. At one time she also had galleries in Sedona, Ariz., and Palm Springs, Calif.         Surviving in addition to her husband are their five children, Mark, of San Francisco; Mindi and Wendy, of Los Angeles; Carrie, of Seattle, and Deena Semler of Portland, Ore., and a sister, Joan Siewert of Lake Forest, Ill.       
         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Belinda Mason, a member of the National Commission on AIDS who pleaded with President Bush in a letter in August not to support proposed Federal policies that she said would further stigmatize AIDS sufferers, died this morning at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. She was 33 years old.         She died of AIDS-related pneumonia, a spokesman for the commission said.         Ms. Mason was infected with the virus that causes AIDS when she received a blood transfusion in 1987 while giving birth to her second child. Hospital workers had not tested the blood she received, but later found that it was contaminated with the AIDS virus.         Before she became infected, Ms. Mason worked as a reporter for two weekly newspapers, The Ohio County Times-News in Hartford, Ky., and later for The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky. She also wrote short stories.         When she learned she was infected with AIDS, she became an advocate for better medical and social treatment of people with the AIDS virus. Ms. Mason founded Kentuckiana People With AIDS Coalition, the first Kentucky-based advocacy organization for those stricken with AIDS. 'An AIDS Poster Child'         She later became president of the National Association of People With AIDS and was appointed by President Bush to the National Commission on AIDS in 1990.         "I have become the disease," she said in an interview six weeks ago. "When people talk to me now, they see the disease first. Nobody talks to Belinda Mason the short-story writer anymore. My previous identity has dissolved. I've become an AIDS poster child."         In her letter to Mr. Bush on Aug. 2 she said she had no ill will toward health-care workers even though she contracted the disease through their lapses. She also said she opposed widespread compulsory testing of such workers. Nor, she wrote, did she want people with AIDS to be barred from entering the United States. Both proposals are being considered in Washington.         "Mr. President, doctors don't give people AIDS -- they care for people with it," she wrote. "The blanket screening of health-care workers will create the false illusion that people with AIDS are a threat to others."         Ms. Mason is survived by her husband, Stephen Carden, and their two children, Polly, 8, and Clayton, 4. She will be buried on their Kentucky farm.       
         Emily M. Rosenthal, the director of the 92d Street Y nursery school from 1946 to 1966, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Rosenthal, who lived in the Salvation Army Williams Residence in Manhattan, died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Omus Hirshbein, vice chairman of the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92d Street Y.M.H.A., said yesterday that Miss Rosenthal "was an extraordinary woman in the sense that she brought a cultured aspect of the Old World that is gone today, and passed that on to many generations of kids."         She was widely credited with doing much to shape and develop the school, which was founded in 1938.  Handicraft From Rubble         Miss Rosenthal, a German refugee, came to New York after teaching in England. At a Y nursery school celebration in 1981, Janet Fisher, one of its vice presidents, recalled that in England Miss Rosenthal had turned bomb shelters into nurseries, showing children how to make handicraft items from milk cartons and other materials found in the air-raid rubble.         "She did the same thing here at the Y with found objects," Mrs. Fisher recalled. "She made magic out of nothing."         Miss Rosenthal was born in the city of Krefeld in Germany, attended school in Bonn and graduated from a teacher training college in Frankfurt. She went on to teach at a girls' school in Krefeld and later became the director of a municipal kindergarten there.         In 1939, she fled Germany through the Netherlands to Britain, and in late 1940 she joined her mother and a brother in the United States. She held various teaching posts in New York before becoming director of the nursery school at the Y. After retiring from the school, she taught adult arts and crafts at the Y into the 1970's.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Sylvia Fine Kaye, a producer, lyricist and composer, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Dena Kaye of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaye, the widow of the actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man" (1945), "The Kid from Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman and Danny Kaye. There she began writing specialty material, including a Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Mr. Kaye. In 1940, the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue."         That year, she married Mr. Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for her husband and accompanied him on piano. Wit and Patter         Mrs. Kaye was known for her complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines. Most frequently cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization. "I wrote many songs for Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect love song."         For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely for her husband. She once estimated that she wrote more than 100 songs for him during their 40-year collaboration. She was also involved in the production of almost all his films. She was twice nominated fpr Academy Awards for her work on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953). Musical Comedy on Television         In the 1970's, she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. In 1979, she produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program, "Musical Comedy Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975 she was executive producer for a television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and edited "Assignment Children," a Unicef film that starred her husband.         In the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book about her life with Mr. Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She was also writing a catalogue of show-business material that she and her husband had donated to the Library of Congress.         Brooklyn College awarded her an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.         Mr. Kaye died in 1987 at age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.         Correction:  October 30, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the songwriter Sylvia Fine Kaye omitted a survivor. He is Robert Fine Forrest, of Manhattan, her brother.       
         Dorothy Weed, a piano teacher and former director of the Diller-Quaile Music School on the Upper East Side, died on Tuesday at Doctor's Hospital. She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a long illness, said Marjory Duncalfe, the director of the school.         Miss Weed joined the faculty at Diller-Quaile in 1922, a year after she graduated from Smith College and two years after the school opened. She became a co-director of the school in 1941, and in 1957 she assumed full directorship, a position she held until 1972. Hundreds of children studied piano with her before she retired in 1988. She also specialized in training teachers in music theory, harmony and piano pedagogy.         She is survived by a niece, Nancy Weed Guilman of Lanexa, Va., and two great-nephews.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Edith Zornow, a prominent figure in the New York independent film and video community who produced the animation for "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company" on public television, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.         She died of cancer, said Ellen Morgenstern, a spokeswoman for the Children's Television Workshop, the producer of "Sesame Street."         Ms. Zornow, who was born in Brooklyn, was a producer at the New York public-television station WNDT-TV through the 1960's. There she produced "The Art of Film," a series with the critic Stanley Kauffman as host, for which Ms. Zornow won an Emmy Award in 1964.         She joined the Children's Television Workshop in 1970, during the first season of "Sesame Street," and "helped to define the look of the show, which relies heavily on animation," Ms. Morgenstern said. Among the many prominent independent film makers with whom Ms. Zornow worked were John Hubley and Claudia Weill.  Honoring a Program         In 1979, the Whitney Museum of American Art offered a compilation of "Sesame Street" animation and films commissioned by Ms. Zornow, and the Museum of Modern Art offered a similar program in 1989 to honor the 20th anniversary of "Sesame Street."         In the 1970's, Ms. Zornow was the artistic director of Movies for Kids, a series of programs at Lincoln Center. She also set up and oversaw the film division at Grove Press, and supervised the theatrical release of such ground-breaking films as "Finnegans Wake," "Titticut Follies" and "I Am Curious (Yellow)."         She is survived by a brother, Jack Zornow, of Queens, and two nephews, David Zornow and Todd Zornow, of Manhattan.
