        Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Ms. Kushner gained national recognition in 1975, when she wrote about her battle with breast cancer in a book, ''Why Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her Life,'' published by W. B. Saunders Company in Philadelphia. She became an influential voice questioning standard medical procedures and was a leader in the movement to change the way the disease is treated.         Many of the steps she advocated, especially less radical surgery, were at first rejected by leading breast cancer experts but are now common practice.         As the founder and director of the Breast Cancer Advisory Center in Kensington, Ms. Kushner provided women with crucial information about their options when facing breast cancer.         'Poetic Justice' in Award         She was a member of the National Breast Cancer Advisory Board from 1980 to 1986 and was appointed last year to the American Cancer Society's Breast Cancer Task Force.         This year, Ms. Kushner will be awarded the Society of Surgical Oncology's James Ewing Award for outstanding contributions by a lay person to the fight against cancer. This is ''poetic justice,'' said her husband, Harvey D. Kushner, because the society's members had ''booed her off their stage in 1975,'' after she had challenged their standard treatments.         ''A lot of people heard about her and trusted her,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, director of the division of cancer treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.         At the time of her death, Ms. Kushner was lobbying to encourage the Federal Government to require that health insurance companies cover mammograms.         A psychologist and medical writer, Ms. Kushner turned single-mindedly to her breast cancer crusade in 1974, when she found a lump in her breast but refused to submit to the then routine ''one step'' procedure.         In the mid-1970's, women would be anesthetized, the lump would be removed for biopsy on the spot and, if it was malignant, the breast would be removed. The patient would learn only upon awakening whether she had lost a breast. Ms. Kushner believed that women needed time after a cancer diagnosis to find the best surgeon to remove the breast.         She railed against the one-step procedure and, after 18 telephone calls, finally found a general surgeon to remove just her lump. She later found a breast cancer specialist to remove her breast when the lump proved cancerous.         Role in Changing Practice         Now, the one-step procedure that Ms. Kushner abhorred is no longer done.         ''She is probably the single most important person in leading to this major change in breast surgery,'' Dr. Chabner said. Although there was medical evidence that the one-step procedure was not advisable, Dr. Chabner added, ''I don't think the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had not been so persistent in her efforts.''         Later, Ms. Kushner became an advocate for increased use of lumpectomy, in which the malignant lump is removed but the rest of the breast is left.         Ms. Kushner was born in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1972.         She is survived by her husband, Harvey; her sons, Gantt of Silver Spring, Md., and Todd of Rockville, Md.; a daughter, Lesley Kushner of San Francisco, and her brothers, Isaac and Meyer Rehert of Baltimore and Paul Rehert of West Palm Beach, Fla.

Izard, a retired children's librarian in Westchester County, died of complications from cancer on Monday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa. She was 74 years old.         Miss Izard was a consultant for the Westchester Library System, which has more than 40 branches, for nearly 20 years. She led classes, workshops and monthly meetings for librarians in book reviewing, storytelling and book collections.         She headed the children's services division of the American Library Association and was former chairwoman of its Newbery-Caldecott committee.         She began her career at the New York Public Library and also worked in Greenwich, Conn., and Mount Vernon, N.Y., before going to Westchester in 1959. Miss Izard retired in 1976. The Board of Regents gave her the James E. Allen Jr. Memorial Award for distinguished service to education.         She graduated from Duke University in 1937 and received an M.A. from Simmons College in 1940.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jones instructed young women in charm, beauty and fitness as the owner-operator of the Candy Jones Career Girls School for more than 20 years. Later she and her husband, Long John Nebel, were co-hosts in Manhattan on a late-night talk and interview show, first on Radio Station WOR and then on WMCA. When Mr. Nebel died in 1978, she continued the all-night show until last year.         Candy Jones was born Jessica Arline Wilcox in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and educated in Atlantic City, where she won a beauty pageant at the age of 16. A trip to Manhattan followed, as did a modeling career and small roles in such 1940's Broadway musicals as ''Mexican Hayride'' and ''Polonaise.'' In World War II she headed a U.S.O. troupe called Cover Girls Abroad that entertained troops in the South Pacific.         Author of a Dozen Books         Tall, blond and with blue eyes, she gave beauty advice to women in more than a dozen books, including ''Make Your Name in Modeling and Television,'' ''Finishing Touches,'' ''Look Your Best,'' ''Between Us Girls'' and ''Candy Jones' Complete Book of Beauty and Fashion.'' Graduates of her school included Julia Meade and Sandra Dee.         In radio and television, Miss Jones was the hostess of several daytime talk and interview programs and took part in commercials as a performer, teacher and consultant. She also judged and advised beauty pageants and fashion shows around the country and lectured at colleges.         Before her marriage to Mr. Nebel, Miss Jones was married to Harry S. Conover, a model agency chief. The marriage ended in divorce.         Surviving are two sons, Harry Conover of Sudbury, Mass., and Carey Conover of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President

Peggy van Praagh, an English dancer, ballet mistress and teacher, died in Melbourne, Australia, on Jan. 15. She was 79 years old and had been in poor health for several years.         Miss van Praagh, who was born in London, trained in ballet, mime and modern dance with Margaret Craske, Lydia Sokolova, Vera Volkova and Agnes de Mille, among others. As a soloist with the Ballet Rambert from 1933 to 1938 and a principal dancer with Antony Tudor's London Ballet in 1938, she created important roles in some of Mr. Tudor's signature works, including Episode in His Past in ''Lilac Garden'' and the Russian Ballerina in ''Gala Performance.''         Miss van Praagh inaugurated the popular wartime Lunch-Hour Ballet in London in 1940. She joined the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet the following year, and was appointed ballet mistress of the junior company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, in 1946, serving as its assistant director from 1951 to 1955. She also was ballet producer for British Broadcasting Corporation Television from 1949 to 1955.         Invited to take over the artistic direction of the Borovansky Ballet in Australia, she made a curtain speech urging national support for Australian ballet and was asked to head the newly reorganized Australian Ballet, which she directed from 1962 to 1974.         Miss van Praagh was the author of ''How I Became a Dancer'' and, with Peter Brinson, of the influential book ''The Art of Choreography'' (1963). She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1966 and a Dame of the British Empire in 1970.       
        Josephine Young Case, a poet and writer and the first woman to be a director of the Radio Corporation of America, died on Monday at the Harding Nursing Home in Waterville, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Van Hornesville, N.Y.         Josephine Young Case, a poet and writer and the first woman to be a director of the Radio Corporation of America, died on Monday at the Harding Nursing Home in Waterville, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Van Hornesville, N.Y.         Mrs. Case was the sole daughter of Owen D. and Josephine Edmonds Young. Mr. Young was chairman of the General Electric Company and founded the Radio Corporation of America.         She was educated at the Brearley School and at Bryn Mawr College. In 1931, after her marriage to Everett Needham Case, she received an M.A. in American literature at Radcliffe College. After her family moved to her father's native town of Van Hornesville, she wrote and published her first book, ''At Midnight on the 31st of March'' (1938), in blank verse. The Syracuse University Press will reprint it in the spring.         For 20 years while her husband was president of Colgate University, Mrs. Case taught a literature course at Colgate and published ''Written in Sand'' (1945), a historical novel, and ''Freedom's Farm'' (1946), a poetry collection. Her writing included a biography of her father, ''Owen D. Young and American Enterprise'' (1982), in which her husband collaborated.         She became the first female director of RCA in 1961, and remained in the post until 1972. She was also a board member of Bryn Mawr, the Fund for the Advancement of Education and the National Merit Scholarship Corporation. She was also a member of the national board of the Girl Scouts from 1948 to 1953 and was on the board of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the mid-60's.         A trustee of Skidmore College for many years, Mrs. Case became chairwoman of the board in 1960.         In addition to her husband, survivors include a brother, Richard Young, and a daughter, Josephine Edmonds Case, both of Van Hornesville; three sons, James 3d and John, both of Cambridge, Mass., and Samuel, of Fairfax, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandson.

Mary O'Neill, a children's book author, died of heart failure on Jan. 2 in Yuma (Ariz.) Regional Medical Center. She was 84 years old.         One of her most popular books, ''Hailstones and Halibut Bones: Adventures in Color,'' illustrated by Leonard Weisgard, was published by Doubleday in 1961 and printed in several languages. In it, Mrs. O'Neill identified and interpreted the most familiar colors through verse. The book was used as a supplementary text in schools in the United States and abroad.         Other books for which she wrote the text include ''The White Palace,'' about a Columbia River salmon; ''People I'd Like to Keep,'' a collection of brief sketches of saints, scholars, soldiers and kings; ''Words Words Words,'' and ''Take a Number.''         Born in New York City, Mrs. O'Neill attended Western Reserve University and the University of Michigan. She was an advertising copywriter in Cleveland before becoming a freelance writer.         After the death of her husband, John, she joined the Peace Corps in 1970 and taught journalism and writing for several years in Ghana and Costa Rica.         She is survived by two daughters, Erin Gibbons Baroni, of Wyckoff, N.J., and Manhattan, and Dr. Abigail Hagler, of Yuma.; a stepson, John R. O'Neill, of Montgomery, Ala., and four grandchildren.       
        Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Miss Simon's 10 travel works included the landmark - and best-selling - ''New York Places and Pleasures: An Uncommon Guidebook,'' which has undergone four revisions since 1959, and parallel studies of Mexico City, Paris, London and Rome. Among other guidebooks are ''Italy: The Places in Between'' (1970 and 1984), ''England's Green and Pleasant Land'' (1974), ''Fifth Avenue: A Very Social History'' (1978) and ''A Renaissance Tapestry: The Gonzaga of Mantua'' (1988).         Telling Her Own Story         Autobiographies by the soft-spoken, cosmopolitan writer are ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood'' (1982) and ''A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence'' (1986). Her brother, Michael Grobsmith, said yesterday that Miss Simon recently completed and sent to Harper & Row the manuscript of a third volume, tentatively titled ''Etchings on an Hour Glass,'' ranging from her college years through two marriages and career to her latest travels.         Sybil S. Steinberg described Miss Simon's travel books in ''Publishers Weekly'' as being ''in a class by themselves, distinctly personal guides of rare good taste and discernment.'' J. H. Plumb, in The New York Times Book Review, called her work ''incomparable'' in making ''one of the dullest forms of literature a brilliant work of art.''         Kate Simon, whose given name was Kaila Grobsmith, was born in a Warsaw ghetto on Dec. 5, 1912, came to this country with her family by steerage at the age of 4 and grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx. In ''Bronx Primitive,'' she recalled vividly and unsentimentally her early years, her father, a tyrannical shoemaker, and her mother, who believed deeply in learning and in earning her own living before she married.         Exploring Her Adolescence         In ''A Wider World,'' Miss Simon recounted her rebellious adolescence, which helped get her into the challenging James Monroe High School, where she excelled; becoming a live-in baby sitter for an eccentric, radical family, and tentative, humorous and grim aspects of youthful sexuality. Robert Pinskey, in The New York Times Book Review, lauded her ''clean and unpretentious prose style, her aristocratic disdain for cant and her frank worldiness.''         She earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter College, held various editorial posts, mostly rewriting, and reviewed books for The New Republic and The Nation until she began writing travel guides. She won awards from the National Book Critics Circle, the English Speaking Union and Hunter College, where, her brother said, she was to begin teaching a writing course today.         Asked in 1986 by ''Contemporary Authors'' to advise travelers on how best to enjoy a trip, she replied: ''Go slow. If you have the time for eight countries, take five. If you're rushed to take five, take three.'' She also suggested regular eavesdropping on conversations in cafes, buses and trains and emphasized, ''Walk slowly, look, listen, smell.''         She had been married to Dr. Stanley Goldman, who died in 1942. They had a daughter, Alexandra, who died in 1954. Miss Simon was also married to Robert Simon, a publisher, until their divorce in 1960.         Survivors, besides her brother, who is a public health officer for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, include nieces and a nephew.         A memorial service is to be scheduled soon in Manhattan.       
        Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving sibling of former President Jimmy Carter, died of pancreatic cancer Monday at Sumter Regional Hospital here. She was 63 years old.  It was in December that Mrs. Spann was found to be suffering from the disease, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister, Ruth Stapleton, and her other brother,         Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving sibling of former President Jimmy Carter, died of pancreatic cancer Monday at Sumter Regional Hospital here. She was 63 years old.  It was in December that Mrs. Spann was found to be suffering from the disease, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister, Ruth Stapleton, and her other brother, Billy.         Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in 1983.         Mrs. Spann was an avid motorcyclist and belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights Organization. In 1977 she collected letters sent by her mother from India, where Lillian Carter served in the Peace Corps, for a book, ''Away From Home: Letters to My Family.'' It was published by Simon & Schuster.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by her husband, Walter, and a son, William.       
        Jane McIntire Grigson, a British food writer, died of cancer on Monday at her home in Wiltshire, England. She was 61 years old.         Jane McIntire Grigson, a British food writer, died of cancer on Monday at her home in Wiltshire, England. She was 61 years old.         Ms. Grigson wrote a food column for The Observer, a British Sunday newspaper. She also wrote a number of books, the most recent of which was ''Jane Grigson's Book of British Cookery'' (Atheneum, 1985). Others included ''Food with the Famous'' (Atheneum, 1980); ''Jane Grigson's Vegetable Book'' (Atheneum, 1979); ''The Mushroom Feast'' (Knopf, 1975), and ''The Art of Charcuterie'' (Knopf, 1967).

        Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Miss Lehmann's first novel, ''Dusty Answer,'' won immediate fame for the young author when it was published in 1927. The novel, about a girl's development from childhood to maturity, was praised for its candor, wit and psychological insight as well as for its lyrical, sensuous writing.         She followed this with ''A Note of Music'' in 1930, ''Invitation to the Waltz'' in 1932, ''The Weather in the Streets'' in 1936, ''The Ballad and the Source'' in 1944 and ''The Gypsy's Baby,'' a collection of short stories, in 1946.         Two Sisters, One Lover         Her next book was ''The Echoing Grove,'' about the relationship between two sisters and the man who is the husband of one and the lover of the other.         With shifts of time and approach, the same incidents in the book are seen through the eyes of different people.         The book was written after the bitter breakup of Miss Lehmann's love affair with the poet Cecil Day Lewis, and critics said it carried clear traces of that time in her life.         The soft-voiced author grew up in a large, comfortable home at Bourne End on the Thames near London. She was educated at Cambridge University.         Married 2 Future Lords         She met her first husband, Walter Runciman, who was later to become Lord Runciman, at Cambridge University. They married in 1923 and were divorced in 1928.         Later in 1928, she married Wogan Philipps, the eldest son of the first Lord Milford, the shipping magnate. They had two children, Hugo and Sally. That marriage ended in divorce in 1944.         Her grief over the death of her daughter from polio led her to spiritualism for a time. For many of her later years she was vice president of the privately financed College of Psychic Studies in London.         Toward the end of Miss Lehmann's life, the Virago Press, which specializes in works by women, republished many of her novels, introducing her work to a new generation of readers.         Queen Elizabeth II awarded Miss Lehmann the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982.         She is survived by her son, Hugo.

She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Humor, natural history, the supernatural and witchcraft were the subjects of many of Ms. Hoke's books. She also specialized in anthologies of ghost stories, one of which she wrote with her grandson, Franklin Hoke.         Among her other books for young readers were ''The Horse That Took the Milk Around,'' ''Too Many Kittens,'' ''Factory Kitty'' and ''Grocery Kitty.''         In the late 1930's, Ms. Hoke inaugurated and managed children's book departments at several publishing houses, including Henry Holt, Reynal & Hitchcock and Julian Messer. In the 1940's, Ms. Hoke, whose first marriage, to John Hoke, had ended in divorce, married Franklin Watts, founder the New York publishing company that bears his name. She became the company's vice president and director of international projects.         She and her husband established Franklin Watts Ltd. in London in the 1960's, and Ms. Hoke worked there into the 1970's before returning to the United States. Ms. Hoke also organized Helen Hoke Associates, which represented authors, and oversaw publication of books from inception to marketing. Her son, John Hoke, said she was ''awfully good at finding new authors.''         In the 1970's she began naming her books with what she called ''Terrific Triple Titles.'' Among these books were, ''Witches, Witches, Witches,'' ''Jokes, Jokes, Jokes'' and ''Nurses, Nurses, Nurses,'' an anthology of short stories, poems and excerpts from biographies and novels.         Jean Vestal of Franklin Watts said one of Ms. Hoke's contributions to children's book publishing was her early support of the Bologna International Children's Book Fair in Italy, which has become an important element in the industry.         Ms. Hoke and her son, a photographer and writer, wrote ''Music Boxes: Their Lore and Lure'' in 1957. It was her 32d book and her first nonfiction work.         Ms. Hoke was also executive director of the Julia Ellsworth Ford Foundation, which conducted annual children's book competitions.         Surviving are her son, who lives in Bethesda, and four grandchildren.       
        Dorothy James Roberts, a writer best known for her retelling of ancient Arthurian, Irish and Icelandic myths in historical romances, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Palo Alto.         Dorothy James Roberts, a writer best known for her retelling of ancient Arthurian, Irish and Icelandic myths in historical romances, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Palo Alto.         Miss Roberts, the daughter of a West Virginia oil producer, was the author of 14 books, the most popular of which was ''The Enchanted Cup,'' based on Malory's version of the legend of Tristan and Isolde. It was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1953.         Among her books acclaimed by critics was ''Fire in the Ice,'' based on the Icelandic Njal's Saga and described by Orville Prescott in The New York Times in 1961 as ''somber and splendid.'' The reviewer wrote that Miss Roberts ''imposed order on the disorderly mass of saga material'' by telling the legend from the point of view of one key character, Hallgerda Hoskuldsdottir, and eliminating ''many irrelevant scenes, superflouous characters and tiresome genealogical pedigrees.''         Among her other works were ''Launcelot, My Brother,'' ''A Durable Fire,'' ''Kinsmen of the Grail,'' ''With Night We Banish Sorrow,'' ''A Man of Malice Landing,'' ''Return of the Stranger,'' and ''Mountain Journey,'' all published before her retirement in 1964.         Miss Roberts is survived by a twin sister, Anna Craine of Denver, and a nephew, Jim Craine of Sacramento, Calif.       
        Elisa Bialk Krautter, who wrote under the the name Elisa Bialk, died of cancer last Wednesday at Hilton Head Hospital on Hilton Head Island, S.C. She was 81 years old and lived on the island.         Elisa Bialk Krautter, who wrote under the the name Elisa Bialk, died of cancer last Wednesday at Hilton Head Hospital on Hilton Head Island, S.C. She was 81 years old and lived on the island.         Mrs. Krautter, who grew up in Chicago, was still in high school when her first writing was published, in newspapers and then in magazines. She wrote poetry, then turned to short stories, which appeared in magazines like Story, McCall's, The Saturday Evening Post and Good Housekeeping.         She turned one of her stories, ''The Sainted Sisters,'' into a play, which was made into a film starring Veronica Lake and Joan Caulfield in 1948.         She developed another of her stories, ''The Horse Called Pete,'' into a children's book in 1948, the first of 28 books for young people.         Her first novel, ''On What Strange Stuff,'' was published by Doubleday in 1935. She also wrote nonfiction articles and newspaper and magazine columns, and she taught writers' workshops. She was married to L. Martin Krautter, an advertising executive, who died in 1984.         Surviving are two daughters, Elena Lonsdorf of Atlanta and Elizabeth Treadwell of New York, and four grandchildren.       
        Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan.         Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers. In the faintly discernible accent of her native Hungary, she was fond of joking, though without affectation, ''Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.''         Everyone from the president of the library to her assistants called Dr. Szladits by her first name. She, in turn, was on a first-name basis with her precious manuscripts. When she spoke of ''Tom,'' she meant T. S. Eliot, of ''Wystan,'' W. H. Auden, and of ''Virginia,'' her greatly admired diarist and novelist, Virginia Woolf.         Sitting in her cramped office off the Berg's reading and exhibition rooms on the third floor of the library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, Dr. Szladits liked to reach for the exact quotation from one of the tens of thousands of documents in the collection.         'We Protect the Written Word'         Last year, when she mounted a show on diarists, it included 50 of her famous authors, including James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville and, of course, Virginia Woolf, whose manuscripts in 33 volumes are one of the prizes in the Berg. She liked to quote ''Virginia,'' who said, ''Fortunately, intellect has no gender.''         Dr. Szladits considered the Berg not a musty repository of the past but a working collection that was used by biographers from all over the world.         ''We protect the written word at the Berg,'' she told Whitney Balliett, who wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker on Dec. 31, 1984 - the first such article about a librarian in the magazine's history. ''It is a research collection, not a museum. It has to be used. It is alive. My role at the Berg is to stand still and allow the collection to grow. In fact, I try to make time itself stand still here. I try to create quiet and the timelessness that allows for the pursuit of truth.''         Auden's Handwritten Notebooks         Born in Budapest, she immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. After receiving her doctorate in Hungary, she did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris, University College in London and Columbia University. She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.         Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's handwritten notebooks. She also established or expanded files on Conrad Aiken, H. G. Wells, Muriel Rukeyser, Evelyn Waugh, Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, May Sarton, Washington Irving, Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.         ''I am buying in eternity,'' Dr. Szladits once remarked.         Paul Fasana, the library's Andrew W. Mellon Director of Research Libraries, said yesterday: ''Lola was an original. Her standards, for herself and others, were high and at times unattainable. Her dedication to the ideal of literary scholarship was fierce. But she was also loving and human.''         Dr. Szladits was married to Charles Szladits, a professor of law at Columbia University, who died in 1986.         A memorial service will be held on May 5 in the Celeste Bartos Forum of the library, and a book fund in her name will be established for the Berg Collection.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''

        Bella Spewack, co-author with her late husband, Samuel, of a string of wacky comedies for Broadway and film - including such hits as ''Boy Meets Girl'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Kiss Me, Kate'' - died Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         Bella Spewack, co-author with her late husband, Samuel, of a string of wacky comedies for Broadway and film - including such hits as ''Boy Meets Girl'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Kiss Me, Kate'' - died Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         ''She was an original,'' said Lois Elias, a friend of Mrs. Spewack for 30 years. Mrs. Spewack had no survivors. Her husband died in 1971.  ''She never thought like other people,'' Mrs. Elias said. ''She was witty, sharp, but with a quixotic approach to life, a great concern for others.'' At the same time, Mrs. Elias added, ''She was a very good businesswoman; the one who made all the arrangements for the productions.''         Mrs. Spewack, whose maiden name was Bella Cohen, was born in the Transylvania region of what is now Romania, and brought to the United States as an infant.         Radical, Pacifist Views         Growing up on the East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Spewack graduated from Washington Irving High School in 1917. She soon went job hunting, but was turned down time after time as she sought any job available, preferably at a newspaper.         Eventually, the Yorkville Home News hired her as a writer and, soon after, her radical, pacifist views brought her to The New York Call, a socialist newspaper.         Her work apparently caught the attention of Samuel Spewack, then a young reporter for The World. ''Sam really fell in love with my writing,'' Mrs. Spewack said at the time of her husband's death. The Spewacks were married in 1922 and, after spending several years together as correspondents in Moscow, they launched a writing collaboration that eventually spanned four decades.         Their comedy was almost always madcap, verging on slapstick and knock-about farce. It was often peopled by the harassed, the rattle-brained, the blunder-prone and the pompous, among other cartoon-like characters.         Names Up in Lights         Almost every other year, from the 1930's through the 1950's, the names of Spewack works went up in lights on Broadway: ''Clear All Wires,'' in 1932; ''Spring Song,'' in 1934; ''Boy Meets Girl,'' in 1935; ''Leave It to Me,'' in 1938; ''Two Blind Mice'' and ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' both in 1949, and ''My Three Angels,'' in 1953.         Among the movies written by the Spewacks were ''The Nuisance,'' ''Three Loves Has Nancy,'' ''The Gay Bride,'' ''The Cat and the Fiddle,'' ''Weekend at the Waldorf'' and ''My Favorite Wife.''         ''Clear All Wires,'' based on their experiences as reporters in Moscow, was the Spewacks' first big break on Broadway, premiering in 1932. Six years later, it was turned into a musical under the title, ''Leave It to Me,'' with a score by Cole Porter. The show, which included the song, ''My Heart Belongs to Daddy,'' introduced a new young star to Broadway - Mary Martin.         In ''Boy Meets Girl,'' which opened in New York on Nov. 27, 1935, and ran for 669 performances, the Spewacks wrote about a fictional writing team, Benson and Law. The script included an exchange that has slipped into common usage.         'Boy Meets Girl'         ''Listen,'' Benson says. ''I've been writing stories for 11 years. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl.''         ''Kiss Me Kate,'' a takeoff of Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' with a score by Mr. Porter, ran for 1,077 performances in New York and won a Tony Award, as well as a Page One Award, for the Spewacks in 1949. The critic, Brooks Atkinson, wrote that ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' had ''the best musical comedy book of the year.''         The Spewacks had their share of flops. But, in 1955, on the night after a play called ''Festival'' received a chilly reception from the critics, Mrs. Spewack - a tiny, round woman -fought back. She marched onto the stage during curtain calls and appealed to the audience to go tell their friends if they liked the show.         ''Having a failure isn't such a dreadful thing,'' she told an interviewer. ''But 'Festival' is a good, clean show, and when I heard the audience laughing and applauding, I felt it must be something they wanted.''         Mrs. Spewack then went on a dozen radio and television programs, defending ''Festival.'' And the show was extended, if only for several more weeks.       
        Jill Ireland, the British-born movie actress who chronicled her long battle against breast cancer in a best-selling book, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Malibu, Calif. She was 54 years old.         Jill Ireland, the British-born movie actress who chronicled her long battle against breast cancer in a best-selling book, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Malibu, Calif. She was 54 years old.         Ms. Ireland, the wife of the actor Charles Bronson, told the story of her diagnosis, mastectomy, chemotherapy and self-discovery in her 1987 book, ''Life Wish.'' In The New York Times Book Review, Alison Friesinger praised the book for its ''wonderfully human details'' and said that it was ''constantly enlivened by Ms. Ireland's grace and fortitude.''         Ms. Ireland became a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society, urging women with breast cancer to have self-respect and optimism. She also testified in 1988 about medical costs before a Congressional committee, and received the Medal of Courage from President Ronald Reagan.         An Early Career Start         Ms. Ireland began her film career at the age of 16, appearing in ''Oh Rosalinda,'' the first of 16 movies she made for the Rank Organization, a British production company. She also appeared in such films as ''Robbery Under Arms'' with her first husband, the actor David McCallum.         After moving to Hollywood in 1962, Ms. Ireland appeared in many television series, including ''Ben Casey,'' ''Daniel Boone,'' ''Mannix,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' and ''Shane.'' She and Mr. McCallum were divorced in 1967 and a year later she married Charles Bronson. They starred together in many action-adventure movies, including ''Love and Bullets,'' ''Noon Till Three'' and ''Death Wish II.''         Coping With Adversity         Ms. Ireland also wrote of coping with adversity in her 1989 book, ''Life Lines.'' In it, she discussed her father's debilitating aphasia and the drug abuse of her adopted son, Jason, who subsequently died of a lethal drug combination. At the time of her death she was writing a third book, called ''Life Times.''         Ms. Ireland is survived by her husband; her parents, Jack and Dorothy Ireland, of Sussex, England; her brother, John Ireland, of Toronto, Ontario, and six children: Paul and Valentine McCallum; Suzanne, Tony and Zulieka Bronson, and Katrina Holden, all of Los Angeles.       
        Lucy Boston, a leading writer of children's fiction, died on Friday at her home, the Manor, a 12th-century Norman house at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, England, which provided the inspiration and setting for her influential ''Green Knowe'' books. She was 97 years old.         Lucy Boston, a leading writer of children's fiction, died on Friday at her home, the Manor, a 12th-century Norman house at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, England, which provided the inspiration and setting for her influential ''Green Knowe'' books. She was 97 years old.         The nearly 20 works by Mrs. Boston, who began writing in her 60's, were noted for delicacy and imagination and for extolling nature's virtues. Most were books for juveniles. Her first book, ''The Children of Green Knowe,'' was praised in The New Yorker in 1955 as ''an uncommon tale with a gratifying blend of the eerie, the sinister and the familiar.''         Mrs. Boston, an energetic woman who wrote during the cold months and gardened in the summers on her four-acre estate, suffered two strokes in March, according to her son, Peter, an architect in nearby Cambridge, who illustrated most of her books.         Translated and Televised         The works were widely used in schools, translated into many languages and televised by the BBC. ''The Children of Green Knowe'' received a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1969, and ''A Stranger at Green Knowe'' earned the Carnegie Medal in Britain in 1962.         The ''stranger'' of the title was an escaped gorilla befriended and hidden by an orphaned Chinese boy. ''The book encapsulates the best qualities of her work,'' said The Times of London, which went on to list ''a crystal-clear style of storytelling, a respect for the innocence and intelligence of the young reader, a serious treatment of supernatural phenomena, a regard for all natural life and a belief that a man-centered conception of the world is false and crippling.''         In 1970, Mrs. Boston described her professional objectives thus: ''To remind adults of joy, now considered obsolete - and to encourage children to use and trust their senses for themselves at first hand - their ears, eyes and noses, their fingers and the soles of their feet, their skins and their breathing, their muscular joy and rhythms and heartbeats, their instinctive loves and pity and their awe of the unknown.''         An Early Foe of Pollution         The former Lucy Maria Wood was born on Dec. 10, 1892, in Southport, Lancashire, into a devout Methodist family. Her father was an engineer. She attended Somerville College at Oxford for a year and left to serve as a nurse in France in World War I. She married Harold Boston, then an officer in the Royal Flying Corps. They settled in Cheshire, where she became an early campaigner against industrial pollution.         The couple were divorced in 1935, and Mrs. Boston studied painting on the Continent until she returned home in early 1939, on the eve of World War II. It was then that she bought the crumbling 12th-century manor, which she soon transformed into one of the oldest habitable homes in England.         Surviving, besides her son, are two granddaughters and two stepgrandsons.       
        Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         ''She first came to see me at the beach about 15 years ago when my kids were little,'' Ralph Lauren recalled. ''She was a very sparkly girl, and her pictures were great. The ones she did of my family are hanging in my office today.''         When she was starting as a photographer, after studying at Pratt Institute, Mrs. Walz heard Jill Krementz in a lecture at New York University tell how she had decided to concentrate on photographing authors.         ''She then decided to specialize in fashion,'' Miss Krementz said. ''I guess I was her mentor. She turned out to be not only a superb technician, but a woman of wit and wisdom, a photographer with a warm generous heart.''         The Entertaining Insight         In the introduction to her first book, ''The Fashion Makers,'' published in 1978, when designers were achieving the star status of athletes and entertainers, Mrs. Walz described her approach. ''I always tried to bring out some part of their personality for the public to see,'' she wrote. ''I found a magic in the designers I photographed. I also became aware that the public was reaching to them on a new level and they had become celebrities.''         She photographed her subjects in bathtubs, gymnasiums, dental offices and beauty parlors to capture the entertaining insight into their personalities. For a study of Elsa Peretti, Mrs. Waltz went to Spain and photographed the designer in her pool. Despite having lost a leg to cancer when she was 15, Mrs. Walz climbed a 12-foot ladder to find the right angle.         Not all of her subjects were in the fashion field. ''Starring Mothers,'' about well-known mothers and their children, was published in 1987, after her own two daughters had been born. Mrs. Walz's subjects included Diane Feinstein, Patti Labelle, Sally Quinn and Carly Simon. It was considered one of the best photographic books of the year and was included in a group show by the International Center of Photography.         Her subjects for 15 cover stories for The New York Times Magazine included E. L. Doctorow, Joseph Papp and Stephen Sondheim. Her photographs also appeared in GQ, Metropolitan Home, Parade, Rolling Stone and Town & Country.         Surviving are her husband, a furniture and interior designer, their children, Jersey, and Addison, and her parents, Stanley and Pauline Turner, of Toms River, N.J.       
        Maud Van Cortlandt Oakes, an ethnologist, writer and artist who chronicled the culture of primitive Indian tribes in Guatemala, died Sunday at her home in Carmel, Calif. She was 87 years old. The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, said her conservator, Kay Woolsey.         Maud Van Cortlandt Oakes, an ethnologist, writer and artist who chronicled the culture of primitive Indian tribes in Guatemala, died Sunday at her home in Carmel, Calif. She was 87 years old. The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, said her conservator, Kay Woolsey.         Miss Oakes spent 17 months from late 1945 to early 1947 as the only outsider living in Todos Santos, a remote village in the Guatemalan highlands, where she studied the pre-Columbian roots of the Indians living there.         In 1951 she published two books about her findings, ''Beyond the Windy Place,'' about life among the Indians, and '' The Two Crosses of Todos Santos,'' detailing the survival of Mayan religious ritual.         Miss Oakes was born in Seattle and grew up in Manhattan. She developed an interest in the Indians' past while vacationing on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound.         Her most recent book, ''The Stone Speaks: The Memoir of a Personal Transformation,'' was published in 1987.         Miss Oakes is survived by a niece, Mary Barnard of Olympia, Wash., and a nephew, Alfred Woolsey of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Brenda Lansdown, a retired professor of education who introduced new teaching methods in China, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 86 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass. The cause of death was pneumonia, said Harriet Harvey, a friend.         Brenda Lansdown, a retired professor of education who introduced new teaching methods in China, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 86 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass. The cause of death was pneumonia, said Harriet Harvey, a friend.         In the 1940's Ms. Lansdown taught at the Dalton School and the City and Country School in Manhattan, where she developed a ''hands-on'' method of teaching science to elementary and high school students, known as the investigative colloquium method. She later became a professor of education at Brooklyn College and also taught at Hunter College and the Harvard Graduate School of Education.         In 1974, at the age of 70, she began the study of Mandarin, and in 1979 was invited to Peking Normal University to introduce her teaching method to China. The method differs sharply from traditionial Chinese pedagogy, in which rote memorization is emphasized over creative thinking and problem solving.         Translated Into Chinese         Her book, ''Teaching Elementary Science Through Investigation and Colloquium,'' first published in 1971, was translated into Chinese, and more than 30,000 copies have been distributed to educators in China. Videotapes of her demonstration classes have been beamed by satellite to schools in the provinces.         In the last six years Ms. Lansdown raised funds in the United States for an experimental work-study cooperative school in a remote area of China that uses hands-on principles to teach Chinese farmers animal husbandry, agriculture and forestry.         Ms. Lansdown, a native of London, attended St. Paul's School there and graduated from Lausanne University in Switzerland.         She is survived by a brother, Merton, of Dorset, England.       
        Esther Lucile Brown, an author, educator and social anthropologist whose contributions led to major changes in nursing education and practice, died July 6 at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 92 years old and lived in San Francisco.         Esther Lucile Brown, an author, educator and social anthropologist whose contributions led to major changes in nursing education and practice, died July 6 at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 92 years old and lived in San Francisco.         She died of complications from an aneurysm, a friend said.         Dr. Brown, who earned a Ph.D. in social anthropology from Yale in 1929, joined the Russell Sage Foundation in Manhattan in 1930 as a research associate and at her retirement in 1963 was its director of executive program planning.         In 1948, her book ''Nursing for the Future'' recommended that professional schools of nursing be established at universities and that clinical nursing specialties be developed. She also wrote books on patient care and was internationally known as a lecturer and consultant. She was an honorary life member of the National League for Nursing. Her books also included: ''Social Work as a Profession,'' ''Lawyers, Law Schools and the Public Service,'' and ''From Custodial to Therapeutic Patient Care in Mental Hospitals.'' She had also taught at the universities of New Hampshire and Wisconsin at Madison.         She is survived by a cousin.       
        Olive Ann Burns, whose illness with lymphoma prompted her to write the 1984 novel ''Cold Sassy Tree,'' died on Wednesday. She was 65 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Olive Ann Burns, whose illness with lymphoma prompted her to write the 1984 novel ''Cold Sassy Tree,'' died on Wednesday. She was 65 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Ms. Burns died of heart failure, said a spokesman for Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta.         Set in a small town in Georgia in 1906, her novel centers on a scandal that erupts when a crusty old man marries a young Yankee milliner just weeks after his first wife's death. As seen through the eyes of a teen-age boy, the May-December relationship develops from a marriage of convenience to one of deep love and trust.         A TV Movie         ''Cold Sassy Tree'' became a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate selection in 1984 and was made into a movie broadcast on the TNT cable network in October. It featured Faye Dunaway and Richard Widmark as the couple and Neil Patrick Harris as the boy.         Ms. Burns decided to write the novel moments after a doctor diagnosed her disease in 1975, her brother, William H. Burns of Atlanta, said yesterday. ''She told me she thought: 'I've got to do something,' '' he said. '' 'I can't just sit home.' ''         ''She had always wanted to write a book,'' Mr. Burns said, adding that their father had been a storyteller and that Ms. Burns had been taking copious notes of his tales, some of which inspired ''Cold Sassy Tree.'' She was writing a sequel at her death, he said.         Ms. Burns and her husband, Andrew Sparks, wrote for Atlanta Weekly, a Sunday magazine once operated by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She was a freelance writer and also wrote an advice column for The Constitution under the pen name Amy Larkin. Her husband, who also had lymphoma, died of heart failure last year.         Ms. Burns majored in journalism and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1946.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, John A. Sparks of Colorado Springs, Colo.; a daughter, Becky Sparks of Atlanta, and two sisters, Margaret Turn of Bushkill, Pa., and Jean LeGrand of Conyers, Ga.       
        Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K. Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the         Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K. Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the Czechoslovak capital for more than three decades.         Victor Rabinowitz, a New York lawyer who received word of Mrs. Stern's death, said that although the cause of her death was not reported, she had recently suffered an intestinal blockage.         Martha Dodd came to public attention in 1939 when her first book, ''Through Embassy Eyes,'' was published. It told of her four years in Berlin beginning in 1933 when her father, William E. Dodd, was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Ambassador to Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power.         Then in her 20's, she was at first favorably impressed by the new leaders of Nazi Germany but her later disillusionment was reflected in her book.         In 1938, a year after her return to the United States, she married Mr. Stern, a former chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York who had inherited through an earlier marriage part of the fortune of Julius Rosenwald, the Chicago philanthropist.         In 1941, after her father's death and nine months before the United States entered World War II, Mrs. Stern and her brother, William E. Dodd Jr., published the Ambassador's diaries. Critics said that by failing to edit the comments of Germans who were opposed to Hitler they endangered the anti-Nazi underground.         Subject of McCarthy Investigation         In the last days of the war Mrs. Stern published ''Sowing the Wind,'' a novel that dealt with the moral degradation of Germans under the Nazi hierarchy.         In the early 1950's she and Mr. Stern became persistent targets of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in his anti-Communist investigations. The couple moved to Mexico City in 1953, and four years later Boris Morros, an American counterspy, testified to the House Committee on Un-American Activities that the Sternses were part of a Soviet spy network.         When they were indicted on espionage charges in 1957, the couple fled to Prague, where they settled. They later traveled to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and to Cuba but never returned to the United States. Mrs. Stern did translations of books and articles. Mr. Stern died four years ago at the age of 88.         Mrs. Stern is survived by a son, Robert, who lives in Prague.       
        Dr. Jane Cary Peck, an educator, author and a vice president of the National Council of Churches, died Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 58 years old and lived in Williamstown, Mass.         A spokesman for the Andover Newton Theological School, where she was a professor of religion, said she had died of cancer.         Dr. Peck was a graduate of Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., and earned her doctorate in social ethics at Boston University. She served on the governing board of the National Council of Churches for the past 12 years as a representative of the United Methodist Church. She participated in international conferences on ecumenical efforts for peace, justice and women's issues. In 1984, Westminster Press published her book ''Self and Family.''         This year, she traveled to Nicaragua for research for the World Council of Churches' study of ''Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation.''         She is survived by her husband, Robert; three sons, Robert of Seattle, James of Wellesley, Mass., and Jonathan of Williamstown; a daughter, Cary, of Williamstown; her mother, Ruth M. Chapman of Forsyth, Ga., and a sister, Ruth W. Hassler of Steinhatchee, Fla.       
        Nesha Bass Springer, the co-author of a 1978 guidebook on day care, died on Saturday at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass. She was 60 years old and lived in Sunapee, N.H. She died of cancer, said her son Stephen.         A graduate of Mount Holyoke College and Boston University, Mrs. Springer and her co-author, Beatrice Marden Glickman, wrote ''Who Cares for the Children?,'' published by Schocken Books. The book dealt with the pressures on young families that affect decisions about child care, as well as guidelines for choosing alternative care.         She is survived by her husband, Robert; another son, Mark, of Westwood, Mass.; two daughters, Nancy Westendorf of Vienna, W.Va., and Carrie Streim of West Hartford, Conn; a sister, Mina Goldberg of Boston, and six grandchildren.       
        Elenore Lester, a writer, editor and teacher, died Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Elenore Lester, a writer, editor and teacher, died Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lymphoma, said Roslyn Regelson, her companion of many years.         Ms. Lester, a freelance writer, wrote extensively on the arts. In such publications as The Village Voice, The New Republic and The New York Times, she helped document the emergence of the Off Off Broadway theater.         Her 1980 article for The New York Times Magazine on Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved hundreds of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis in the 1940's and who later disappeared behind the Iron Curtain, led to a book, ''Raoul Wallenberg: The Man in the Iron Web.''         Ms. Lester, a graduate of Hunter College and New York University, taught at City College, Jersey City State College and New York University. In 1973, she joined the newspaper Jewish Week as arts editor, a position she held at the time of her death.         She is survived by her husband, Jean Isenberg of Chico, Calif., and two brothers, Paul Hochstein of Los Angeles and Robert Hochstein of Washington.       
        Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Her son, David R. J. Blow, said she had died after suffering a series of strokes this week at the hospital, a geriatric facility that she entered in March. She had lived in various residences for the elderly, mainly in California, since 1983, after residing most of her earlier life in Manhattan.         The versatile Ms. Mannes was a social critic and a critic of radio, television and theater. She worked as a staff writer for the magazine The Reporter from 1952 to 1963. Her writing there included articles, essays and reviews. She even wrote satirical verse, under the pen name ''Sec.''         She did much writing over the years for The New Yorker and for other publications ranging from McCalls to The New York Times, and was the author of several books.         More Than Outspoken         Ms. Mannes's 1958 collection of essays - largely from The Reporter -was contentiously titled ''More in Anger: Some Opinions, Uncensored and Unteleprompted.'' William du Bois, reviewing it in The New York Times, said that ''to call these pages outspoken is putting things mildly.'' The book, he continued, ''is guaranteed to shock you into awareness of its author as an original thinker.''         ''Whether she is writing of the Rheingold girls or the boys in Washington,'' he observed, ''of social-minded mothers and their child victims, of the world of Miltown or the think-room at the United Nations, of the 'half-people' of our automotive age or the heirs of Senator McCarthy, she hews to the line and lets the quips fall where they may.''         For some years, Ms. Mannes was seen often on television, but she was a champion of the written word. In a speech to a gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, she once said, ''No picture on a screen can ever be an adequate substitute for the reporting of a trained observer and an honest writer.''         Marya Mannes was born on Nov. 14, 1904, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her parents were David Mannes and the former Clara Damrosch - founders of the Mannes College of Music.         She grew up in Manhattan, graduating in 1923 from Miss Veltin's School for Girls. Instead of going to college, she went to Europe for two years and studied sculpture, mainly in England.         She went on to do varied writing - including a play, ''Cafe,'' that failed on Broadway in 1930. From 1933 to 1936, she worked for Vogue magazine, as an associate editor and later as feature editor.         Wartime Analyst         During part of World War II, she was an intelligence analyst with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, she did much free-lance writing in addition to her work on The Reporter. Over the decades, 329 articles with her byline were published - 275 of them in The Reporter.         In later years she appeared on various televison programs. The Times television critic Jack Gould wrote in 1961 that ''her sustained acerbity is one of the attractive adornments of contemporary criticism.'' She also lectured across the country.         Her books include ''Out of My Time'' (1971), an autobiography; ''Message From a Stranger'' (1948) and ''They'' (1968) - both novels - and ''Subverse: Rhymes for Our Times'' (1959), a volume of satiric verse.         She was also a co-author of ''Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart'' (1972), a book about divorce. ''The Best of Marya Mannes,'' an anthology of her writing edited by Robert Mottley, was published in 1986.         In 1958 she won the George Polk Memorial Award, one of many honors given for her writing.         Her three marriages - to the set designer Jo Melziener, to Richard A. Blow, an artist, and to Christopher Clarkson, a representative of British companies - ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, who lives in San Francisco.       
        Irene Dunne had a ladylike gentility that made her naughty antics in sophisticated comedies all the more hilarious. In classic farces like ''The Awful Truth,'' in which she portrayed a worldly divorcee briefly inpersonating a gauche chorine, she delighted audiences and reviewers with her wit and elan.         Critics agreed that her artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. Miss Dunne was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and longtime popularity, an Oscar eluded her.         Colleagues regarded her as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., once a co-star, wrote that she was ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         Studied Music         Of Irish descent, Irene Dunne was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec 20. The year was 1904, according to most sources. Her father was a supervisory steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, an accomplished pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended a convent school, studied voice and piano with private teachers, sang in a church choir, attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and, after winning an arduous contest, was given a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors.         After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected for being, Miss Dunne recalled, ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in a number of minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, a milestone year, she was cast in the leading role of Magnolia for what became a hugely successful 72-week tour of Florenz Ziegfeld's production of ''Show Boat.''         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after a minor picture called ''Leathernecking'' and six months of drama lessons, she won the leading role of Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.''         Miss Dunne was cast for several years in such tragic and lachrymose roles as a hanidcapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a hugely popular tearjerker; a troubled wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she challenged a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 30's         By the mid-30's, her rich, warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline,'' the sparkling ''Roberta,'' ''Show Boat,'' and ''High, Wide and Handsome.''         Miss Dunne chose her vehicles with great care and won even greater popularity in effervescent and urbane madcap comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a daring book and tries to live up to it.In several other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying backtalk.         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her personal favorite of her 41 films.         The actress later received accolades for two major wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was the indestructible Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's King in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family in early 20th-century San Francisco in ''I Remember Mama.''         Active in Philanthropies         Miss Dunne was miscast in her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by the makeup she wore to play a frumpy elderly Queen Victoria. Her final film was ''It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952. In the 50's, she made occasional television appearances.         As her acting career became less demanding, Miss Dunne found other pursuits, away from the film industry. An active Republican, she was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairman of many philanthropies.         Miss Dunne was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter, Mary Frances.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria. In the 1950's, she made only occasional television appearances.         As she did less acting, she turned to other pursuits. She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS. ANNA         These are among the more than 40 films made by Irene Dunne during her 22-year film career:         Cimarron (1931)         Ann Vickers (1933)         Roberta (1935)         Magnificent Obsession (1935)         Show Boat (1936)         Theodora Goes Wild (1936)         The Awful Truth (1937)         Love Affair (1939)         My Favorite Wife (1940)         A Guy Named Joe (1943)         The White Cliffs of Dover (1944)         Anna and the King of Siam (1946)         Life With Father (1947)         I Remember Mama (1948)         The Mudlark (1950)       
        Helen Hammett Owen, a retired New York librarian, died on Aug. 26 at her home in Friendship, Me. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Owen died of congestive heart failure, her son, Wadsworth, said.         Mrs. Owen was an assistant supervisor for the New York Public Library from 1923 to 1930. She was a colleague of Ann Carrol Moore, the founder of the New York Children's Library System, and was a regular contributor to The New York Herald Tribune's children's book column started by Mrs. Moore. Mrs. Owen also worked with the Firehouse Children's Library Program in Harlem and the Bronx.         In 1948, Mrs. Owen moved to Old Greenwich, Conn., and worked for the Greenwich Library. She retired in 1961.         In addition to her son, of Lewes, Del., she is survived by four grandchildren and three great grand-children.       
        Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.         Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.         With her husband, Edgar Ansel Mowrer, a Pulitizer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for The Chicago Daily News, Mrs. Mowrer was close to events in Italy during the rise of Mussolini, in Germany during the rise of Hitler and in France until it fell to the Nazis in 1940.         She and Mr. Mowrer, who won his Pulitzer in 1933, were forced by the Nazis to leave Germany the same year. He died in 1977.         Mrs. Mowrer's first book, ''Journalist's Wife,'' appeared in 1937 and was promptly banned in Germany by the Nazis. Her last book, published in 1961, was ''The Indomitable John Scott: Citizen of Long Island,'' a biography of a 17th-century Colonial adventurer.         Mrs. Mowrer, who was born in England and met her husband there in 1911, also wrote theater criticism and articles on politics for such publications as Vanity Fair and Town and Country and for British newspapers.         She is survived by her daughter, Diana M. Beliard, of Chicago, and a granddaughter.       
        Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Miss Seyrig died in a hospital after a long illness, The Associated Press reported.         After her debut in ''Marienbad,'' directed by Alain Resnais, Miss Seyrig appeared in more than 30 films for many of Europe's foremost directors. Among her credits are Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' (1967), Francois Truffaut's ''Stolen Kisses'' (1968) and Luis Bunuel's ''Milky Way'' (1969) and ''Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' (1972).         She also acted in ''The Day of the Jackal'' (1973), ''A Doll's House'' (1973), ''The Black Windmill'' (1974) and ''I Sent a Letter to My Love'' (1981).         By the mid-1970's, Miss Seyrig had become an active feminist.         ''The theater and films,'' she said at the time, ''are very far from women's consciousness about themselves.''         Seeking to correct that situation, she began working with female directors. In 1975, she starred in ''India Song,'' written and directed by Marguerite Duras. In 1976, she made ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' directed by Chantal Akerman.         Miss Seyrig, who began her acting career in the theater, performed on the European stage in ''The Lover'' by Harold Pinter; in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ''Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant,'' and in Beckett's ''Play.'' She appeared on Broadway in 1972 in ''The Little Black Book.''         Miss Seyrig's marriage to the artist Jack Youngerman ended in divorce. She is survived by a son.       
        Corinna Reiman Marsh, an editor and a writer of verse and children's books, died on Monday at New York Hospital. She was 98 years and old and had lived in an apartment at Le Marquis Hotel on East 31st Street for more than 40 years before moving earlier this year to the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home.         Corinna Reiman Marsh, an editor and a writer of verse and children's books, died on Monday at New York Hospital. She was 98 years and old and had lived in an apartment at Le Marquis Hotel on East 31st Street for more than 40 years before moving earlier this year to the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home.         She died of pneumonia, a family spokeswoman, Jane Furth, said.         Throughout a long literary career Mrs. Marsh was an inveterate writer of letters to editors, authors, political figures and government agencies. She carried on extensive correspondence with figures like Eleanor Roosevelt and Adlai Stevenson. Her letters to editors were frequently published in The New York Times and other journals on a wide variety of subjects that caught her fancy.         She was a sharp critic of political polls (''fortune telling''), she opposed Sunday parades on Fifth Avenue (she lived a few steps off the avenue), and she was ever alert to catch misuse of the English language in print (she had taught English in her youth).         Crossing Words With Buckley         A decade ago Mrs. Marsh told an interviewer that she wrote to editors because ''it's important to let people know what you're thinking.'' One of the most frequent recipients of her letters was William F. Buckley Jr., whose conservatism rankled Mrs. Marsh's liberal bent.         She recalled that when the two finally met after she had been writing barb-encrusted letters to him for more than 10 years, he took her aside and said, ''I hope now you'll tell your friends I don't bite.'' To which she replied, ''And I hope you'll tell your friends that I do.''         Mrs. Marsh was born in Manhattan on Dec. 12, 1891. She was class poet at Barnard when she graduated in 1914. After teaching for several years she wrote advertising copy and children's books and for many years contributed light verse to newspapers and magazines.         For four decades she was editor in chief of the University Society, publisher of educational materials. In the last 15 years her verse and her letters to editors have been concerned mainly with debunking sentimental attitudes toward old age.         Eight years ago, when a 63-year-old man wrote The New York Times to urge his contemporaries to face the fact that ''old is old is old,'' Mrs. Marsh took pen to reply:         ''Old at 63? People of that age 'senile, incompetent, deteriorated'? Maybe. But because of their age? ''I am 91 years of age and am fortunate enough still to have a goodly number of contemporaneous pals. Some of us may not see or hear or walk as well as we used to but, by golly, we are alert, interested, amused and amusing, as well as busy.''         Among her books are ''Flippy's Flashlight'' a children's book published by Dutton in 1958.         Mrs. Marsh is survived by a grandson, a great-grandson and several cousins.       
        Dr. Jane Bennett Ross, an anthropologist, died on Oct. 11 at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 44 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Jane Bennett Ross, an anthropologist, died on Oct. 11 at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 44 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said her sister Judy Bennett of San Francisco.         Dr. Ross, who earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University, was a teaching assistant with Margaret Mead from 1969 to 1972. She studied primitive warfare among the Achuara Jivaro Indians in northwestern Peru for two years. Her research on human aggression is the subject of a new book, ''The Balance of Deaths'' (University of Arizona Press).         She had also taught at Brooklyn and Mount Holyoke Colleges and Fordham and New York Universities.         Also surviving are her parents, Warren and Mary Bennett of Sarasota, Fla., and another sister, Anne Tremaine of Oakland, Calif.       
         Elisabeth H. Woodburn, one of the country's best-known dealers in rare books on horticulture, died yesterday at her home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Woodburn died of a heart attack, family members said.         Mrs. Woodburn once described herself as a "lifelong gardener." She said she derived the name of her book dealership, Booknoll Farm, "from the fact that in 1950 I moved the horses and sheep out of the old barn and converted it to make room for me and my 13,000 books on gardening."         In 1983, her collection included the first herbal produced in this hemisphere, an Aztec document from 1550, and the first herbal written in English, a two-volume set published in 1739.         By 1985, she said her collection was up to 14,000 volumes, even though she had just sold her substantial library of wine books. But she kept a section on grape-growing in her catalogue of horticulture literature.         Mrs. Woodburn was a founding member and a former president of the Antiquarian Booksellers of America, and a founding member of the Council of Botanical and Horticultural Libraries. She was also co-chairwoman of the Library Advisory Committee of the New York Botanical Garden.         She is survived by her husband, Keith C. Robertson; two daughters, Hope E. Robertson of Stockton, N.J., and Christina H. Robertson of Philadelphia; a son, Jeffrey K. Robertson of Hopewell, and her brother, Peter Hexter of Newtown, Pa.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Carol Sobieski, a film and television writer who was widely praised for her sensitive characterizations in original or adapted works, died on Sunday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 51 years old.         She died of amyloidosis, a blood plasma disease, the Writers Guild of America said.         Mrs. Sobieski's film credits include the scripts for John Huston's 1982 version of the Broadway musical "Annie," "Casey's Shadow" (1978), "Sylvester" (1984) and "Winter People" (1988).         Three of her television scripts won awards from the Writers Guild of America: "The Neon Ceiling" (1971), about a woman and her daughter, who stop at a desert diner and meet its alcoholic manager; "Sunshine" (1973), about a dying young woman who leaves audio tapes for the 3-year-old daughter who might otherwise forget her, and a sequel, "Christmas Sunshine" (1977). Emmy Nominations and a Prize         "Plain Speaking," Mrs. Sobieski's 1976 adaptation of Merle Miller's book about Harry S. Truman, won Emmy nominations for best script and best program, and a best-actor award for Ed Flanders.         Carol O'Brien Sobieski was born in Chicago and grew up in Amarillo, Tex. She graduated with honors from Smith College and earned a master's degree from Trinity College in Dublin.         She moved to Los Angeles in 1964. Among the movies she wrote for television are "Amelia Earhart (1976)," "The Women's Room (1980)," "Where the Ladies Go (1980)" and "The Bourne Identity (1988)." In writing "Amelia Earhart" she drew on her own experiences as a licensed pilot, and in "Casey's Shadow" and "Sylvester" on her longtime involvement with horses as a trainer, rider and teacher.         Mrs. Sobieski is survived by her husband, James; two daughters, Emmy, of Seattle, and Mona, of Santa Monica; a son, Jamie, of Stockton, Calif., and a sister, Wendy Marsh of Amarillo.       
         Anya Seton, the author of several popular historical and biographical novels, two of which were made into successful films, died on Thursday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She had been ill for several years and died of heart failure, a daughter, Pamela Cottier Forcey, said.         Miss Seton developed a devoted following from the 1940's to the 1970's for her carefully researched and evocative works, two of which, "Dragonwyck" and "Foxfire," were made into successful films. She won critical praise for her attention to the language and life style of the periods she wrote about, but she was frequently faulted for reworking familiar ground.  A First Book at 37         The daughter of a celebrated English author, artist and naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, and an American writer of travel books, Grace Gallatin, Miss Seton did not produce her first successful book until she was 37 years old. She had married the first of her two husbands when she was 18 and raised three children before turning seriously to writing.         She began selling short stories to newspapers -- her first brought her a check for $5 -- and in the late 1930's became interested in the story of Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia, a celebrated beauty of her time who died mysteriously.         Miss Seton decided to apply a fictional treatment to the woman's life and the result was "My Theodosia," published in 1941 and well received by critics and the public.         "Dragonwyck," her second published novel, gained international recognition. A Gothic tale set along the Hudson River in the 1840's, it was serialized by the Ladies' Home Journal, selected by the Dollar Book Club, translated into nine languages and made into a film starring Vincent Price as a feudal overlord who tyrannizes his tenant farmers, kills his wife and takes up with a distant relative, played by Gene Tierney. Role for Vincent Price         The film, released in 1946, was adapted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was his first directorial effort; it established him as a major force in movies and set a villainous style for Mr. Price that he was to repeat many times.         That year Miss Seton followed with "The Turquoise," a novel of the American Southwest in the 1890's, inspired by visits to her father's ranch in New Mexico. Two years later came "The Hearth and the Eagle," set in Marblehead on the Massachusetts coast.         For each of her books, Miss Seton spent a good deal of time getting to know the locale about which she was writing.         "It is impossible for me to describe or 'feel' any place to which I have not been," she once said. "I am inspired by places." "Dragonwyck," "The Turquoise," "The Hearth and the Eagle" and "Foxfire," the latter set in an Arizona ghost town and made into a 1955 film starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, all resulted from visits to places which, Miss Seton said, "suddenly became meaningful." Dark Romances         But her favorite books were her biographical novels. Besides "My Theodosia" these included "Katherine" (1954), the story of the mistress of John of Gaunt; "The Winthrop Woman" (1958), about the niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, and "Devil Water" (1962), "Avalon" (1965) and "Green Darkness" (1973), all of which take place in England and tell of dark romances.         Miss Seton was born in Manhattan and raised in Cos Cob, Conn., where her family had an estate. She was christened Ann, but a family friend, a Sioux chief, gave her the Indian name Anutika, which her family adapted to Anya. She traveled extensively with her parents; by the time she was 13 she had crossed the Atlantic eight times. She had private tutors much of the time but graduated from the Spence School.         Miss Seton was twice married and divorced. Her son, Seton Cottier, died in 1979. She is survived by Mrs. Forcey, who lives in Manhattan, and another daughter, Clemency Chase Coggins of Auburndale, Mass.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a scholar of Jewish life and history whose book "The War Against the Jews" is widely regarded as a pioneering study of the Nazi genocide, died early Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, the daughter of Polish immigrants, was at the center of the study of the modern Jewish experience at Yeshiva University, where she held a chair in interdisciplinary Holocaust studies. Early in her career, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, she went to Europe, where she helped Jewish survivors of the war to re-create schools and libraries, and she recovered vast collections of books seized by the Nazis.         Before that, while in her early 20's, she had lived in Vilna, Poland, from 1938 to 1939, where she witnessed the onslaught of European anti-Semitism, writing about the experience in a memoir, "From That Place and Time," published by W. W. Norton last year. Her other books include "The Jewish Presence" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich) in 1977 and "The Holocaust and the Historians" (Harvard University Press), a critical survey of scholarship on the Holocaust, in 1981. Hopes Turn to Agonies         "There was a certain irony to my trip to Vilna," Mrs. Dawidowicz told an interviewer for Publisher's Weekly last year, speaking of her pre-war experience in Poland. "I went there with the romantic belief that it might become the world center for a self-sustaining Yiddish culture."         When she saw what turned out to be the beginning of the end of Jewish life in Poland, she immersed herself in Yiddish literature and Jewish history, so that she could help to preserve Jewish culture in the postwar world.         Mrs. Dawidowicz (pronounced dah-vee-DOH-vich), a small energetic woman who spoke in the accents of the Bronx, engaged in heated arguments within Jewish circles over both the nature of the Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent it.         Her major work, "The War Against the Jews," postulates that the destruction of the Jews was a central and inescapable element in Nazi ideology and was always a principle war aim of Hitler, just as important as his military conquest of Europe. In this view, she conflicted with other historians, who believed that the Holocaust was not a necessary part of the Nazi program but evolved in response to such circumstances as the defeats on the Eastern front.  Evidence Over Passion         "The War Against the Jews" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston) was called "a work of high scholarship and profound moral import" by Irving Howe, in his review in The New York Times Book Review. It is marked above all by its sobriety. Mrs. Dawidowicz allows the coolly accumulated weight of detail -- the growing force of the Nazi's anti-Semitic juggernaut, the evolution of the camps as places of scientific murder, the efforts by the victims to hold onto fragments of normal life -- to create its emotional and intellectual impact.         Mrs. Dawidowicz refused to judge the failure of the Jews themselves to mount a more active resistance to the genocide, and in this she clashed bitterly with a number of other historians.         Her belief was twofold. First, she felt it morally inappropriate for those who did not face the persecutions themselves to criticize the behavior of those who did. Second, she felt that in any case, Jewish resistance was doomed to failure. Given the Jews' isolation, their lack of arms and the overwhelming material superiority of their enemies, there was virtually nothing they could have done to alter their fate, she wrote.  Defended Role of Jews         In her book "The Holocaust and the Historians," Mrs. Davidowicz is critical of a number of historians and commentators -- Bruno Bettelheim, Hannah Arendt and Raul Hilberg are among those she mentions -- who described the European Jews during the war as passive, cowardly or, in the case of the Judenrat, set up by the Nazis as self-governing boards in the ghettos, even collaborationist.         Similarly, Mrs. Dawidowicz rejected a chorus of opinion to the effect that Jews in the United States were guilty of complacency and a failure to react effectively to the Holocaust.         In articles in Commentary magazine and The New York Times, she wrote, first, that the Jews here did undertake wipespread efforts to awaken the government and world opinion to the fate of the European Jews. Second, she argued that, in any case, whatever might have been done here, the Jews of Europe were caught in a vise from which virtually no escape was ever possible. The only way to save them, she believed, was to militarily defeat the Nazis as quickly as possible, and that fact justified the Allies' concentration on the war effort, rather than on efforts to save the Jews.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, whose maiden name was Lucy Schildkret, was born in New York in 1915 and educated at Hunter College and Columbia University. She recounts in "From That Time and Place" how she began to work for YIVO's Manhattan branch after her year in Vilna. She met her husband, Szymon Dawidowicz, an escapee from Poland there. Mr. Dawidowicz died in 1979.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, who had no children, is survived by her sister, Eleanor Sapak.       
         Carol E. Rinzler, a lawyer and author, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old. She had suffered a neck injury recently, but the cause of her death was not immediately determined, her family said.         Ms. Rinzler pursued a dual career as a specialist in publishing law and as a writer who dealt in lighthearted fashion with childhood and adolescence. She was the author of "Nobody Said You Had to Eat Off the Floor," published in 1971; "The Girl Who Got All the Breaks" (1980), and "Your Adolescent: An Owner's Manual" (1981).         In the "owner's manual," addressed to people who find living with an adolescent more painful than adolescence itself, Ms. Rinzler offered advice like: "An adolescent who is cheerful at breakfast should be kept home from school that day."         Ms. Rinzler was born in Newark and was a graduate of Goucher College. She received her law degree from Yale and was with the Manhattan law firms of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Rembar & Curtis before establishing her own practice earlier this year.         She was a contributing editor of Publishers Weekly, a book critic and columnist for Mademoiselle and Cosmopolitan magazines, and a writer of reviews and articles for The New York Times Book Review and other publications.         Ms. Rinzler is survived by her father, Irving Eisen, of Mount Pleasant, S.C.; a son, Michael, and a daughter, Jane, both of Manhattan.       
         Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.         Miss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in "Bulldog Drummond" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in "Disraeli" (1929) and John Barrymore in "Moby Dick" (1930).         She portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in "Me and My Gal" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in "Little Women" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in "Private Worlds" (1935).         The leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made "Algiers," a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called "Trade Winds," and she began an entirely new career.         A Change of Personality         Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- "The House Across the Bay" and "The Man I Married" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in "Man Hunt" (1941), a mysterious model in "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in "Scarlet Street" (1946).         She also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's "Macomber Affair" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's "Woman on the Beach" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's "Reckless Moment" (1949).         Then, easily shifting images again, she was an elegant, witty and nurturing mother in two classic film comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli: "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951), co-starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.         Later in 1951, Miss Bennett was a principal in a major Hollywood scandal. Mr. Wanger shot and wounded her longtime agent, Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot, accusing him of being a home wrecker. Miss Bennett later attributed her husband's outburst to desperation over large financial losses.         To avoid further notoriety, Mr. Wanger pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served 100 days at a minimum-security prison farm. Mr. Lang soon recovered, but Miss Bennett's film career did not. Before the shooting, she had starred in more than 60 movies. After it, at the age of 41, she was offered only a handful of roles.         Bad Timing         In a 1981 interview, she contrasted the judgmental 1950's with the sensation-crazed 70's and 80's. "It would never happen that way today," she said, laughing. "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures."         The Wangers divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage.         As movie offers dwindled, Miss Bennett turned to the stage and made successful national tours in such plays as "Susan and God," "Bell, Book and Candle," "Once More With Feeling," "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Never Too Late."         She also lent her presence and prestige to television's top gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," which ran from 1966 to 1971 and attracted a major cult following. The series, which also dealt with a guilt-ridden vampire (Jonathan Frid), has been frequently rebroadcast.         Associates invariably applauded Miss Bennett for professionalism and dedication. In her 1970 autobiography, "The Bennett Playbill," written with Lois Kibbee, she said her experience with "Dark Shadows," in which she played the mistress of a haunted mansion, had given her new regard for daytime television performers.         Miss Bennett was celebrated for not taking herself too seriously. In 1986, she remarked, "I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much."         Theatrical Lineage         Joan Bennett was born on Feb. 27, 1910, in Palisades, N.J. Her parents were Richard Bennett, a flamboyant matinee idol, and Adrienne Morrison, an actress whose lineage went back five generations to strolling players in 18th-century England. The couple's elder daughters, Constance and Barbara, also became actresses.         Miss Bennett attended St. Margaret's, a boarding school in Waterbury, Conn., and L'Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France. At the age of 16, she married John Marion Fox, whom she later described as a playboy and drunkard. At 17, she had a daughter, Diana, and at 18, she divorced Mr. Fox.         That same year, her father got her the ingenue role in a Broadway melodrama, "Jarnegan," in which he starred as a lecherous, brawling movie director. She received good notices, and after a five-month run, he helped her get her first movie contract. She soon succeeded in "Bulldog Drummond" and over the next decade starred in 33 films. Her major early setback was a final-round loss of the role of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh.         About Hollywood in the 1930's, Miss Bennett recalled: "The industry held a combination of nuts, talents, charlatans and geniuses, all of whom were learning, bumbling and creating with fury and innocence. The colorful types had a passionate love for the business, not just for the money. Today, it seems to me, it's strictly a big business, based on dollars and cents."         Miss Bennett is survived by her fourth husband, David Wilde, a former critic and publisher whom she married in 1973; four daughters, Diana Anderson of Los Angeles and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y., from her second marriage to Gene Markey, a film writer-producer whom she married in 1932 and divorced in 1937, and Stephanie Guest and Shelley Wanger, both of Manhattan, from her marriage to Mr. Wanger, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Alice Marble, a Californian who grudgingly gave up baseball and grew into America's No. 1 female tennis player by winning the United States women's amateur singles title four times between 1936 and 1940, died yesterday at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. Miss Marble, a longtime resident of Palm Desert, Calif., was 77 years old.         Miss Marble, who suffered from pernicious anemia, according to her sister-in-law, Bernice Marble of San Francisco, was admitted to the hospital on Saturday and died at 1:35 A.M. yesterday. A hospital spokesman, Randy Bevilacqua, gave no cause of death.         To achieve her stature as the golden-haired queen of women's tennis, Miss Marble had to overcome obstacles. Born on Sept. 13, 1913, in the lumber town of Beckwith in the Sierra Nevadas, she left with her parents and three brothers at the age of 5 to grow up in San Francisco, a chubby girl athlete, adept at boxing, baseball and basketball. Turned to Tennis at 15         Her athletic skills were not turned to tennis until the age of 15. The former Little Queen of Swat learned the game quickly in Golden Gate Park. After winning many junior tournaments in California, her progress was slowed in 1933 by a case of sunstroke after she played 108 games of tennis in one day at East Hampton, L.I.         Then, in 1934, she suffered a complete collapse during a French-American series of matches at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris, which led to a diagnosis of pleurisy. She required a year of rest in a sanitarium, causing her to miss most of the 1934 and 1935 seasons.         When she applied to play in the national amateur championship at Forest Hills in 1936, the tournament committee refused to accept her entry, saying she was unfit to play and might permanently jeopardize her health. But after practicing a week, Miss Marble persuaded the committee to accept her entry and she went on to win her first national championship. Ranked No. 1 in 1936-1940         As the No. 1-ranked woman from 1936 to 1940, she dominated the game. She won the United States singles title again in 1938, 1939 and 1940 and the women's singles at Wimbledon in 1939.         With Sarah Palfrey Fabyan she won the United States women's doubles championships from 1937 through 1940 and the mixed-doubles title with Gene Mako in 1936, with Donald Budge in 1938, with Harry Hopman in 1939 and with Bobby Riggs in 1940. At Wimbledon, she also won the women's doubles in 1938 and 1939 with Mrs. Fabyan and the mixed doubles with Budge in 1937 and 1938 and with Riggs in 1939.         In 1939, she had won the singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles at both Forest Hills and Wimbledon and in 1940 she was undefeated. As a member of four winning Wightman Cup teams in matches against Britain during the 1930's she lost only one match in singles and one in doubles. Aided by a Coach         After her illness, Miss Marble was aided by the coaching of Eleanor Tennant, who made changes in her strokes. Miss Marble played an all-out athletic game complete with strong volleys and smashes. She was also adept at the twist serve and possessed a strong backhand. She was unusually quick on her feet and used her speed to good advantage while attacking the net.         Jack Kramer, a member of the Tennis Hall of Fame, said yesterday of Miss Marble: "She was the lady who most changed the style of play for women. She introduced the aggressive and athletic style that has led down to the female stars of today like Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf."         "Alice Marble was a picture of unrestrained athleticism," said Billie Jean King. "She is remembered as one of the greatest women to play the game because of her pioneering style in power tennis. I also admired her tremendously because she always helped others." Became a Pro After 1940         After her conquests of 1939 and 1940, Miss Marble renounced her amateur standing and turned professional. Since there were no professional tournaments for women, she played a series of exhibitions until the outbreak of World War II, when she enlisted in the Hale America movement to assist in improving the physical condition of women and youngsters.         She also played exhibition tennis matches to entertain servicemen and to promote the sales of war bonds. She was inducted into the Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., in 1964 with Donald Budge, her former mixed-doubles partner.         In 1946 she published a book "The Road to Wimbledon." She said she wrote it "because of so many requests from friends and fans who asked me to tell them the secret of success." Autobiography to Be Published         After the war, she continued to play exhibition matches and give tennis clinics in the United States and abroad. She also designed sportswear and traveled as a lecturer.         Her autobiogrpahy, "Courting Danger," written with Dale Leatherman, is scheduled for publication in June 1991, by St. Martin's Press.         In it, according to Miss Leatherman, Miss Marble writes of her marriage to Joe Crowley, an Army pilot who was shot down and killed over Germany during World War II. She also told of accepting an assignment as a spy for Army Intelligence in 1945 to gather information in Switzerland about German financial accounts. During the operation, she was shot in the back, but was rescued by her military intelligence contact and recovered. She was told not to mention the operation to anyone after the war.         Asked at a news conference in 1984 if she had any regrets about her tennis career, Miss Marble said, "I did not get to see myself on television and I did not get to play the tie breaker."       
         Ilse Bischoff, an illustrator and writer, died on Dec. 5 at her home in Hartland, Vt. She was 89 years old.         She died of Parkinson's disease, said her agent, David Stewart Hull.         She illustrated 12 books, published from 1928 and 1946. She wrote two novels about George Washington's portraitist, Gilbert Stuart: "Proud Heritage" (1949) and "Painter's Coach" (1943). Her autobiography was titled "Drive Slowly: Six Dogs" (1953). That same year, a children's book she wrote and illustrated, "The Wonderful Poodle," was published.         She studied in Munich, Germany, and at the Art Students League in New York City.
