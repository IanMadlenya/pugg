         Eleanor Schley Todd, a former Republican National Committeewoman, died on Monday at her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.         She was also active in civic affairs. In 1983, Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Board of Higher Education, where she served until 1988. She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.         Mrs. Todd was born in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and was educated at the Chapin School, the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., Barnard and Sarah Lawrence Colleges and at Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1967.         She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Ada Moore, a singer and actress who performed on Broadway and in jazz clubs across the nation, died on Sunday at the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 64 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of cancer, her husband, Paul J. Ash, said.         Miss Moore, who was born in Chicago, attended the University of California at Los Angeles, and began her singing career in that city. In 1954, she created the role of Gladiola in the Truman Capote and Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers."         She sang at many jazz and supper clubs, including the Village Vanguard, the Hungry I in San Francisco and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, and at such theaters as the Apollo in New York, the Howard in Washington and the Royal in Baltimore.         In the 1970's, Miss Moore wrote prose and poetry and published a newsletter, The American Negro Woman. In an article about Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington and Billie Holiday, Miss Moore wrote: "They were not just blues singers, they were innovators who took experience directly from the harsh and dynamic areas of life, refined it and gave it the form and beauty that moved us so much."         Her only survivor is her husband, who is executive vice president of the Sam Ash Music Corporation.         Correction:  January 11, 1991, Friday         An obituary in some copies yesterday about Ada Moore, a singer and actress, misstated her relationship to Paul J. Ash. He is her former husband, not her husband. A corrected obituary appears today on page B7.       
         Herta Prager, former chief librarian of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer of the colon and the liver, said her daughter, Katharine P. Darrow of Brooklyn.         Mrs. Prager, a native of Fiume, Austria-Hungary, now Yugoslavia, received a doctorate from the University of Munich before coming to the United States in 1935. She received a law degree at the University of Chicago, practiced law in Chicago and studied at the library school of the university.         She became law librarian at Northwestern University and a bureau head at the New Jersey State Library before orking at the Court of Appeals, from 1974 to 1980. She continued to work at the library after retiring.         Mrs. Prager was the widow of Frank Prager, a patent lawyer. Surviving are a daughter, Katharine P. Darrow, who is vice president of The New York Times Company for broadcasting, information services and corporate development; a sister, Marion Schild of Brooklyn, a retired librarian at the Library of Congress, and three grandchildren.       
         Mary Francis Shura Craig, a writer of mystery novels and children's books, died on Saturday at the Loyola University Medical Burn Center in Maywood, Ill. She was 67 years old and lived in Hinsdale, Ill.         She died of injuries suffered in a fire in her apartment on Dec. 13, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Craig, who was a recipient of the Carl Sandburg Literary Arts Award in 1985, was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America last year. She wrote children's books under the name Mary Francis Shura and dozens of adult books and mystery novels under the names M. S. Craig, Mary Francis Craig and Meredith Hill.       
         Ruth McAneny Loud, a former president of the Municipal Arts Society, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after emergency surgery for an ulcer, her daughter, Margaret Faron, said.         Mrs. Loud, a native and lifelong resident of Manhattan, was active in civic affairs for several decades. She was a daughter of George McAneny, who was Manhattan Borough President from 1910 to 1913 and president of the New York City Board of Alderman from 1914 to 1916. She was a graduate of the Brearley School and of Bryn Mawr.         After teaching at Brearley from 1929 to 1946, Mrs. Loud became director of the development office of the Museum of the City of New York. In 1965 she was elected president of the Municipal Arts Society and remained a member of its board of directors until her death.         She was co-author with Agnes Wales of "New York! New York! A Knickerbocker Holiday for You and Your Children" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1946).         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Summit, N.J., Mrs. Loud is survived by a son, Roger, of Lake Placid, N.Y.; a sister, Elisabeth Harrison of Rumson, N.J.; three brothers, Herbert McAneny of Princeton, N.J., Ernest McAneny of New York City and David McAneny of Newtown Square, Pa.; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Marie Provaznik, a leader of the nationalist Sokol gymnastics movement in Czechoslovakia who defected to the United States after directing the Czechoslovak women's contingent at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, died on Jan. 11 at St. Clair's Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y. She was 100 years old, and her family said she suffered a stroke two weeks earlier.         As the leader of 500,000 women in the Czechoslovak Sokol organizations after World War II, Mrs. Provaznik was regarded in her homeland as a national heroine.         Sokol, the Czech word for falcon, symbolizing freedom, was established in 1863 to combine athletics suggestive of an army in training with national democractic resistance. Allowed to Keep Position         At the time of her defection in 1948, the year a Communist Government took over her country, Mrs. Provaznik was president of the women's divisions of both the Czechoslovak gymnastics organization and the International Gymnastics Federation in Geneva.         She was also such a popular figure that when the nation's Sokol leaders were arrested after the Communist takeover Mrs. Provaznik was allowed to retain her position.         Indeed, even after she announced that she would not return to Czechoslovakia after the 1948 Summer Games because "it is the only way to be a free agent," a spokesman for the Czechoslovak Embassy in London praised her as a "fine instructor" and an "outstanding athlete," and declared that she was going to the United States "with the blessing and knowledge of Prague."  Taught in New Jersey         In the United States, Mrs. Provaznik, who became an American citizen in 1954, taught physical education at Panzer College in New Jersey, and was active in Sokols established in New York and elsewhere.         Mrs. Provaznik, whose husband, Frantisek, died in 1948, is survived by a daughter, Dr. Alena Polesny, of Altamont, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jeanne A. Henabery, a public relations specialist in the beauty and fashion field, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, her husband, Robert, said.         Mrs. Henabery was president of Jeanne Henabery Associates, a public relations firm she started in 1970, and was also affiliated with her husband in his broadcast consulting company, Bob Henabery Associates.         She attended Bryant and Simmons College and also took courses at the School of Visual Arts, the Fashion Institute, Baruch College and the Herbert Berghof Studio. She began her career in the public relations department of the General Electric Company in Pittsfield, Mass., and was later with public-relations concerns in Detroit and in New York City.       
         With reminiscences and some of her favorite songs, friends of Mary Martin gathered at the Majestic Theater yesterday afternoon to celebrate her life.         Miss Martin, who died of cancer in November at the age of 76, was recalled as a high-spirited artist who personified some of her signature roles; the eternal child in "Peter Pan," the "cockeyed optimist" in "South Pacific," the ebullient and nurturing protector in "The Sound of Music."         "She was the greatest figure we're ever going to have in musical comedy," said Helen Hayes. She quickly amended the announcement to include Ethel Merman. "Mary would rap me over the knuckles in heaven when I got there," she said, if she did not cite Miss Merman.         Miss Hayes remembered a trip with Miss Martin 35 years ago to Paris, where they were to perform in "The Skin of Our Teeth." Miss Martin took along grand clothes, she recalled, and as they walked through the city one day, "suddenly overhead there was a swoosh of birds," one of whom "took perfect aim on Mary."         "I didn't know her too well," she said, and she feared Miss Martin would "have hysterics" at the marring of her outfit. But, Miss Hayes said, there was Miss Martin "looking at me with a sort of half-smile, and she said, 'For some people, they         sing.'         That was the beginning of our friendship." Gold Dust From the Air         Van Johnson told of the time Miss Martin decided to stage a benefit for a hospital where she had been recovering from a 1982 automobile accident. To his horror, he saw her putting on a harness to reprise a number from "Peter Pan." "I said, 'Mary, you're         not!' "         he recounted, "and she said, 'Oh, yes, I am, and I may not come back.' And she zoomed up to the roof and sprinkled gold dust all over our hair."         Recalling the same car accident and another sign of the artist's indomitable temperament, Florence Henderson cited a time when Miss Martin, still a patient, was given a walker, an object she had apparently never encountered. She took it on a promenade down the corridor. Other people smiled, and she smiled back, Ms. Henderson recalled, adding that "she was         carrying         the walker."         She described Miss Martin as "truly the purest soul that I have ever known," adding, "She was so generous; she always let people into her circle of light." As for artistry, Ms. Henderson recalled a tribute that Miss Merman had made, in her fashion. Asked by a reporter what she had thought of Miss Martin's performance at the opening of "South Pacific," Ms. Henderson said, Miss Merman snapped, "Oh, she's all right, if you like talent.' " New Lyrics to a Favorite Song         In one of several videotapes shown, Miss Martin and Miss Merman were seen singing a medley, alternating, performing together and gradually turning the duet into a mock competition.         Carol Channing performed a tribute to Miss Martin that put new words to "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," the song that propelled Miss Martin to Broadway success in 1938 in Cole Porter's "Leave It To Me." "She played a nurse/She played a nun/She played a boy who was a fairy," Ms. Channing sang. "She stopped the show when she had to crow/And our hearts belong to Mary."         Other participants included the performers John Raitt, Carol Lawrence and Kathleen Nolan and the choreographer Jerome Robbins. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent remarks in a videotape. Miss Martin's son, the actor Larry Hagman, and daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, introduced the program.         The event concluded with a 1983 videotape of Miss Martin singing a song from "Peter Pan." The tape's final image, of the artist with her arms outstretched, remained on the screen as participants in the memorial returned to the stage to applaud it.       
         Charlotte L. Peskin, chairwoman and president of Polyplastex United, a producer of interiors for aircraft cabins, died on Tuesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 76 years old and lived in Tamarac, Fla.         She died of peritonitis after surgery, her family said.         Mrs. Peskin was the daughter of Louis Schnitzer, founder of the Yiddish Art Theater in New York, and his wife, Henriette, a noted actress on the Yiddish stage. Mrs. Peskin was a child actress before attending Pratt Institute, where she received a degree in art.         A longtime resident of Brooklyn and West Hempstead, L.I., Mrs. Peskin became secretary of Polyplastex, a publicly held family concern, in 1963. She was named chairwoman and president two years ago.         She is survived by her husband, Sidney, also an officer of Polyplastex; two sons, Roger, of Milford, N.J., and Dennis, of Tarpon Springs, Fla., who are also Polyplastex officers, and three granddaughters.       
         Ruth Dietz, who headed the Woolen Corporation of America in the 1950's, died on Monday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Dietz, a native of Manhattan, took over direction of the Woolen Corporation in 1950 on the death of her first husband, Louis Surut, who founded the concern in 1920.         In 1952 she married Arthur O. Dietz, president of the CIT Financial Corporation, who died in 1967.         Mrs. Dietz is survived by a daughter, Elaine Fenton of Manhattan; a son, Lee E. Surut of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, Monroe Rubinger of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ralph Rubinger of Palm Beach, Fla.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Sylvia Weiner Leiferman, an artist, philanthropist and president of the Leiferman Investment Company, died on Thursday at the Heartland of Miami Lakes, a nursing home in North Miami, Fla. She was 77 years old and lived in Bal Harbour, Fla.         She died of a respiratory ailment, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Leiferman was a major contributor to Yeshiva University, and last year, she and her husband, Irwin, gave $1 million to endow the main gallery at the Yeshiva University Museum.         She was a founder of Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach and a trustee of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation. She was also a substantial contributor to Hebrew University in Jerusalem and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa.         She is survived by her husband, who is the chairman of Hamilton Industries.       
         Adele Lawrence Auchincloss, an artist, environmentalist and former deputy administrator of the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, died on Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of bone marrow cancer, her husband, the writer Louis Auchincloss, said.         Mrs. Auchincloss, a past president of the New York Parks Council and of the Park Association, was appointed deputy administrator of parks in 1974 by Mayor Abraham D. Beame and served for one year, until the post fell victim to the city's fiscal crisis.         A 1953 graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she also attended the Parsons School of Design. She was a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York Botanical Garden. In 1980, she was president of the Central Park Task Force.         She designed covers for her husband's novels and was the co-author of a forthcoming centennial history of the New York Botanical Garden.         Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, John and Andrew, both lawyers, of Manhattan, and Blake, an architect, of Mansfield, Mass; a sister, Susan Winchester of Prides Crossing, Mass., and one granddaughter.       
         Aryness Joy Wickens, an economist and statistician who played the crucial role in developing the Government's cost-of-living index, now the Consumer Price Index, died last Saturday at the Lakeland Health Care Center in Jackson, Miss. She was 90 years old and lived in Jackson.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wickens retired from the Department of Labor in 1970 after a 42-year career in Fderal service that began when she joined the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in 1928 after having taught at Mount Holyoke College for four years.         In 1933 she served on a committee organized by the American Statistical Association to advise Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins on setting up the Bureau of Labor Statistics program. A few years later she directed the bureau's studies for the Temporary National Economic Committee's investigation of monopolistic practices in industry.         When the bureau was reorganized in 1940, Mrs. Wickens became chief of the branch studying prices and the cost of living. From 1946 to 1961 she was assistant and then deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics.         In 1952 she was president of the American Statistical Association. Eight years later, in recognition of her outstanding Government service, she was one of six recipients of the first Federal Women's Awards of the Civil Service Commission. Adviser at U.N. Conferences         In 1961, after having been a United States adviser at many United Nations and other international conferences, Mrs. Wickens was named economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor. In that post she laid the statistical base for what became the department's Manpower Administration and its Employment and Training Administration.         After retirement Mrs. Wickens served on the advisory board of the United States Export-Import Bank. In 1976 she returned to government work as director of statistical studies for the Commission on Federal Paperwork.         Mrs. Wickens was born in Bellingham, Wash. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington and held a master's degree from the University of Chicago. She lived near Vienna, Va., before moving to Jackson four years ago.         Her husband, David L. Wickens, an economist, died in 1970. She is survived by a son, Donaldson, of Jackson, and three grandsons.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.

         Grace Hartley Jenkins Mead, a philanthropist and trustee emeritus of Columbia University's Teachers College, died on Wednesday at her home in Morristown, N.J. She was 95 years old and also had residences in Norfolk, Conn., and St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.         She died of heart failure, a grandson, Nicolas W. Platt, said.         She was appointed a trustee of Teachers College in 1934 and later was named trustee emeritus. From 1940 to 1965 she was president of Hartley House, a settlement house on West 46th Street that was named for her great-grandfather, Robert Milham Hartley, a New York civic leader.         For more than 40 years, Mrs. Mead was president of the Hartley Corporation, a philathropic foundation that has contributed to charitable and educational institutions.         She was born in Morristown, the daughter of George W. Jenkins, president of the family-owned Remington Arms Company, and Helen Hartley Jenkins, a benfactor of Columbia University. Mrs. Mead and her cousin, Marcellus Hartley Dodge, were major donors to a building program at Columbia that included the M. H. Dodge gym, Hartley Hall and the gates at Barnard.         Her husband, Winter Mead, an executive for the Prudential Life Insurance Company, died in 1953.         She is survived by a daughter, Helen Hartley Mead Platt of Madison, N.J..; a son, Robert Hartley Mead of Norfolk, Conn., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Ruth Shatz, a cattle breeder and civic leader, died on Sunday at her home in Coral Gables, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She died in her sleep, a family spokeswoman said.         Before moving to Florida in 1955, Mrs. Shatz and her late husband, Hyman, operated Phileidor Farms in Carmel, N.Y., where they bred prize Guernsey cows. Mrs. Shatz also served as vice president and director of the Mahopac Hospital, now known as the Putnam Hospital Center in Carmel, and was active in the Red Cross. After moving to Florida, she served as treasurer of the Palm Society, an international organization of horticulturists. She also translated several books into Braille.         She is survived by two daughters, Dorothy Lonergan of Miami, and Eileen Oseroff of Rochester, ; a son, Phillip, of Freedom Plains, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Martha Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of this century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Miss Graham died of cardiac arrest after being treated for two months for pneumonia, said Ron Protas, general director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Miss Graham had become ill in December after a 55-day tour of the Far East with her troupe. She entered the hospital on Jan. 15 and returned home two weeks ago.         Frequently ranked with Picasso, Stravinsky and James Joyce for developing a form of expression that broke the traditional mold, Miss Graham was initially acclaimed as a great dancer. Masterworks and Invention         Yet ultimately her genius -- universally recognized as she became the most honored figure in American dance -- was embodied in her choreographic masterworks and her invention of a new and codified dance language.         The Graham technique, which is now used by dance companies throughout the world, became the first enduring alternative to the idiom of classical ballet. Powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension, this vocabulary combined with Miss Graham's distinctive system of training to set her above other dance innovators.         Although such achievements were part of Miss Graham's multi-faceted pioneering role in helping to establish modern dance outside the older ballet tradition after the 1920's, she continued to amaze her public for more than 60 years. She choreographed more than 180 works. The most recent was her self-mocking "Maple Leaf Rag," which had its premiere on Oct. 2 with the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.         Throughout her career, Miss Graham's fundamental tenet was that dance should reach audiences through a visceral response rather than an objective image that registered upon the intellect. "Out of emotion comes form," she said, and then proved that out of form she could re-create the same emotion onstage.         She never wavered in her belief that movement could express inner feeling. Miss Graham sought to give "visible substance to things felt" and to "chart the graph of the heart." These celebrated Graham phrases became the metaphors central to her art.         Miss Graham's dances spoke elo- quently against the crushing of the human spirit, and one of her frequent themes was the condemnation of intolerance, especially toward nonconformists.         Her own life as a creative artist epitomized the independent spirit with which she so frequently imbued her dramatic heroines. The figure conquering sexual fear in "Errand Into the Maze," the woman looking deep into herself while preparing for an unnamed fate in "Herodiade" and the American pioneer brimming with optimism in "Frontier" could also be Clytemnestra or Jocasta, antiquity's queens who -- in the Graham canon -- emerged from crisis through the sheer force of self-understanding. Miss Graham usually cast herself at the center of these works until 1969, when she gave her last performance and retired reluctantly from the stage at the age of 75.         Because she rarely met conventional expectations about dance, she was both misunderstood and acclaimed. She was surrounded by debate throughout her career; few remained indifferent to her. Acknowledgment of Miss Graham's role as a dominant force in all the arts at first came from painters, writers, musicians and the acting profession. Gregory Peck and Bette Davis were among the many drama students she taught over the years at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Graham to perform at the White House in 1937, and in 1976 Miss Graham became the first dance personality to receive, from President Gerald R. Ford, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.         Nonetheless, Miss Graham's highly intense dancing and choreography were not intended to soothe the spirit and did not find ready acceptance. Quest for Inner Reality, But Never for Realism         Like Picasso, she was concerned with an inner reality. "For me, dance is theater," she wrote. But she never resorted to a realistic theater. More often than not, her choreography presented a dancer's body as distorted or dislocated, an assemblage of forms aligned into maximum expressiveness.         Audiences throughout the world were often disturbed by Miss Graham's frank acknowledgment of human sexuality, especially in her famous cycle inspired by Greek myths. Miss Graham's Medea, Jocasta, Phaedra and Clytemnestra gave vent to their lust and hate, baring the passions that few humans liked to recognize in themselves but that Miss Graham exposed with the unflinching scrutiny of a 20th-century Jungian analyst.         For Miss Graham, dance became a collective memory that could communicate the emotions universal to all civilizations: mythology, she felt, was the psychology of the ancients.         Miss Graham's encyclopedic approach to dance -- a creative wellspring from sources as varied as American Indian rituals to the Bible -- often carried several levels of meaning and startled a public that defined dance in linear or pictorial terms. Miss Graham, for her part, said she wanted her dances to be "felt" rather than comprehended in the usual manner.         In 1944, John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote of the emotional effect that the Graham dance theater could have upon the viewer. He warned that "Deaths and Entrances," the choreographer's study of turbulent passions inspired by Anne, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, the 19th-century English writers, was "un-understandable through the usual organs of understanding" and "slips in through sensory perceptions." The Graham Technique Is Based on Breathing         In general, Miss Graham saw art as a reflection of its time inseparable from life. "My dancing," she said, "is not an attempt to interpret life in the literary sense. It is an affirmation of life through movement."         Even the dance technique that she hammered out on her own body and then transferred to her school and company derived from the most organic aspect of human life: the act of breathing. That act was formalized and dramatized in the idiom's most basic principle, called contraction and release -- intensified moments of exhalation and inhalation. Miss Graham said her aim was "to increase the emotional activity of the dancer's body so that you are teaching the body, not teaching the mind."         The contraction, originating in the dancer's pelvis, created the percussive angular movement and sexual tension that invariably startled a newcomer to the Graham repertory. But it is the Graham idiom as a whole that can look strange to those who expect more of a continuum in dancing. Being 'the Thing Itself' Instead of Portraying It         Above all, she said, "Dance is not representational." Miss Graham recalled in later years that as a young dancer about to embark upon an independent career in 1922, she had chanced upon a nonfigurative painting by Wassily Kandinsky -- a slash of red against a field of blue. "I will dance like that," she said.         Like other modernists, Miss Graham rejected literal imagery in favor of abstraction. Form for form's sake, however, held no interest for her. Instead she focused on abstraction in its strict sense, that of extracting the essence of a quality of emotion. A celebrated example was "Lamentation," the 1930 solo in which Miss Graham, encased in a tube of stretch jersey, created sharply angular shapes on a bench. She did not dance about grief, but sought to be what she called "the thing itself" or the embodiment of grief.         Miss Graham's gift for the distilled image ranged over her entire career. In "Cave of the Heart" (1946), her Medea was the personification of hate, consumed by the venom of jealousy as visualized in snakelike contours.         The quintessential Graham could be found in "Frontier" (1935), one of the choreographer's pieces on overt American themes. The solo initiated her 32-year collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.         The set for "Frontier" was a fragment of a fence seemingly anchored by a rope behind. It had the same spareness and economy of Miss Graham's solo and the score of her music director and mentor of that time, Louis Horst. Noguchi noted in general that he had found in Miss Graham "a drive that motivated her to strip the dance to its stark rudiment." Noguchi's Sets Sought 'A Limitless Illusion'         Both artists shared an affinity for forms that looked abstract and were resonant with multiple meanings. Writing in 1984, Noguchi said that for "Frontier" he had "thought to catch the essential sculpture of space -- a limitless illusion." He continued: "This is the path I continued to investigate whenever Martha would call on me to rise to the occasion. She is the one who always came to me with her requirements and the myth she wished to encompass. My role was to respond."         Miss Graham's work revealed an integrated vision. She began using contemporary scores for the company she formed in 1929. After 1934, she tended to use commissioned music and was guided here by Horst, a composer who insisted that dance had a life independent of music and did not derive from it. Miss Graham herself, sometimes accused of using dance as mere aural decor, often said that she did not seek to interpret another art form -- that is, music.         Among the composers who wrote scores for Miss Graham were Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Aaron Copland, whose score for her 1944 classic, "Appalachian Spring," won the Pulitzer Prize.         Martha Graham, the eldest of three daughters, was born on May 11, 1894, in Allegheny, Pa., to George Graham, a physician who specialized in mental disorders, and the former Jane (Jenny) Beers, a descendant of Miles Standish. In 1908, the family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif. Started Dance Training At 22, After Father Died         In 1916, after the death of her father and after graduation from a junior college, the Cumnock School, Miss Graham enrolled in the Denishawn school in Los Angeles and then joined the Denishawn Company. Denishawn, organized by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, was then the only major dance company that worked outside the classical ballet tradition, and it became the incubating ground for such pioneering talents as Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Miss Graham herself.         John Murray Anderson saw Miss Graham with Denishawn and hired her for his Greenwich Village Follies in 1923 and 1924. But in those two years Miss Graham realized that neither Denishawn, with its exotic pretexts for dances, nor the commercial theater was right for her. At the invitation of Rouben Mamoulian, she joined the dance division of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she taught dance.         On April 18, 1926, she made her concert debut at the 48th Street Theater in New York with works that still showed the influence of Denishawn. "The idiom," the critic Robert Sabin recalled in 1953, "was still prevalently romantic and eclectic, but the spirit was new and as bracing as a salty sea wind."         Miss Graham taught in the early years in her studio at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 13th Street, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She assembled a company of women. Because the members had to support themselves, they would work on new works for nine months, then give a few recitals in New York and go on tour.         From her group, augmented by men in 1938 to 1939, came the next generation of modern dancers, choreographers and teachers: Anna Sokolow, Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, May O'Donnell, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham and later Paul Taylor and John Butler. Miss Graham, who had a long-term relationship with Horst, was married in 1948 to Mr. Hawkins. They separated in the early 1950's and were later divorced. Received Financial Help From Many Individuals         Before World War II, Miss Graham took on outside assignments. In 1930, she was the Chosen One in Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski and choreographed by Leonide Massine. A few years later she collaborated on dramatic productions with Blanche Yurka, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, and Archibald MacLeish.         Troubled by the recurring financial problems that were endemic to an art form struggling for acceptance, Miss Graham was helped over the years by individual patrons. Among them were Frances Steloff, founder of the Gotham Book Mart, whose $1,000 loan made the initial 1926 concert possible, Miss Cornell, Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace and, most recently, Halston. Mrs. Wallace made it possible for the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance to acquire the building at 316 East 63d Street, where the Graham school is situated.         In the early years, Miss Graham costumed herself and the women in her troupe in stretch jersey. She later referred to this time as her "long woolens" period. Her dances were spare and stark, testimony to her deep interest in ritual, and she was strongly influenced by the ceremonial Indian dances she had witnessed in the Southwest. These experiences were reflected in such works as "Primitive Mysteries" and "El Penitente," which remain in her company's repertory. From American Themes To Ancient Mythology         In the 1930's, Miss Graham was known for her American themes. "We must look to America to bring forth an art as powerful as America itself," she said, and produced such works as "American Document," "American Provincials," "Appalachian Spring," "Letter to the World" and "Salem Shore."         After 1946, she immersed herself in Hebrew and Greek mythology with "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey," "Errand Into the Maze," "Judith," "The Witch of Endor," "Phaedra" and, most powerfully, the full-evening "Clytemnestra" of 1958. She picked up historical personages with legendary qualities, the Bronte sisters for "Deaths and Entrances" and Joan of Arc for "Seraphic Dialogue."         As the years progressed, Miss Graham was loath to leave the stage. Since she was the central figure on that stage, she eventually began to create roles for herself that were less physically demanding. After her retirement from dancing, her new works rarely focused on a protagonist.         Repeatedly acclaimed as a choreographer, she always considered herself a dancer first. After relinquishing her roles to younger dancers, she continued to direct her company. She made triumphant tours to the Far East and Europe under Government auspices and, in her 80's and 90's, increasingly traveled abroad with her company. Her tour last fall took in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Congressional Propriety Offended by 'Phaedra'         It was on a European trip in 1962 that she ran afoul of two United States Representatives, Edna Kelly of Brooklyn and Peter Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. They saw "Phaedra" in Bonn and, apparently not knowing the Greek legend of a queen's passion for her stepson, protested that the work was too explicit to be a proper cultural export for the United States.         Although Miss Graham was identified with a new art form that initially rejected classical ballet as being inadequate for contemporary expression, she collaborated with ballet's leading personalities.         In 1959, the New York City Ballet presented "Episodes," consisting of two sections to Webern's music. George Balanchine choreographed one half and Miss Graham the other. In 1975, just before Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev appeared as guests in her company, she declared, "The war has ended," alluding to the perceived conflict between modern dance and ballet. Further proof came when Mikhail Baryshnikov appeared as a guest with her troupe from 1987 to 1989.         Among Miss Graham's awards were the first Guggenheim Fellowship given to a dancer; the Kennedy Center Honors; the Aspen Award in the Humanities; the Capezio Dance Award; the first Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award to honor achievement in modern dance; the Meadows Award in the performing arts; the Handel Medallion of New York City; the Henry Hadley medal for contribution to American music, and the first National Medal of Arts.         In 1987, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave Miss Graham the Ingenio et Arti medal, a rarely awarded honor and her country's highest distinction for contributions to the arts and sciences. Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, personally decorated her in 1984 with the Legion of Honor at the Paris Opera. She received a number of honorary degrees, from Yale, Harvard and other universities.         Miss Graham liked to emphasize that her work and private life were separate. "I have always fought against any dramatization of my peculiarities or my personality," she said. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Lask noted it was through her work "that she had, in William Faulkner's apt phrase, put a scratch on the face of eternity."         Martha Graham was living proof of her own adage: "No artist is ahead of his time. He         is         his time; it is just that others are behind the time."         Miss Graham leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Barbara Miller Baxter, a lawyer who specialized in estates and trusts, died on Tuesday at New York University Hospital. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Westbrook, Conn.         Mrs. Baxter died of cancer, her husband said.         At her death, Mrs. Baxter was with the Manhattan law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. She was a former president of the Estates, Trusts and Surrogate's Court Committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. She was also a delegate of the New York State Bar Association.         From 1982 to 1986 she was a New York State assistant attorney general specializing in trusts and estates. She had earlier been a law assistant to New York County Surrogate Millard L. Midonick.         Mrs. Baxter, who was born in New York, was an advertising executive in the 1950's and 1960's after graduating from Cornell University. She received a law degree from St. John's University in 1973.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph, a retired drug abuse counselor; a sister, Stephanie Urdang of Stamford, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Sherri, of Southbury, Conn., and Dana, of New Milford, Conn.; a stepson, Anthony, of Seattle, and a grandson.       
         Mary Lou Masey, a writer and researcher, died on April 16 after jumping from a hotel window in Philadelphia. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Masey suffered from manic depression, said her husband, Jack.         She was the author of four children's books published by David McKay. They were "Branislav the Dragon" (1967), "Story of the Steppes" (1968), "The Picture Story of the Soviet Union" (1971) and "Teddy and the Moon" (1972).         After living in the Soviet Union in the mid-60's, she became an editor and researcher at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Center in Washington. In 1984 Mrs. Masey moved to Manhattan, where she was a copy editor for the Macmillan Publishing Company, now Maxwell/ Macmillan, and later for Praeger Publishers.         Besides her husband, who is the president of Metaform Inc., a design concern, Mrs. Masey is survived by a sister, Virginia Olinger of Worthington, Ohio.       
         Lisa Taylor, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design from 1969 to 1987, died on Friday in a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas, said David McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts. She was 58 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mr. McFadden said she died of liver cancer.         The museum's current director, Dianne Pilgrim, said through a spokesman that Mrs. Taylor "had a passionate belief in the importance of design and brought that passion and excitement to the museum."         The museum, in the former Andrew Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st Street, is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It closed in 1963 but reopened in 1976, after Mrs. Taylor played a major role in raising funds to install it in the renovated mansion.         Grace Glueck, The New York Times critic, wrote in 1976, "The museum's far-reaching collection covers 3,000 years of artistic production, but it is also very much in touch with contemporary concerns, such as urban planning and the environment." 'Wallpaper to Bird Cages'         What is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum originated as a part of Cooper Union, which had housed it since 1897. In the 1960's, financial problems led Cooper Union to end its ties with the museum, which by then was what Paul Goldberger, The Times critic, called "one of the world's finest storehouses of objects of design and the decorative arts -- with everything from collections of wallpaper to bird cages."         In 1969, the secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, named her as head of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1972 the Carnegie Corporation donated the mansion, and over the next four years Mrs. Taylor and her staff managed to obtain more than $6 million from private individuals, corporations and foundations.         It was Mrs. Taylor who had the idea for the annual Museum Mile open house and street fair involving museums along upper Fifth Avenue. It was first held in 1979, and 10 museums participated last year.         In 1976, Mrs. Taylor said, "I think we'll be a great success, because we have a superb collection and people are becoming more and more aware of how design relates to the quality of life. And besides, there's a feeling of love for us because we've made it." Edited Design Series         Mr. McFadden said Mrs. Taylor retired in 1987 for reasons of health and to work on the final volumes in a series of books she edited. The series, titled "Immovable Objects," comprises six books of essays by various authorities on the impact of design on daily life. The volumes have separate topics ranging from urban open spaces to the subways.         Mrs. Taylor was born on Jan. 8, 1933, in New York, the daughter of Theo von Bergen-Maier, an architect, and the former Martina Weincerl, a painter.         She studied at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington and at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities.         She was on the staff of the President's Fine Arts Commission in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and membership director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington from 1962 to 1966. She then joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where she helped to devise a highly successful Smithsonian educational program before being named to head the Cooper Union Museum.         She was awarded honorary doctorates by the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.         She is survived by her second husband, Bertrand L. Taylor 3d, who is an investor; their daughter, Lauren, and their son, Lindsay, all of Naples, Fla.

         Coral Lansbury, an author, Victorian scholar and dean of the Graduate School of English at Rutgers University's Camden campus, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 61 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lansbury, who had written a number of scholarly literary works, began writing fiction late in her career when her cousin, the actress Angela Lansbury, said to her seven years ago, "Darling, are you going to go on all your life writing those dreary academic books that nobody reads?"         The result was "Sweet Alice," which E. P. Dutton brought out in 1986 and which Publishers Weekly praised as a "slightly naughty tale of greed, goodness and British breeding." Her second novel, "Ringarra," a Gothic tale, reached readers in 1985, even before "Sweet Alice" appeared. 'Mythic Quality' to Writing         In quick succession there followed "Felicity" (1987) a farce, and "The Grotto" (1989), whose writing was praised by John Mortimer in The New York Times Book Review for its "energy, good humor and mythic quality." Alfred A. Knopf will publish her fifth novel, "Opium!," next year.         Ms. Lansbury was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1929 to British parents who were touring in a production of the musical "Showboat." The family was stranded by the Great Depression and Ms. Lansbury graduated from North Sydney Girls High School, a selective institution, and entered the University of Sydney at age 15.         A year later her father, who had become a sound-effects man in the country's fledgling radio industry, got her a part in a drama on the air. She worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation into the 1960's but as television supplanted radio drama she turned more to academic interests, publishing articles and lecturing widely.         Ms. Lansbury came to the United States and joined the Rutgers faculty at Camden in 1974. She wrote four books on Anthony Trollope and other Victorian literary figures between 1975 and 1984. She served as president of the Victorian Studies Association and of the Victorian executive committee of the Modern Language Association.         She is survived by a son, Malcolm Turnbull of Sydney, and two grandchildren.

         Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.         For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.

         Eva Le Gallienne, who as an actress, producer, director, translator, writer and teacher was for many decades one of the grand figures of the American stage, died late Monday night at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 92 years old.         The cause of death was heart failure, said a friend, Anne Kaufman Schneider.         A commanding presence on the stage and a strong-minded director, Miss Le Gallienne was actually a slight and, according to her friends, a shy and private person, her affections being concentrated on her dogs and other pets. In a memoir, she expressed surprise at being called beautiful by critics; she said she thought beauty might be a burden.         She was dedicated to the theater from early childhood, two aunts and an uncle having been successful English actors. She was born in London on Jan. 11, 1899, the daughter of Richard Le Gallienne, a then-famous poet and journalist, and the former Julie Norregard, a Danish journalist. Her parents were divorced when Eva was 4 years old, and she and her mother moved to Paris. Saw Bernhardt Act         There, as a young girl, she saw Sarah Bernhardt act, and was taken backstage to meet the star. The experience was to determine the course of Miss Le Gallienne's own life.         "It made such an enormous impression on me that I thought, 'That's what I'd like to do,' " she said.         Eva was 15 when Constance Collier, a family friend, got her a walk-on role in Maeterlinck's "Monna Vanna" in London. She attended a drama school for a few months, but left for a part as a cockney servant girl in a minor comedy -- and brought down the house.         On the strength of rave reviews and encouragement from theater folk, Miss Le Gallienne and her mother left wartime London in 1915 for New York. Her bright expectations were not immediately realized. The first two plays in which she found work were failures, and she was dismissed from the cast of another play during its out-of-town tryouts. She spent a season on the road and in summer stock.  First Success         Finally, at the age of 20, she enjoyed her first big success, opposite Sidney Blackmer in Arthur Richman's "Not So Long Ago." This was followed by a still greater hit in 1921 with Joseph Schildkraut in the Theater Guild's production of Molnar's "Liliom."         In 1923, she had another hit in the star role in "The Swan" by Molnar. During its long run in 1923 and again in 1924-25, she became obsessed with the need for a repertory theater.         "Miss Le G.," as generations of theater people called her, came closer than any other person to endowing the United States with a permanent company performing repertory in the manner of the Old Vic, the Comedie Francaise and the Moscow Art Theater.         Without any government subsidy, she very nearly realized her dream. Willingly abandoning a career as a Broadway star in 1926, she founded the Civic Repertory Theater and staged classics at popular prices that filled the old 14th Street Theater for six seasons.         The Civic Rep's production of "Peter Pan," with the actress sailing to the balcony on an invisible wire, enchanted masses of children, and Josephine Hutchinson as "Alice in Wonderland" with Miss Le Gallienne as the White Queen enchanted grownups as well.         Among the company's apprentices were such hopeful novices as Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, J. Edward Bromberg and Howard Da Silva.         But although the Civic Repertory played in the main to full houses, the box office, with a top ticket price of $1.50, never quite met its budget. The company's wealthy patrons were hit by the Depression, donations dwindled and the theater closed in 1933. By then it had given 1,581 performances of 34 plays -- 32 of which Miss Le Gallienne had directed. She also acted in a majority of the plays.         At the end of the 1930-31 season, Miss Le Gallienne was severely burned in the explosion of a gasoline stove at her country home in Weston. The use of her hands was only partly restored in a series of operations, but she so mastered the handicap that few in her audiences perceived it.         After a series of operations on her crippled hands, she directed and starred on Broadway in Rostand's "L'Aiglon" with Ethel Barrymore.  'Rather Play Ibsen Than Eat'         After its long run, Miss Le Gallienne performed the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" in vaudeville, and translated, staged and acted in Ibsen's "Rosmersholm." It failed, using up her financial reserves. Long afterward, she wrote, "I would rather play Ibsen than eat -- and that's often just what it amounts to."         With her longtime companion, the late actress Marion Evensen, she moved to the estate at Weston, which she had bought at a prosperous time in 1926. There, with barnyard and forest creatures, cats and a kennel of cairn terriers, she busily gardened, wove, wrote and studied for the rest of her life -- but never abandoned the theater.         She lectured at colleges, toured frequently in plays and realized a youthful ambition by playing "Hamlet," in a summer production that she staged with the young Uta Hagen as Ophelia. For the Theater Guild, she directed a series of revivals at popular prices.         During the war years, the actress also toured for the Guild as Mrs. Malaprop in "The Rivals" and returned to Broadway as a star opposite Joseph Schildkraut in two successes: "Uncle Harry" by Thomas Job and a new "Cherry Orchard." She had also produced the play and helped to translate it.         With Margaret Webster and Cheryl Crawford, Miss Le Gallienne helped organize the American Repertory Theater in 1946, but the reviews were mixed, the costs were high and the three leaders did not always agree. The first season was the last.         In 1958, her television production of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey" was described by Jack Gould, the New York Times critic, as "unforgettable" and her part as "acting at its supreme best." Played Queen Elizabeth         Another memorable role was her performance as Queen Elizabeth in Schiller's "Mary Stuart," which she did on stage across the country periodically from 1957 through 1962, and also on television.         As translator, director and a star of Chekhov's "Seagull" in 1964, Miss Le Gallienne received from Adlai E. Stevenson the award of the American National Theater and Academy. She got another ANTA award on her 78th birthday in 1977.         She was then on tour, in "The Royal Family." The revival of the Edna Ferber-George S. Kaufman comedy based on the Barrymore family was a hit of the 1976 Broadway season and a triumph for Miss Le Gallienne, who played the mother of the tribe, skipping girlishly upstairs in Act I and descending like an elderly queen in Act III.         As a result of her work in "The Royal Family," she received New York City's cultural award, the Handel Medallion, and the observation by the actress Rosemary Harris:         "If you listen to Miss Le G., you can hear 15 shades of meaning in 15 syllables."         In 1981 Miss Le Gallienne returned to Broadway in "To Grandmother's House We Go," which ran for only 61 performances. Returned as White Queen         But her enthusiasm for her next Broadway project was boundless, since it involved her co-directing a late 1982 revival of her beloved "Alice in Wonderland" and again assuming the role of the White Queen. It, too, however, was a flop, closing after 21 regular performances.         In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Arts.         Miss Le Gallienne traveled everywhere for many years with a two-pound Yorkshire terrier, Nana, in a little basket.         After observing two barnyard hens, she wrote a children's book, "Flossie and Bossie: A Moral Tale." She also translated "Seven Tales by Hans Christian Andersen" and wrote a bio graphy, "The Mystic in the Theater: Eleonora Duse" (1966).         Stagestruck to the end, she once recalled a young woman complaining that she had never seen Sarah Bernhardt, Sacha Guitry, Isadora Duncan or Duse. "I thought to myself," Miss Le Gallienne said, " 'I wouldn't change places with you for anything; not even to be 20 again!' "         There are no survivors.       
         Agnes Waldron, a research assistant to Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, died Wednesday at the Washington Hospice Center. She was 66 years old and lived in Washington.         Miss Waldron died of breast cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         In 1957 she joined the staff of Vice President Nixon. She previously worked in child welfare, family assistance and disaster relief.         In the 1960's she worked for the Stanford Research Institute, the American Enterprise Institute and the House Republican Conference.         In 1968 she went back to work for Mr. Nixon, to direct research activities for his Presidential campaign. In the Nixon Administration she was director of the research office at the White House.         As special assistant to President Ford she edited the daily news summary, prepared the Presidential briefing books and managed research projects.         In 1976, Miss Waldron became research director at the Senate Republican Policy Committee and in 1980 was named senior policy analyst for the Reagan campaign. In 1984 she was appointed director of research for the 1984 Republican platform.         She was called back to the White House by President Reagan in 1985 and was named special assistant to the President in the office of communications, where she remained until the end of his second term.         She was a consultant before retiring in 1990.         Miss Waldron was born in New Canaan, Conn. She graduated from the University of Connecticut and received a master's degree in social work from Catholic University.         She is survived by a sister, Anna Filmer, of Albuquerque, N.M.       
         Margaret L. Suckley, an aide and confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and an archivist at the nation's first Presidential Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., died on Saturday at Wilderstein, her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 99 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Miss Suckley, who was known as Daisy, was a distant cousin and close neighbor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and lived her entire life in the landmark house overlooking the Hudson River near Hyde Park built by her grandfather in 1852.         In 1940, Miss Suckley, who raised Scottish terriers, gave the President a puppy he named Fala. The dog soon became the country's most photographed animal. Miss Suckley was the co-author of a children's book about Fala and took part in producing two short films depicting the dog's life in the limelight. Center of Political Uproar         Fala became the center of a political uproar in the 1944 Presidential campaign, when Republicans charged that the Navy had sent a warship to rescue the dog after he had been left behind during a visit by President Roosevelt to the Aleutian Islands. The President turned the story to his advantage by expressing mock indignation that his Republican adversaries would attack "even my little dog Fala."         Miss Suckley was largely invisible to the general public although she traveled with the President on wartime inspection trips and to meetings with heads of state and allied military leaders. She was at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga., when President Roosevelt suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945.         She continued on the staff of the Roosevelt Library until she retired in 1963. She often spoke about the Roosevelt Presidency from her privileged station close to the family but was unassuming and meticulously factual and circumspect in her recollections. Nurse's Aide During War         Miss Suckley was born at Wilderstein and was a descendant of several prominent American families of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Livingstons and Beekmans. She attended Bryn Mawr and during World War I served as a nurse's aide at a military hospital on Ellis Island.         In 1980, she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation, dedicated to the maintenance and public enjoyment of her 45-acre riverfront property whose grounds were designed by Calvert Vaux, the noted 19th century park architect, and whose Queen Anne interiors were the work of J. B. Tiffany. Last year Wilderstein received National Historic Landmark status.         Miss Suckley, the last of seven brothers and sisters, is survived by two nieces, Margaret Hendrick of Annapolis, Md., and Catherine Hambley of Rhinebeck.

         Dr. Frances Arkin, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who practiced in New York for many years before moving to Miami in 1978, died on July 3 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 87 years old.         She died of a stroke, said her sister, Evelynne Abrams of Middletown, N.Y.         Dr. Arkin, a native of Boston and a graduate of Tufts Medical School, was a founder in 1944 of the first psychoanalytic training program at the New York Medical College, where she was a faculty member for 24 years. Earlier she had served with the New York City Bureau of Child Guidance and had maintained a private practice here.         She was a past president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. For 17 years before she retired in 1986, Dr. Arkin was a consultant in training of psychiatric residents at the Miami Veterans Hospital.         Her longtime companion was Janine Rolland of Miami. Mrs. Abrams is her only family survivor.       
         Katherine Byrne Mast, one of the first female sugar brokers in New York City, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Devon, Pa. She was 84 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mrs. Mast died of Parkinson's disease, said her nephew, John Ferguson of Greenwich, Conn.         During the early 1930's, she worked in the Manhattan office of W. H. Edgar and Son, sugar brokers of Detroit. She remained with the company until her marriage some 20 years later.         After her husband's death in 1964, she took over his business, Dutton, Mast & Company, a textile concern in Manhattan. The company was later sold.         From 1969 to 1986, when she retired, Mrs. Mast was president of Aug Millang, realtors in Manhasset, L.I.         She was a gradute of All Saints Academy in Harlem and of Trinity College in Washington.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Carol Laise, an American Ambassador who was the wife of an American Ambassador and the first woman to be an Assistant Secretary of State, died yesterday at her home in Dummerston, Vt. She was 73 years old.         Miss Laise died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She was named Ambassador to Nepal by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 and remained in the post until 1973. In January 1974 she married Ambassador at Large Ellsworth Bunker, a 79-year-old widower, in Katmandu, Nepal. She kept her maiden name professionally.         It was the first marriage between two American Ambassadors. Miss Laise was a close friend of Mr. Bunker's first wife, Harriet Allen Bunker, who died in 1964, and it was Miss Laise's first marriage.         For nearly six years after their marriage the couple saw each other only once a month when Ambassador Laise would take a plane provided by President Johnson and fly to Saigon, where Ambassador Bunker was trying to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam. Named Director General         In October 1973 she returned to Washington and was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Bureau of Public Affairs, the first woman to hold so high a post in the department. Before her appointment as Ambassador to Nepal she had been director of the Office of South Asian Affairs,         In 1974 Miss Laise became director general of the Foreign Service, the highest nonpolitical job in the Foreign Service, a post she held until she retired in 1977.         Caroline Clendening Laise began her Government career in 1940 as an occupational coder for the Civil Service Commission. In 1946 she went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1948 joined the State Department.         From 1956 to 1961 she was an adviser to American delegates to various United Nations agencies and in 1962 was made deputy director of the Office of South Asian Affairs with responsibilty for diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India and Pakistan.         In comparing the economic problems of Nepal with those of India, she said in a 1966 interview with Ann Terry Pincus of The New York Post, "You could explain that Nepal is like Appalachia, and India has the problems of Harlem." An Adviser in New Delhi         When Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey went to India and Pakistan in 1965, Miss Laise went along as his adviser. In the 1962-63 Chinese invasion of India, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith sent for Miss Laise for advice and she spent about a year in New Delhi.         She was a winner in 1965 of the annual Federal Women's Award for outstanding contributions by women in government service, and in 1973 she received the Career Service Award of the National Civil Service League.         Miss Laise, a native of Winchester, Va., was a graduate of American University and received an M.A. in political science from George Washington University.         Her husband, Ambassador Bunker, died in 1984.         She is survived by a brother, Frederick Laise of Santa Fe, N.M.; two stepsons, Samuel Bunker of Dummerston, Vt., and John Bunker of Wheatland, Wy.; and a stepdaughter, Ellen Bunker of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Florence Cohen, president emeritus of the Volunteers for Israel, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Cohen died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She had been active with the Volunteers of Israel since its founding in 1982. The organization sends volunteers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America to Israel to work in a civilian capacity on military bases and in kibbutzes. It is an offshoot of an 1982 volunteer drive that was established to alleviate shortages created by the war in Lebanon.         Mrs. Cohen, a native of Ramsey, N.J., was a registered nurse who got her nursing degree in 1943. She left nursing to raise a family but returned to the profession in the early 1970's, most recently working at the now defunct Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jules Cohen, a New York cardiologist; two sons, David, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Linda, of Boston, and three grandchildren.       
         Sister Elizabeth Cavanagh, a former vice president and dean of students at Manhattanvlle College in Purchase, N.Y., died on Sunday at Kenwood Convent of the Sacred Heart in Albany. She was 77 years old.         She died of bone cancer, Sister Mary Lyman said.         Before her death, Sister Cavanagh was director of pastoral care at San Jose Hospital in San Jose, Calif.         She served as an administrator at Manhattanville from 1953 to 1968. Earlier, she was dean at Newton College in Newton, Mass. She entered the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1935 and began her career in education in 1938 as a teacher at Maplehurst Academy in the Bronx.       
         Elizabeth Vera Loeb Stern, professor emerita of English at Hunter College, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Mrs. Stern died of natural causes, a spokesperson for the family said.         Mrs. Stern began her professional association with Hunter in 1915 as a temporary instructor of English, speech and dramatics. During her tenure she established the first Hunter Theater and Concert Bureau and the first credit courses in dramatics, including the master's program in speech and dramatics. She retired as an associate professor in 1963.         She was past president of the Hunter Faculty Club, the Hunter Chapter of the American Association of University Professors and of the Hunter Unit of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. She instituted the speakers bureau of the Manhattan League of Women Voters and, in 1973, was a volunteer administrator for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.         In 1973 she was given an award from Hunter for distinguished service to the Alumni Association and to the college.         She graduated from Hunter College in 1915 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1948.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marguerite Feinstein, founder and director of the retiree division of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 23,000 municipal workers in New York City, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 57 years old and lived in Clinton Corners, N.Y.         Mrs. Feinstein, who was known as Maggie, was the wife of Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said Frank Mazza, a spokesman for the union.         Under the Local 237 retiree program, which Mrs. Feinstein founded in 1980, more than 5,000 members participate in classes, community projects and political activities as well as the customary social activities, trips and health-care seminars offered by labor unions. The program has become a model for teamster locals across the country and for locals of other unions.         Mrs. Feinstein was born in Milton, N.Y., and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Marist College. Before joining Local 237, she was director of legislation and political education for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in New York State.         Mrs. Feinstein's older son by a previous marriage, John Dakin, who lived in Poughkeepsie, died of a heart attack on July 23. In addition to Mr. Feinstein, she is survived by her younger son, Patrick Dakin of Poughkeepsie; a daughter, Colleen Trogisch of Pleasant Valley, N.Y.; and two granddaughters.       
         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.         Dr. Weaver is believed to have been the first black woman to earn a doctorate in her field, speech correction, audiology and linguistics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Northwestern.         Dr. Weaver graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1932. She taught in speech departments at Roosevelt College in Chicago and Howard University in Washington, as well as Brooklyn College.         In 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson named her husband Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making him the first black Cabinet member in the nation's history. At first, Dr. Weaver remained at Brooklyn College and the Weavers had a commuter marriage. But, Mr. Weaver said yesterday, it was not satisfactory and she retired in 1967 to join him in Washington.         While there, she served as a consultant to the Women's Job Corps, the National Advisory Research Council of the Institute of Dental Research and the Children's Hearing and Speech Center, an affiliate of Children's Hospital.         Besides her husband, Dr. Weaver is survived by a brother, Hampton D. Haith of Winston-Salem, N.C.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Brandee Erlanger, a volunteer and fund-raiser for the United Nations for more than 30 years, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a stroke, her husband, Jack, said.         Mrs. Erlanger, a native New Yorker, first became active at the United Nations in Volunteer Services, now known as Staff Activities. She was an officer and past president of the United Nations Hospitality Committee and often headed its fund-raising galas.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Erlanger is survived by a daughter, Peri, of Manhattan; two sisters, Lillian Picoult of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Rose Finkelstein of Ellenville, N.Y., and four brothers, Ruby Mayer of Lakewood, N.J., Harvey and Murray, both of Fort Lauderdale, and Leonard, of Hauppauge, L.I.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses, whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died Thursday night at her home in South Salem, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill.

She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice.         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two sons, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Ms. Dewhurst's first major Broadway role came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero.         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Among her many screen credits was the recent movie "Dying Young," with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!"         Her television appearances included three seasons playing Candice Bergen's mother on "Murphy Brown," for which she won an Emmy Award in 1989. She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship, because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to her sons, she is survived by two grandchildren. No public service is planned.

         Bena Frank Mayer, a painter best known for her portraits, died on Thursday at the St. Luke's division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her lawyer, Martin Bressler, said.         Mrs. Mayer exhibited in many group shows with the National Association of Women Artists, winning several of its awards, and was a past president of the New York Society of Women Artists.         She was the widow of Ralph Mayer, also a painter and an expert in the field of artists' materials and techniques, who died in 1979. Twenty years earlier, with the support of the A.&P. heir Huntington Hartford, the couple had founded the nonprofit Artists Technical Research Institute, whose aim was to establish reliable scientific data on artists' materials. Mrs. Mayer also helped her husband research and edit several reference books he wrote for artists, including "The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques," first published in 1940 and now considered a classic in the field.         In 1990 she was instrumental in establishing the Ralph Mayer Learning Center, successor to the Artists Technical Research Institute, at the Yale University School of Art. The center supports research and writing on the use of materials and the study of artists' techniques. A show of Mrs. Mayer's landscapes and portraits was held at Yale in connection with the opening of the institute in September 1990.         Mrs. Mayer was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1898, spent her early years in Wyoming, and came to New York in 1914. She studied at the Cooper Union and the Arts Students League, and also privately with the painter Stuart Davis. She married Mr. Mayer in 1927.         There are no immediate survivors. A funeral service is to be held today at 9:30 A.M. at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.       
         Eva Bertrand Adams, a gold miner's daughter who presided over the United States Mint for eight years, died Friday at a hospital in Reno. Miss Adams was 80 years old and lived in Reno.         The funeral home said she died of natural causes.         Miss Adams was born in Wonder, Nev., a gold-mining town that died when the gold ran out. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada and a master's degree in English from Columbia University.         She taught high school English in Las Vegas before returning to the University of Nevada as an instructor in 1936. She also served as assistant dean of women at the university before beginning a new career in 1940 as the principal aide to Senator Pat McCarran, Republican of Nevada, in Washington.         She continued as administrative assistant to Mr. McCarran until he died in 1954, then served under his interim successor and under Senator Alan Bible, a Democrat elected as Mr. McCarran's permanent replacement.         While working for Senator McCarran, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she received an bachelor of laws degree from George Washington University in 1948 and a doctor of laws degree from the university two years later. She became a member of the bar in her home state and in the District of Columbia, as well as of the Supreme Court bar.         In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named her director of the Mint.         During her tenure, Miss Adams authorized and supervised the construction of a new mint in Philadelphia and the expansion of the Denver Mint. She also battled an acute nationwide coin shortage in the early 1960's that was caused by hoarding and a proliferation of coin-operated vending machines.         President Lyndon B. Johnson reappointed her in 1966 and she retired from the post in September 1969 for yet another career, as a management consultant in Reno.         Miss Adams left no immediate survivors.       
         Ruth G. Schapiro, a nationally known tax lawyer and a partner in the New York firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Donald Schapiro, her husband of 39 years, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Schapiro, a native of Manhattan, was a 1947 graduate of Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where she was notes editor of the Law Review. She went to work in 1951 at the firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and joined the Proskauer firm in 1955.         President Carter appointed Mrs. Schapiro to the Tax Court Nominating Commission in 1978, and she served as a member of the panel until 1981. At the time of her death, she was chairwoman of the committee on personal income taxes of the New York City State Bar Association.         She was a past chairwoman of the state bar's tax section, as well as of its finance committee, and served on the executive committee of the state bar's House of Delegates. From 1984 to 1989, she also headed a special committee on women in the courts set up by the state bar.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Schapiro's survivors include a daughter, Jane G., also of Manhattan; a son, Robert A., of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of United States District Court in Manhattan.       
         Rita Greenland, an advertising executive active in Jewish organizations, died on Saturday at New York University Hospital. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan and Bedford Hills, N.Y.         The family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Greenland, a graduate of Brooklyn College, was the senior vice president for human relations at Smith/Greenland Advertising Inc. in New York. Her associations included the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Cancer Society and the Library Volunteers of the Scarsdale P.T.A.         Mrs. Greenland is survived by her husband, Leo; two sons, Seth and Andrew; a sister, Yvette Rosenzweig, and a granddaughter, all of New York City.       
         Catherine M. Prelinger, a Yale lecturer, author and historian, died on Saturday at the Yale Health Plan Care Center in New Haven. She was 66 years old and lived in Killingsworth, Conn.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Prelinger was an associate editor of Yale's Papers of Benjamin Franklin project, which she joined in 1970. She also was a member of the advisory committee on women's programs at the Harvard Divinity School.         Long a prominent figure in the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, Mrs. Prelinger served as its president from 1975 to 1977 and last year was a member of its nominating committee.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Prelinger was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar College who earned her Ph.D. in history at Yale University in 1954.         She also contributed to scholarly journals both in this country and in Germany and had just completed the editing of a book, "Episcopal Woman," to be published next year by the Oxford University Press in New York.         Mrs. Prelinger is survived by her husband, Dr. Ernst Prelinger, a Yale University psychologist; two daughters, Dr. Katherine Holden of Sharon, Conn., and Edith Holden Roth of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; a stepson, Richard Prelinger of New York City; three stepdaughters, Elizabeth A. Prelinger of Washington, Polly Prelinger of San Francisco, and Jane Rothkopf of New York City; and six grandchildren.       
         Carolyn Elsinger, executive vice president of CKDC Steel Inc., died on Tuesday in New York. She was 46 years old and had homes on Shelter Island, L.I., and in Avon-by-the-Sea, N.J.         She died of pancreatic cancer, family members said.         She was with CKDC Steel, a Manhattan company that trades in carbon wire and wire rod, from 1981 until she became ill earlier this year. Before that she was an executive assistant to the chairman of Genimar Inc., manufacturers of fabricated masonry wall reinforcements, also in New York.         Her companion was Frank Hopler of Cliffside Park, N.J.         She is survived by a son, Brett Smith of Miami; two brothers, Bernard, of Leonia, N.J., and Drew, of Miami; a sister, Marjorie Smith of Miami, and a niece and two nephews.       
         Belinda Mason, a member of the National Commission on AIDS who pleaded with President Bush in a letter in August not to support proposed Federal policies that she said would further stigmatize AIDS sufferers, died this morning at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. She was 33 years old.         She died of AIDS-related pneumonia, a spokesman for the commission said.         Ms. Mason was infected with the virus that causes AIDS when she received a blood transfusion in 1987 while giving birth to her second child. Hospital workers had not tested the blood she received, but later found that it was contaminated with the AIDS virus.         Before she became infected, Ms. Mason worked as a reporter for two weekly newspapers, The Ohio County Times-News in Hartford, Ky., and later for The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky. She also wrote short stories.         When she learned she was infected with AIDS, she became an advocate for better medical and social treatment of people with the AIDS virus. Ms. Mason founded Kentuckiana People With AIDS Coalition, the first Kentucky-based advocacy organization for those stricken with AIDS. 'An AIDS Poster Child'         She later became president of the National Association of People With AIDS and was appointed by President Bush to the National Commission on AIDS in 1990.         "I have become the disease," she said in an interview six weeks ago. "When people talk to me now, they see the disease first. Nobody talks to Belinda Mason the short-story writer anymore. My previous identity has dissolved. I've become an AIDS poster child."         In her letter to Mr. Bush on Aug. 2 she said she had no ill will toward health-care workers even though she contracted the disease through their lapses. She also said she opposed widespread compulsory testing of such workers. Nor, she wrote, did she want people with AIDS to be barred from entering the United States. Both proposals are being considered in Washington.         "Mr. President, doctors don't give people AIDS -- they care for people with it," she wrote. "The blanket screening of health-care workers will create the false illusion that people with AIDS are a threat to others."         Ms. Mason is survived by her husband, Stephen Carden, and their two children, Polly, 8, and Clayton, 4. She will be buried on their Kentucky farm.       
         Ann C. Whitman, an influential figure in the White House as the personal secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Tuesday at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Clearwater.         Mrs. Whitman died of heart failure, friends said.         "There's no question she played a vital role in the Eisenhower Administration; he really depended on her tremendously," said Robert J. Donovan, author of "Confidential Secretary: Ann Whitman's 20 Years with Eisenhower and Rockefeller" (E. P. Dutton, 1988).         Mrs. Whitman routinely worked 12 hours a day, and often seven days a week. Among her chores was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, which reached hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Recruited in 1952         Mrs. Whitman, whose maiden name was Cook, was born in Perry, Ohio, and attended Antioch College. As part of its work-study program, she went to the Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, became a secretary there and never returned to college. Her next job, which she held for 16 years, was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father was a founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company.         In the early 1950's Mrs. Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe. She was then recruited for the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952, and worked for Eisenhower through both of his Administrations.         In 1961 she worked for George Hinman, a political adviser to Rockefeller when he was Governor of New York, and became the Governor's executive assistant in 1965. In 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford named Rockefeller as Vice President, she served as his chief of staff. She retired in 1977.         Mrs. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1940 she married Edmund Whitman, her first husband's business colleague at the United Fruit Company. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1961.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Veronica Perry, a Harlem teacher and the mother of Edmund Perry, the honor student fatally shot by a police officer on Morningside Drive on June 12, 1985, died on Oct. 4 at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 44 years old.         She died as a result of a heart condition, the funeral home said.         Mrs. Perry, a fifth-generation Harlem resident and a graduate of Bronx Community College and Fordham University, was a teacher for the Lenox Hill Association. She was a past president of Community School Board 3 and of the Parent-Teacher Association of Wadleigh Junior High School and was a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club.         She is survived by her husband, Jonah Perry Sr.; her mother, Eva Rutledge; a son, Jonah Jr.; a daughter, Nicol, and several brothers and sisters.       
         Alice R. Bachrach, a volunteer leader of numerous national social service agencies who was involved in a landmark discrimination suit, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bachrach died of cancer, her family said.         Among her early activities, she organized and was chairwoman of the Women's Division of the National Jewish Welfare Board and was a vice president of the board for 19 years. She was a board member of the United Service Organizations during World War II and the Korean war.         She also had been an honorary governor of Hebrew Union College, vice president of the New York City Y.W.H.A., vice president of the national Girl Scouts and chairwoman of its American Girl magazine, executive committee member of the New York Blood Center and a trustee of the Parsons School of Design.         Mrs. Bachrach, whose maiden name was Rothschild, was born and grew up in Manhattan and studied at Parsons. She married Alfred R. Bachrach, a prominent accounting executive and president of Temple Emanu-El, the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. Mr. Bachrach has since died.         In a landmark case 30 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach filed a religious-discrimination complaint against a Park Avenue cooperative for rejecting their application to buy an apartment. The city Human Rights Commission upheld their complaint and moved for injunctive relief, the first time the agency exercised that remedy against a cooperative.         Mrs. Bachrach is survived by her twin sons, John, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Robert, of Manhattan and Southbury, Conn., and a daughter, Ellin Gordon, of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Mary Vandergrift, a founder and longtime executive of Parke-Bernet Galleries auction house and for many years a major figure in international auctions, died in her sleep on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         Her daughter, Joan Sweeney of Manhattan, said the cause of death was heart failure.         Ms. Vandergrift was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 4, 1901, and attended college there. Pursuing an interest in art and antiques, she worked for American Art Galleries, later known as American Art Anderson Galleries, a well-known auction house in New York. In 1937, she left American Art with a group of employees that included Hiram H. Parke, Otto Bernet, Leslie A. Hyam and Lewis Marion. Together they formed Parke-Bernet Galleries, which came to dominate New York City's art and antiques auction scene.         Throughout her assocation with the house, Miss Vandergrift oversaw press relations and the design and production of catalogues. When Parke-Bernet was acquired by Sotheby & Company, an English auction house, in 1963, she was named executive vice president of the new firm, Sotheby Parke Bernet. When she retired in 1971, she was succeeded by John Marion, who is now chairman of the firm, which changed its name to Sotheby's Inc. in 1985.         Miss Vandergrift was on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development. Her first husband, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Sr., a career officer in the Army, died in the early 1950's; in 1968 she married E. Swift Newton, an Irish businessman, who died in 1974.         She is survived by her daughter; a sister, Katherine, of Manhattan; her step-son, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Jr., of Orlando, Fla., and three granddaughters.

         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World."

She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

         Lydia Ulana Savoyka, a Ukrainian-born social worker, who served 35 years as director of immigration counseling services for the United States Catholic Conference, died on Dec. 20 at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after collapsing in her office, her sister, Vera Savoyka, said.         Ms. Savoyka, whose father was arrested and killed by Russian forces in Cracow, Poland, came to the United States in 1948, under a program for orphans, sponsored by the National Catholic Welfare Conference. As soon as she graduated from high school, Ms. Savoyka began working with immigrants on Ellis Island under the auspices of the Welfare Conference, now known as the U.S. Catholic Conference.         Fluent in 11 languages, she proved invaluable in dealing with the wave of post-World War II immigrants from Eastern Europe and the later influx of refugees from Central America. While carrying a heavy work load, she earned a degree in sociology by going to night school at Hunter College. 'Extraordinary Devotion'         Besides her counseling activities, Ms. Savoyka was president of the New York General Committee for Immigration, grouping 30 private agencies, and was a member of the National Advisory Council on Immigration and Naturalization. She was also vice president of the Ukrainian Institute of America and president of the Self-Reliance Senior Citizens Club.         In conferring on her an honorary doctorate in law in 1982, the College of New Rochelle cited her "life of extraordinary devotion to America's newest arrivals." In the last few years she had personally helped hundreds of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear diaster of April 1986, arranging medical and immigration services.         She is survived by her sister.

         Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.         Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
