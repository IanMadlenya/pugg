         Charity Adams Earley, the commander of the only all-black Women's Army Corps unit to serve overseas during World War II, died on Jan. 13 in Dayton, Ohio, long her hometown. She was 83.         At a time when a segregated military provided few opportunities for blacks, Charity Adams was one of only two to hold a wartime rank in the Wacs as high as major. A subsequent promotion made her a lieutenant colonel briefly before she left military service in 1946.         The Army first permitted black members of the Wacs to serve overseas in the winter of 1945, when it created the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-black unit,  and assigned some 850 African-American women to it. The unit, based in Birmingham, England, and later in Rouen, France, and Paris,  routed mail -- much of it backed up at English warehouses in the chaos that followed the Battle of the Bulge -- to millions of members of the armed forces in Europe.         The assignment of Major Adams as the battalion commander seemed a natural choice. Having grown up in Columbia, S.C. -- her father a minister in the A.M.E. Church, her mother  a teacher -- she had graduated from Wilberforce University in Ohio and was studying for a master's degree at Ohio State when she joined the  Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, the forerunner of the Wacs, in 1942. She was among 39 black women in the corps's first training class, at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and became one of its first black officers. She then held administrative and command positions at Fort Des Moines for two and a half years.         From her first day in the corps, though, she had to bear the humiliations of a segregated military. Though she had forged a quick camaraderie with white officer candidates who had ridden with her by train to Fort Des Moines, the bond did not survive once they reached their destination.         ''The Army soon shattered whatever closeness we had felt,'' she recalled in her memoir, ''One Woman's Army'' (Texas A&M Press, 1989). ''When we left the mess hall we were marched two-by-two's to the reception center. A young, red-haired second lieutenant said, 'Will all the colored girls move over on this side.' He pointed to an isolated group of seats.         ''There was a moment of stunned silence, for even in the United States of the 40's it did not occur to us that this could happen. The integration of our trip did not prepare us for this. What made things worse was that even after the 'colored girls' had been pushed to the side, all the rest of the women were called by name to join a group to be led to their quarters. Why could not the 'colored girls' be called by name to go to their quarters rather than be isolated by race?''         The members of the 6888th postal unit were the first black women many Britons in Birmingham had ever seen, and they shattered stereotypes.         ''These Wacs are very different from the colored women portrayed on the films, where they are usually either domestics or the outspoken old-retainer type or sloe-eyed sirens given to gaudiness of costume and eccentricity in dress,'' The Birmingham Sunday Mercury said. ''The  Wacs have dignity and proper reserve.''         That dignity was tested by both the Army and the Red Cross.         Major Adams recalled in her memoir that when a general inspecting her battalion was told that not all the women would be present, since some were working and others sleeping after a night shift, he responded, ''I'm going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit.''         Major Adams replied, ''Over my dead body, sir.''         The general threatened to court-martial Major Adams for that remark, and she, in turn, prepared to file charges against him for disobeying a directive from Allied headquarters to refrain from language stressing racial segregation. The matter was dropped by both sides, and the general later told Major Adams he had come to respect her.         While in England, Major Adams refused equipment from the Red Cross for a segregated recreational center -- the battalion had been permitted use of the same recreational area used by whites -- and persuaded members of the unit not to stay at a segregated Red Cross hotel in London while on leave.         After her military service, she received a master's degree in vocational psychology from Ohio State, then became a dean at Tennessee A&I  College and Georgia State College. The Smithsonian Institution has included her in its listing of the historically most important black women.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Stanley Earley Jr., a physician whom she wed after the war; a son,  Stanley III; a daughter, Judith Earley; two brothers, Senior Bishop John Adams of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and E. Avery Adams; and a sister, Dr. Lucy Rose Adams.         In 1996, Mrs. Earley was honored at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum for her wartime service.  Before leaving Dayton for the ceremony in Washington, she said: ''When I talk to students, they say, 'How did it feel to know you were making history?' But you don't know you're making history when it's happening. I just wanted to do my job.''       
         Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish writer whose rollicking, anarchic books about Pippi Longstocking rattled some tradition-bound Swedes when they first appeared almost 60 years ago but came to captivate millions of children around the world, died yesterday at her home in Stockholm. She was 94.         Mrs. Lindgren, who began publishing in the 1940's, became one of the world's most widely translated authors. In addition to being a beloved cultural figure in Sweden, she was also a powerful political force, successfully lobbying on issues like tax reform and improved conditions for farm animals.         Although Mrs. Lindgren produced more than 70 books for young people, she was best known as the author of the classic ''Pippi Longstocking,'' first published in Sweden in 1945 and in the United States five years later. The title character is a 9-year-old carrot-haired enfant terrible who lives cheerfully by herself in the ramshackle Villa Villekulla and befriends her better behaved, better groomed neighbors, Tommy and Annika.         ''She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy,'' the book begins.         ''Pippi'' and its sequels have together sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. The sheer subversive quality of the books, whose brazen young heroine does exactly as she pleases, made them unusual for juvenile literature.         ''Bertrand Russell has written that a child dreams about power as grown-ups dream sexual wish dreams,'' Mrs. Lindgren said in a 1985 interview. ''This is a child who has power. That is wonderful, for children to think, 'Oh, if I were like Pippi! I could say to Father, '' 'You don't do that!' ''         ''She has power, but she never misuses that power,'' Ms. Lindgren said, ''which I think is the most splendid thing, and the most difficult.''         Mrs. Lindgren was born Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson on Nov. 14, 1907, the second of four children of Samuel August and Hanna Jonsson Ericsson, in Vimmerby, in southern Sweden. Her father was a tenant farmer, and Mrs. Lindgren grew up outside Vimmerby at Nas, a 500-year-old farm, in an old red house surrounded by apple orchards.         ''Rocks and trees were as close to us as living beings, and nature protected and nurtured our playing and our dreaming,'' she wrote in a 1973 memoir. ''Whatever our imagination could call forth was enacted in the land around us -- all fairy tales, all adventures we invented or read about or heard about, all of it happened there, and only there. Even our songs and prayers had their places in surrounding nature.''         The pastoral idyll of Mrs. Lindgren's youth came to an end in 1926, when, 19 and unmarried, she became pregnant. She fled to Copenhagen, where she gave birth to a son, Lars, and later settled in Stockholm.         To support herself, she took a secretarial job at the Royal Automobile Club in Stockholm. (Among Mrs. Lindgren's lesser known writing is the 1939 work ''Twenty-Five Automobile Tours in Sweden.'') In 1931 she married a co-worker, Sture Lindgren. Mrs. Lindgren, who was widowed in 1952, is survived by a sister, Stina Hergin; her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         It was Karin who first conjured up Pippi. In 1941 when she was 7 she was sick in bed with pneumonia. Night after night she nagged her mother to tell her a story.         ''What should I tell?'' the exhausted Mrs. Lindgren asked one evening.         ''Tell about Pippi Langstrump'' -- Pippi Longstocking -- Karin replied, coining the name on the spot.         Her mother gamely complied.         ''I didn't ask her who Pippi Longstocking was,'' Mrs. Lindgren told The New Yorker in 1983. ''I just began the story, and since it was a strange name it turned out to be a strange girl as well.''         Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's daughter Longstocking was indeed a strange girl. Her fiery hair stuck straight out from either side of her head in two tight braids. She wore one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. Her mother was long dead; her sailor father had been lost at sea, though Pippi was confident he had come ashore on a South Sea island where ''he had become king of all the cannibals.'' She had a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nilsson for company and a trunkful of gold pieces to provide for her wants.         Like many heroes of traditional Scandinavian lore, Pippi was fearless, ageless and endowed with superhuman strength.         But above all, Pippi was rude:  deeply, outrageously, satisfyingly rude. Invited to a fancy coffee party, she devoured an entire cream cake before the assembled guests.         The sequel ''Pippi Goes on Board'' was published in Sweden in 1946, followed by ''Pippi in the South Seas'' in 1948, ''Pippi on the Run'' in 1971 and several other Pippi stories not translated into English.         In the 1970's she stepped into public life to protest Sweden's income tax laws, which sent self-employed artists like Mrs. Lindgren and the director Ingmar Bergman reeling under a staggering tax burden. A lifelong supporter of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Mrs. Lindgren published a caustic newspaper satire before the 1976 election in which she calculated that, because of competing local and federal taxes, her income was taxed at an annual rate of 102 percent. The Social Democrats, in power for more than 40 years, were defeated, and tax cuts followed, events Mrs. Lindgren was sometimes credited with bringing about.         Although Mrs. Lindgren's career made her wealthy, she continued to live modestly in the same Stockholm apartment where ''Pippi Longstocking'' was first written, rising early to write in bed before going off to her editing job. She regarded her status as one of Sweden's best loved celebrities with characteristic quiet humor.         ''Perhaps this is because in Stockholm drunks come up and hug me all the time,'' she said in 1994. ''And I cannot be that impressed with anyone, except for God.''       
         Virginia Hamilton, an internationally recognized writer for children whose work celebrated the African-American experience as an essential component of American life, died yesterday in Dayton, Ohio. She was 65 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.         The cause was breast cancer, said Kris Moran, director of publicity for Scholastic, Ms. Hamilton's publisher.         Ms. Hamilton, known privately by her married name, Virginia Hamilton Adoff, wrote more than 35 books in many genres that spanned picture books and folk stories, mysteries and science fiction, realistic novels and biography. Among her best-known works are ''The People Could Fly'' (1985), ''The Planet of Junior Brown'' (1971) and ''Many Thousand Gone: African Americans From Slavery to Freedom'' (1993).         She won a National Book Award in 1975 for her novel ''M. C. Higgins, the Great''; the book also received a Newbery award, the first to a black writer. In 1995 she became the first children's author to receive a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant.         Woven into her books is a deep concern with memory, tradition and generational legacy, especially as they helped define the lives of American blacks from the days of slavery onward. Ms. Hamilton described her work as ''liberation literature.''         Virginia Esther Hamilton was born March 12, 1936. She grew up on the small farm in Yellow Springs that had been her family's since the 1850's;  she later returned there with her husband and children.         She came from a family of storytellers. Ms. Hamilton's grandfather Levi Perry was born a slave in Virginia and crossed the Ohio River to freedom. Once a year, she wrote, he gathered his children around him. ''Set down,'' he would say, ''and I will tell you about slavery and why I ran, so that it will never happen to you.'' Ms. Hamilton was named Virginia in remembrance of his flight.         After attending Antioch College and Ohio State University -- she lacked the money to complete her studies -- Ms. Hamilton moved to New York. There, while studying writing at the New School for Social Research, she met the poet Arnold Adoff, whom she married in 1960. Mr. Adoff survives her, as do two sisters, Nina Anthony, of Columbus, Ohio, and Barbara Davis, of Los Angeles; two brothers, William Hamilton, of Englewood, N.J., and Kenneth James Hamilton Jr., of Chula Vista, Calif.; a daughter, Leigh Hamilton Adoff, of Berlin, and a son, Jaime Levi Adoff, of Manhattan.         Ms. Hamilton's first book, ''Zeely,'' appeared in 1967. At the time the few children's books about black people were mainly ''problem'' novels, which threw into sharp relief issues like segregation and poverty.         ''Zeely'' was a radical departure. It was not that race was absent, but that it was so completely, unremarkably present. Ms. Hamilton forsook gritty urban drama for a pastoral tale of enchantment whose characters happened to be black. The novel told the story of a girl who, during a summer on her uncle's farm, is captivated by an enigmatic local woman she believes is a Watusi queen.         Among Ms. Hamilton's many honors were an Edgar Allan Poe Award, a Coretta Scott King Award, a Hans Christian Andersen Medal and an honorary doctorate from Ohio State.         Many of her recent books were devoted to the black oral tradition; she combed dusty archives for early manuscripts with long-forgotten songs, riddles and stories.         The fruits of her travels included ''The People Could Fly,'' which retells slaves' traditional tales in an accessible vernacular, without the ugly misspellings historically used to render black dialect. The title story recounts: ''The one called Driver cracked his whip over the slow ones to make them move faster. That whip was a slice-open cut of pain. So they did move faster. Had to.''         The book's carefully worded subtitle, ''American Black Folktales,'' was itself a political statement, Ms. Hamilton later recalled. Her editor had urged on her the more conventional  ''Black American Folktales.''         ''No,'' Ms. Hamilton replied. ''They're American first and black second.''       
         Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, whose troubled private life aroused both worldwide sympathy and widespread reprobation, died yesterday morning in London. She was 71.         She suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon, the latest in a series that had left her partly paralyzed in recent months, and developed heart problems overnight, Buckingham Palace said.         The queen announced the death ''with great sadness,'' according to a statement from the palace.         Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is touring West Africa, said he was ''deeply saddened.''         Attractive and fun-loving, Princess Margaret earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit. But her 20's were clouded by an unlucky romance with Group Capt. Peter Townsend of the Royal Air Force, a Battle of Britain hero with whom she fell in love when he served as an equerry to her father, King George VI.         A Daunting Hurdle: Divorce         In many ways, the group captain  might have made an ideal husband. But the fact that he was divorced raised strong objections from the very establishment the royal family represented. As queen, Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, was the supreme governor of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. Moreover, in the early 1950's, the political storm surrounding Edward VIII's abdication in December 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Warfield Simpson, was a not-so-distant memory.         News media scrutiny was relentless and the pressure intense on Princess Margaret, then third in line to the throne, to break off the relationship. Bowing to the demands of a moral code that a decade later would seem quaint to many people, she chose not to marry him.         In May 1960 she married Anthony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who was himself the child of divorced parents. Their tempestuous marriage produced two children, but ended in divorce in 1978. The princess did not remarry, but her friendships with men, from prominent people like the actor Peter Sellers to less exalted ones like Roderic Llewellyn, an upper-class drifter 17 years her junior whose main accomplishment appeared to be a talent for gardening, hurt her reputation.         So did the fact that she was often less than gracious when faced with the drudgery of public appearances -- the ribbon-cuttings, diplomatic functions and endless other official occasions by which Britain's royals justify their position and the public money that finances it. Easily bored and often petulant, the princess was known for indulging her moods, which could swing, as Charles Hussey, a British journalist wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, from ''a gaiety that was sometimes febrile'' to ''Hanoverian gloom.''         Her extravagant style also prompted outrage. Her wedding cost the British government £25,000 -- then the equivalent of $65,000 -- and her six-week honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia cost £40,000, or about $115,000. In later years she was criticized for demanding motorcycle escorts and government helicopters to travel around Britain.         Yet admirers spoke warmly of her personal generosity, loyalty to the queen and to her friends, and her irreverent sense of of fun. Louis Armstrong, whose music she loved, once referred to her as ''one hip chick,'' and John Lennon playfully nicknamed her ''Priceless Margarine.''         To many people, Princess Margaret was the black sheep of her generation of royals. But that reputation did not necessarily trouble her. According to a biographer, Theo Aronson, she once told the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, ''Disobedience is my joy.''         Princess Margaret Rose was born on Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis, Scotland, the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, six years before her father became King George VI with the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.         The Family Braved the Blitz         She was educated at home with her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth II.  During World War II, when the king and queen tried to present an image of both stoicism and good cheer to a battered nation, they rejected the suggestion that their two daughters be sent to Canada to be safe from the danger of the blitz. Instead, the two girls remained with their parents, very much in the public eye.         But with Elizabeth clearly being groomed as the next queen, Princess Margaret was often relegated to the background. According to some courtiers, her parents tried to make up for it by indulging her. ''When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one,'' Princess Margaret told Andrew Duncan, author of ''The Reality of Monarchy'' (1970). ''That was boring so the press tried to make out that I was wicked as hell.''         But in threadbare postwar Britain, the press often portrayed her as a glamorous, high-spirited young woman who delighted in trips to Paris and dancing through the night in fashionable London clubs.         After Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece in November 1947, Princess Margaret became one of the most eligible single women in the world, and her name was coupled with various fashionable young men.         She first met Group Captain Townsend during the war, when he joined King George's entourage. The group captain's heroism -- he shot down 11 German planes -- was coupled with a low-key style that appealed to the king. Indeed, King George was godfather to one of his two sons by his wife, Rosemary Pawle, whom he married in 1941 and divorced in 1952 on the ground of adultery.         His relationship with the princess grew closer after the king's death in February 1952, but it did not become public until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, when Margaret, in a gesture of affection that was captured by news photographers, brushed some lint from his uniform.         Princess Margaret was then 22 and Group Captain Townsend 38. He later wrote that their love ''took no heed of wealth and rank and all the other worldly, conventional barriers which separated us.''         But under the Royal Marriages Act, passed in the reign of George III, Princess Margaret could not marry without the sovereign's permission. Under intense media scrutiny, the affair became as politicized as the one involving King Edward and Mrs. Simpson 16 years before. Both Winston Churchill and the queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, advised against allowing the marriage. Pressing Group Captain Townsend to end the romance, the British government posted him to the British Embassy in Brussels as air attaché in June 1953. Princess Margaret learned of his posting while she was on a tour of Rhodesia.  After her return, the lovers kept in touch by telephone and managed to see each other secretly.         But the government continued to oppose a marriage, and though Princess Margaret turned 25 in 1955 and was thus free to marry without the queen's consent, it was made plain to her that if she chose to marry Group Captain Townsend she would lose her royal rights and income. In October of that year, the couple met in Britain, discussed their situation, and came to a decision.         ''I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend,'' Princess Margaret announced in a statement. ''Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.''         Sympathetic observers later said that if the couple had been permitted to marry, the princess would have settled down to a more conventional life, like her sister. But in his 1978 autobiography, ''Time and Chance,''  Group Captain Townsend wrote, ''I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.''         In 1959 the group captain married Marie Luce Jamagne, a 20-year-old Belgian. The next year, on May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Mr. Armstrong-Jones, also a commoner, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon.         A photographer who made a successful career out of photographing the rich and famous, Mr. Armstrong-Jones also enjoyed the the Bohemian side of London life. He and the princess helped liven the staid image of the royal family with a touch of the Swinging Sixties.         Garland Was Not Amused         But Princess Margaret's love of fun and informality coexisted with a  sterner side. She insisted that she be addressed as ''Ma'am,'' except for her closest friends, who were permitted to call her ''Ma'am darling.'' As a houseguest she was notoriously demanding. At parties she often objected if other guests ignored royal protocol and left before her. Even her children were expected to refer to her as ''Princess Margaret'' in front of visitors. So did her husband,  though he was said to have called her Ducky in private.         The haughty manner alienated many friends. Mr. Aronson relates in ''Princess Margaret'' (1977) how at a party in Beverly Hills she once told Judy Garland through an intermediary that she would like to hear her sing. Angered by the form of the request, Miss Garland replied, ''Tell her I'll sing if she christens a ship first.''         Although the princess and her husband appeared to have a happy family life, by the late 1960's there were nasty public quarrels. This, coupled with an often ill-concealed irritability at official functions and a love of reveling, brought growing public ridicule.         Increasingly resentful of life in the public eye, Lord Snowdon began to spend more time away from the princess, working abroad on photographic projects, sometimes in the company of attractive young women. Princess Margaret also went her own way. She was linked romantically with Anthony Barton, a friend of her husband, and then had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and former army officer who was the nephew of a former prime minister and played the piano in nightclubs.         In February 1967, when the British press began reporting that the royal couple were about to break up, Lord Snowdon, who was working overseas, and Princess Margaret arranged to meet in New York and fly on to the Bahamas, trying to give the impression that nothing was amiss. Shortly afterward, Princess Margaret wrote to Mr. Douglas-Home breaking off the affair. Eighteen months later he committed suicide.         Although the royal couple had made a show of togetherness and were often photographed with their children -- David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones (Viscount Linley) and Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (Lady Sarah Chatto) -- their relations continued to deteriorate.         At Home on a Caribbean Isle         Princess Margaret was often seen in the company of famous men, including Mr. Sellers. She also began to spend more time on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where a friend, Colin Tenant, had given her land as a wedding present and where she built a vacation home known as Les Jolies-Eaux.         In September 1973, at a luncheon in Edinburgh, she met the 25-year-old  Roderic Llewellyn, who soon became a favorite companion. The son of minor nobility, Mr. Llewellyn had worked briefly at a mine in southern Africa and as an apprentice brewer in England. Five months after meeting Princess Margaret he spent three weeks as her guest in Mustique. Although their relationship was soon an open secret in royal circles. the queen, according to Mr. Aronson, was said to have disapproved of Mr. Llewellyn and what she called ''my sister's guttersnipe life.'' But the liaison remained unknown to the public.         Then in February 1976 a news photographer's picture of the couple together on the island caused a scandal. In March the royal family announced that Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret were separating.         Meanwhile, the relationship between the princess and Mr. Llewellyn set off a storm in Parliament. When Mr. Llewellyn was hospitalized with stomach problems during a trip to the Caribbean in March 1978, reports that the princess went to his bedside prompted critics to demand that her royal allowance -- then more than $100,000 a year -- be cut. The battle was played out in the newspapers, with some calling for her to end her relationship with Mr. Llewellyn and take her work more seriously, and others writing in her defense.         Although she was patron of more than 80 charities and organizations, colonel in chief of the Highland Fusiliers of Canada and president of the Royal Ballet, there was increasing resentment of her approach to her duties. Critics complained that the number of her public appearances, which had once averaged 150 a year, had dwindled to well below 100. Some Labor members of Parliament called her an embarrassment to the monarchy.         Then in May, while she was hospitalized with hepatitis, Kensington Palace, where she lived, issued a statement announcing her divorce, an action that ended a 400-year-old taboo on divorce in the royal family.         In the fall, Princess Margaret, on an official visit to Tuvalu in the South Pacific, became ill and had to be flown to Sydney, Australia, for treatment. That December, a month after her return to Britain, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who had been married to a film director.         Princess Margaret's traumatic private life had long taken a toll on her health. She smoked heavily and her enthusiasm for Scotch sometimes shocked her companions. In 1974, according to Mr. Aronson, she suffered a nervous breakdown.         The princess herself remained reticent about her private life. ''I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast,'' she once said.         Sometimes, however, she had a penchant for saying the wrong thing. In October 1979, six weeks after Earl Mountbatten was killed by Irish Republican Army terrorists, she angered many Irish-Americans while on a visit to Chicago, reportedly declaring in the presence of Mayor Jane Byrne that the Irish were ''pigs.''         But she could also be quite gracious. In 1980, when Mr. Llewellyn told her that he was breaking off their relationship to marry Tatiania Soskin, a fashion designer, she assured the younger couple she would be happy to attend their wedding, and she remained friends with both.         Lunch With an Old Lover         As the 1980's progressed, public interest turned to the romantic travails of the next generation of royals. Two of the queen's three sons -- Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Andrew, the Duke of York -- married and divorced under the glare of relentless publicity. Anne, the princess royal and the queen's only daughter, was permitted to divorce her husband, Capt. Mark Philips, and in 1992 married a royal equerry.         Through the years the princess  had corresponded with Peter Townsend and in 1992, while he was on a rare visit to Britain, she invited him to lunch at Kensington Palace attended by several other people. The 77-year-old group captain and the 61-year-old princess sat and ''chatted like the old friends they were.'' Group Captain Townsend died in Paris in 1995.         It was often speculated how different her life might have been had the two been allowed to marry.         ''In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, at the time of Group Captain  Townsend's death. ''After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret's life. The queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they've gone too far in the other direction.''         Princess Margaret is survived by her son, Lord Linley, her daughter, Lady Sarah, and three grandchildren.         As she grew older, the princess  lived less in the public eye. ''They leave me alone these days,'' Mr. Aronson quoted her as saying. ''Today they have other fish to fry.''         Correction:  February 15, 2002, Friday  Because of an editing error, a television review on Feb. 4 about ''Bertie and Elizabeth,'' a ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation on the life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, misstated the policy of the Church of England on divorce, a factor in the abdication of her brother-in-law King Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor. An obituary of her daughter Princess Margaret on Sunday also included the error. The church does not forbid divorce. It revokes the right to marry in a parish church while a former spouse is living. But even then, depending on circumstances, a priest can allow a church wedding.       
         Rosetta LeNoire, a theatrical producer and a pioneer of nontraditional casting who also played the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on the television show ''Family Matters,'' died on Sunday in Teaneck, N.J. She was 90.         She lived at the Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home in Englewood, N.J., after spending most of her life in the Bronx, said Donna Trinkoff, producing director of the Amas Musical Theater. Miss LeNoire founded Amas, a nonprofit theater group, in 1968, partly to promote interracial casting. The company produced hits including ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         Miss LeNoire's life coincided with glittering moments in show business. Her godfather was Bill Robinson, the tap dancer known as Bojangles, and her music teacher was the jazz pianist and composer Eubie Blake. She was directed by Orson Welles in his all-black version of ''Macbeth'' in the 1930's.         She acted in some of the earliest television shows, and once joked that she seemed to play every maid's role on Broadway.         Perhaps as a result, she was an early and effective advocate of expanding opportunities for minority performers to act in plays and musicals. In 1989, her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who was then president of Actors' Equity, chose Miss LeNoire as the first recipient of what became the union's annual award for broadening participation in theater. The award was named for her.         ''Rosetta created nontraditional casting before the phrase itself was created,'' The New York Beacon, a newspaper with a largely black readership, said in 1997.         In 1999, President Clinton lauded her long fight against discrimination as he presented her with the National Medal of the Arts, one of her many honors.         ''Rosetta did more than dream of a theater with no color bar -- she actually built one,'' he said.         Miss LeNoire, whose name was originally Rosetta Burton, was born in 1911 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan. Her paternal grandfather played the organ for five churches in the West Indies, and her father was one of the first black plumbers and electricians licensed by New York State.         When she was a child, her mother died of pneumonia at the age of 27 after giving birth to her brother in a Harlem hospital corridor because segregated policies barred her from a room. Rosetta was crippled with rickets, a result of vitamin deprivation, and when she was 7 doctors broke her legs so the bones could grow properly.         Mr. Robinson, a member of the Elks Club with her father, volunteered to become godfather of the girl he called Brown Sugar. At 13, when her leg braces came off, she began music lessons with Mr. Blake, who told her to ''look up and be proud of yourself.'' When she was 15, she became a chorus girl with the Time Steppers, Mr. Robinson's troupe.         A marriage to an elevator operator ended in divorce. She then married Egbert Brown, who owned a fleet of cabs; he died after 26 years of marriage.         She is survived by her son, William, of Manahawkin, N.J.; her sister, Mary A. Francis of Palm Coast, Fla.; her brothers, Wilmote Burton of the Bronx, and Warren Burton of Palm Coast; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Study at a government-sponsored Works Progress Administration program at a theater on the Lower East Side led to a role in the all-black version of ''Macbeth,'' which Orson Welles was producing in Harlem. She toured with the production.         ''Good lord! He was a delegate from heaven,'' she said of Mr. Welles. ''He was the only one who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to Shakespeare.''         Later she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to acting, she cared for Mr. Jones's infant son, James Earl Jones.         She made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''The Hot Mikado,'' an all-black version of the operetta.         ''It was something,'' she said. ''There were 125 of us, all black Japanese.''         Her other theater credits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Sunshine Boys,'' ''Lost in the Stars,'' ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Sophie.'' She played the role of Stella in ''Anna Lucasta'' in 1944, toured with the show and starred in the 1958 film version, with Sammy Davis Jr. and Eartha Kitt. Her other movie credits include ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Playing for Keeps'' and ''Brewster's Millions.''         She worked in television during its experimental days, and later appeared in ''Search for Tomorrow,'' ''The Guiding Light,'' ''Amen'' and ''A World Apart. She played Nell Carter's mother, Mama, on NBC's ''Gimme a Break'' and was Mother Winslow on ABC's ''Family Matters'' for eight years.         Eight years after founding Amas, she added a children's theatrical course to its program. (Amas is a form of the verb ''to love'' in Latin.) The company's hits included ''Bojangles'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' a Tony nominee in 1976.         ''I produce musicals,'' she said. ''Music is one avenue where no one seems to have any discriminatory attitudes.''       
         Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the enduringly popular grande dame of the British royal family and the country's most beloved symbol of courage and self-sacrifice during World War II, died in her sleep this afternoon at the Royal Lodge at Windsor Palace, a spokesman for her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, announced. She was 101.         In a life longer than the 20th century, the queen mother presided over a period of turbulence and change in Britain, helping to sustain the monarchy through the most serious crises to befall it in modern times.         In 1936, when her painfully diffident husband was crowned King George VI after the abdication of his older brother, she became the strength behind the throne, helping transform him from a stammering, insecure second son into a loved and respected monarch.         As queen during World War II, her decision to remain in London through the worst days of the blitz proved a rallying point for Britons desperate for the sort of leadership that only a monarch could provide. And when Buckingham Palace was bombed, she forever endeared herself to the nation by declaring herself in solidarity with the working-class people of London's bomb-ravaged East End.         ''I am almost glad we have been bombed,'' she said, in what became one of the war's most memorable remarks. ''Now I feel I can look the East End in the face.''         Many years later, through the traumas of the divorce and then the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, her granddaughter-in-law, the queen mother proved to be the royal family's most resiliently popular member, providing the country with a rock-steady reason for remaining a monarchy. News of her death today dealt a blow to Britons accustomed to her enduring presence. [Page 16.]         When King George died in 1952, she was thrust at the age of 51 into what would be the longest role of her life: that of the queen mother, necessarily taking a back seat to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. But in the eyes of a country that never lost its abiding affection for its good-natured ''Queen Mum,'' it was a role she fulfilled with grace, carrying out a grueling schedule of public engagements well into her 90's and never losing her common touch, which included a healthy appetite for a glass or two of gin and a love of horse racing and trout fishing.         ''She is the nation's favorite great-grandmother, seemingly known intimately to all of us for years,'' The Times of London declared in 1985, on the occasion of the queen mother's 85th birthday (she celebrated it by flying on the Concorde). ''She has helped make the royal family more secure in the nation's affections than it has been at any other time in history.''         Ben Pimlott, the historian and royal biographer, wrote in 1997 that the queen mother was ''the last survivor of the tiny club of center-stage actors of the Second World War.'' He continued: ''She has also shown a chameleon-like ability to adapt to shifting conditions, something her deeply conservative nature makes the more remarkable. Unlike most public figures, she does not date. She has never made an intellectual remark in her life. Her knack has been to look for the best in people and offer a kind of looking glass to the virtues they would like to have.''         Father Was an Eccentric         Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was born in London on Aug. 4, 1900, in the waning days of the reign of Queen Victoria, a golden time for the British monarchy and its empire. She was the fourth daughter and ninth child of Lord Glamis, a Scottish nobleman whose family occupied Glamis Castle in Scotland, said to be the place where Macbeth murdered Duncan in Shakespeare's play. When his father died four years later, Lord Glamis inherited a considerable fortune and an even more impressive title, becoming the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis.         Lord Strathmore was a bona fide aristocratic eccentric. He had a deep mistrust of eggs (''Poison, my dear, poison,'' he would intone ominously at the breakfast table) and a habit of dragging dead branches from his woods in the middle of the night. Dressed in an old raincoat tied with string, he would then split them into logs for the fire.         Raised partly at Glamis and partly in the fashionable Knightsbridge section of London, the young Lady Elizabeth was by all accounts sunny almost to a fault. Her favorite hobby, she once wrote in an autograph album, was ''making friends.''         Indifferently educated by governesses, Elizabeth spent much of her youth doing what young aristocratic women generally did at the time: learning arts like household management and enjoying herself. The real world intruded during World War I, though, when her brothers went off to fight and Glamis was turned for four years into a convalescent home for soldiers. Wanting to protect her mother from bad news, Elizabeth made sure to waylay the mailman every morning so that she could read the mail first. In fact, there was bad news: one of Elizabeth's brothers was killed, sending Lady Strathmore into a depression from which she never really recovered.         When the war was over, Elizabeth's social life, essentially an extended search for a husband in the guise of a series of amusing diversions, began in earnest. Her biographers tend to agree that she was a great success as a debutante, flirting wildly and constantly fending off a large coterie of broken-hearted suitors, one of whom reportedly -- and unromantically -- serenaded her by cracking his hunting whip under her bedroom window at night.         Elizabeth and Bertie         Although history is hazy on facts, several biographers say there was one suitor whom Elizabeth was genuinely in love with: Maj. James Stuart, the equerry to Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, the Duke of York and King George V's second son. But if there was a romance there, it never went anywhere. Albert began courting Elizabeth himself, and Major Stuart ended up being summarily shipped off to work on an oil rig in Oklahoma. The day before Elizabeth's wedding, he announced his own engagement to one of her friends.         The romance between Elizabeth and Bertie, as the prince was known, apparently did not begin promisingly. Bullied by his parents and overshadowed by his handsome and charming older brother, David, the Prince of Wales, Bertie suffered from delicate health, crippling shyness, an array of nervous tics, a terrible stutter, an unpredictable temper, a tendency to melancholy and what today would be described as a serious case of low self-esteem. When he asked his parents' permission to pursue Elizabeth, his father murmured, ''You'll be a lucky fellow if she accepts you.''         Elizabeth did resist Bertie's attentions for several years, finally accepting his proposal in 1923 and thus agreeing to become the first commoner (anyone below the rank of peer or peeress) to marry so close to the throne since the 17th century. It was when her engagement was announced that Lady Elizabeth had her first and only on-the-record conversation with a reporter. The interview was harmless enough -- ''I play golf, badly, and I am fond of lawn tennis,'' she confided -- but she was roundly rebuked by the king, and never gave another interview.         The wedding was a national extravaganza, but afterward Elizabeth, now the Duchess of York, settled in relatively modest circumstances, at least by royal standards. Though the house she shared with Bertie at 145 Piccadilly, London, had 25 bedrooms and 21 servants, it was hardly a palace, and it opened onto a communal garden at the back. They had two children, Elizabeth, known as Lilibet, and Margaret Rose, and the Duchess settled into a pleasant life of regal domesticity, saying her main duty was ''bringing up her children.''         Another duty was bucking up the flagging spirits of her husband, who hated the spotlight but who was required to make many public appearances, particularly as his father's health waned and his older brother proved more interested in a racy social life than in boring regal duties. But while in many ways the personalities of the Yorks could not have been more different -- she was ebullient where he was glum, relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was laconic -- they were surprisingly well suited.         Among other things, Elizabeth forced Bertie to seek treatment for what was delicately referred to as his ''affliction,'' and the two visited a Harley Street doctor nearly every day for some two and a half months, as Bertie learned to keep his stutter in check. The marriage proved to be just what the future king needed, Bertie's official biographer, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, would later write. ''It brought him much for which he had long craved in deprivation -- love, understanding, sympathy, support,'' he said. ''All these things were now his in generous abundance, and his whole conspectus of life changed accordingly.''         Edward and Mrs. Simpson         The coziness of their early years was abruptly shattered in 1936, when King Edward VIII, as Bertie's older brother styled himself on ascending the throne, announced that he had fallen inconveniently in love with the very married Wallis Simpson, an American whose earlier divorce from her first husband had already ruled her out as a possible royal bride.         Not even the exhortations of his most trusted advisers, or the frightened tears of his younger brother, would make Edward give up Mrs. Simpson, and on Dec. 10, 1936, he abdicated and left for France. Mrs. Simpson got a divorce in 1937, and the two eventually married, adopted a flotilla of small dogs, and spent the rest of their lives in glamorous if bitter exile as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         The terrified Bertie was left behind to comfort a shocked nation and to try to rise to the occasion. ''Dickie, this is absolutely terrible,'' he told his friend and cousin Lord Mountbatten. ''I'm quite unprepared for it. David has been trained for this all his life. I've never even seen a state paper.'' It was clear, even then, how much he depended on Elizabeth. ''With my wife and helpmeet by my side, I take up the heavy burden which lies before me,'' he said on his first day as king.         Elizabeth may have seemed complaisant and sweet, but she had a ''steel hand within a velvet glove,'' in the words of Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, and she never forgave David or Wallis Simpson for throwing her husband to the wolves. ''She can forgive any act but treachery, and then she is implacable as any Scot,'' wrote Dorothy Laird, one of Elizabeth's biographers. ''The wound goes very deep.'' Most of her anger, it seems, was directed against the duchess.         Bertie himself was so unnerved that he never mentioned Wallis's name, referring to her in his diary as ''Mrs. S.,'' but the queen certainly had a hand in ensuring that she and her brother-in-law had as rough a time as possible. On the eve of their wedding and in a move that foreshadowed the battle over a post-divorce title for Diana, the Princess of Wales, more than 50 years later, the couple were informed that while the duke would continue to be styled ''royal highness,'' the duchess would not. The wedding was a tiny, fraught affair, with only 12 guests, none from David's family.         Acutely sensitive to what they saw as the duke's efforts to set up an unofficial rival court, the king and queen continually thwarted David's efforts to return home with Wallis. It was not until 30 years later, with Bertie long dead, that Elizabeth was to come face to face again with her hated sister-in-law, whom she always called in private ''the woman who killed my husband.'' (Wallis was not particularly fond of her, either, referring to her as ''Cookie'' in a disparaging reference to her plumpness.)         The crisis having been weathered, the new king and queen set out to remove some of the stuffiness from royal life, dispensing, for instance, with the custom of requiring the king's daughters to curtsy to him. But they would soon find other matters preoccupying them, as the country became consumed with the specter of impending war. The king tried valiantly, if ineffectually, to do his part for diplomacy, preparing a personal letter to Hitler in 1938 that appealed to him ''as one ex-serviceman to another'' and begged him to spare the world from another war. (In the end, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, sternly if gently forbade the King to send the letter.)         The King and the President         Early in 1939, Elizabeth and Bertie traveled to Hyde Park, N.Y., to visit Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, the president and first lady of the United States. The trip, in which they had their first taste of hot dogs, cemented a friendship that was to prove helpful in obtaining American support for the war effort later. In her memoirs, Mrs. Roosevelt described the easy banter between the king and the president.         ''My mother does not approve of cocktails and thinks you should have a cup of tea,'' Roosevelt said. ''Neither does my mother,'' the king replied. Then they both had cocktails.         War broke out in August, when Hitler invaded Poland, and Elizabeth was formally advised by the British cabinet to take her daughters to Canada until the danger was past. She refused to go, stoutly declaring that ''the princesses would never leave without me, and I wouldn't leave without the king, and the king will never leave.'' Instead, she remained in London, enthusiastically taking target practice at the palace with a revolver that was a gift from the new prime minister, Winston Churchill.         The royal family's role in wartime was a largely ceremonial one -- visiting Red Cross centers, civil defense installations, air-raid shelters, hospitals and munition factories; comforting the wounded, and boosting the morale of soldier and civilian alike --but the importance of such ceremony at such a time cannot be overstated.         ''Your majesty, don't you know what you mean to all of us in this country?'' the minister of food at the time, Lord Woolton, once said to Elizabeth. ''It isn't only your high position that matters; it is the fact that the vast majority of people think of you as a person who would speak the kindly word, and, if it fell within your power, would take the cup of hot soup to the needy person.''         Though the king made secret visits to the troops and Elizabeth made a point of visiting places that had been bombed, invariably wearing a smart dress and pearls, they were relatively unaffected personally until Sept. 13, 1940. That day, as the royal couple sat in one of their living rooms at Buckingham Palace, the palace was struck by half a dozen German bombs, which damaged its courtyard and destroyed its chapel. Although they were able to take refuge in an unusually upscale bomb shelter, prepared by the queen with handsome furniture and a supply of fashion magazines, it was then that the queen made her enduring remark about being able ''to look the East End in the eye.''         In a biography of Elizabeth, the royal writer Anthony Holden called it ''a phrase which will reverberate through the history of the British monarchy's relations with its people.'' He continued, ''Never before, or indeed since, had such a strength of fellow-feeling been so genuine and so widely shared.''         A Spartan Windsor Castle         The queen also made it clear that she was determined to adhere to strict rules of wartime economy. Although the royal family's life was naturally easier than that of most of her countrymen, it was still rigorously ascetic. Windsor Castle, where Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were to spend the next five years, had no heat except for the occasional space heater, and just one bare bulb for each room.         When Mrs. Roosevelt visited Buckingham Palace in 1942, she found a bathtub painted with a black line above which water was not supposed to rise; food that was close to inedible (and severely rationed) and rooms that were so cold that the women wore fur coats and blankets indoors.         Not even Churchill escaped. Accustomed to eating meager sandwiches served by the queen during his weekly luncheon meetings with the king, he found on one occasion that the food was even more horrific than usual. ''I don't know what is in these sandwiches,'' the king told the prime minister. ''Sawdust, I suppose.''         The king's always fragile health was not improved by the stresses of the war or by his lifelong smoking habit, and after victory was declared in 1945, he began the long, slow decline that would result in his death, from lung cancer, in 1952. With the death of her husband, Elizabeth had to face the fact that she was no longer on center stage, would have to leave Buckingham Palace, and would, if protocol was strictly followed, have to curtsy to her own daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Riven with grief, she wrote to President Eisenhower that ''one cannot imagine life without him, but one must carry on as he would have wished.''         In the past, widowed mothers of monarchs were known as queen dowagers, but Elizabeth rejected that title in favor of the more impressive one she held to her death: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. As queen mother, she lost neither her formidability nor her ability to influence. The new queen was just 25 when she ascended the throne, and relied heavily on the advice of her mother. The operators at Clarence House, which became the queen mother's official residence, soon became used to putting through her daughter's daily telephone call: ''Your majesty?'' they would say, ''I have her majesty on the line, your majesty.''         Another Divorce Crisis         Soon afterward, another crisis befell the monarchy when Princess Margaret, the queen mother's younger daughter, fell in love with a divorced man, Peter Townsend, a hero of the Battle of Britain. It is unclear what role her mother played in the queen's decision to inform Margaret that she would have to give up her royal status and leave the country if she married Mr. Townsend, but the lessons of Edward's abdication were surely not lost to her now. The princess gave up her beau, married the photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones five years later, and ended up divorcing him 15 years after that. Margaret died on Feb. 9, predeceasing her mother by less than two months.         Bolstered by a large staff, a number of houses at her disposal, and an allowance of more than $1 million a year from Parliament, the queen mother kept up a busy schedule that began to ease up only when she was in her 80's. She served as either president or patron of 312 British organizations, ranging, as one biographer put it, ''from the Royal Agricultural Society to the Dachshund Club.'' As a link to the past, a symbol of continuity, and, to many, a potent reminder of Britain's finest hour, the she remained a familiar figure even in her late 90's, in her cheerful, brightly colored dresses, large flowery hats and ready smile.         Her health problems over the years always became a cause for concern in a country that simply did not want her to die. She had two hip-replacement operations in her late 90's, which invariably ended with her hobbling slowly out of the hospital while crowds of well-wishers cheered. What the public did not learn, until it was finally reported by the news media much later, was that she underwent a colostomy in 1966 and had to wear a bag to collect her wastes for the rest of her life.         In recent years, there were niggling criticisms of the queen mother: that she was a bon vivant who spent far beyond her means; that she kept too many houses and employed too many servants and generally thought too much of her own comfort. But such sniping was relatively muted.         She remained popular because, in a very different and much more real way than Diana had been, she was a monarch who never lost the common touch. Nor did she lose her rather sly, flirtatious smile, her beguiling manner (''I work awfully hard, but Mummy has all the charm,'' her daughter Elizabeth once said) or her easy way with the public.         Reveling in meeting and chatting to new people (''If we do not pass on, I shall soon pass out,'' her husband once said as Elizabeth persisted in chatting at a public appearance), she was also eternally tactful and diplomatic. At a luncheon on a trip to South Africa, she once listened patiently as an irate Afrikaaner mayor complained about the indignities his countrymen had suffered at the hands of the English. ''Oh, I do understand so well,'' Elizabeth responded. ''That's just how we feel about them in Scotland.''         And once, after touring a garden in London, she stayed on for tea. ''I hear you like gin?'' her hostess blurted out, instantly afraid of appearing tactless. But the queen mother thought it delightful.         ''I hadn't realized I enjoyed that reputation,'' she replied. ''But as I do, perhaps you could make it a large one.''         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother yesterday misstated the name of the royal estate where she died. It is Windsor Castle, not Windsor Palace.         Correction:  April 3, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on Sunday misstated the date of Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, which prompted the cabinet to suggest that she take her daughters to Canada. It was Sept. 1, not in August.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Kimberly Miles, recipient of a lung transplant in November 2000 in an unusual operation in which her sister and a friend donated parts of their lungs, died on Monday in Minneapolis. She was 33.         The cause was cystic fibrosis.         Ms. Miles was born with the disease, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system and other organs. The average age at death is about 30.         Ms. Miles still managed a full life in her hometown, Black River Falls, Wis., where she lived with her son, Cole, 9, and his father, Larry Schultz. By 2000, she was spending much time in the hospital with lung infections. Doctors said they did not believe that she would live long enough to receive a transplant from a cadaver.         Ms. Miles's sister Tammy Hoff and a friend, DorMae Gebhardt, both in their early 30's with families of their own, offered to be donors.         Ms. Miles's surgeon, Dr. Soon Park, had performed lung transplants from living donors, but had never encountered a case in which a donor was not a blood relative, he said. Of 956 lung transplants performed in 2000, just 15 came from living donors.         Dr. Park predicted that after the surgery Ms. Miles would walk and probably even run.         The operations were described in a front-page article about donors of living organs in The New York Times on June 24, 2001, and they were the subject of ''A Gift of Life,'' a Science Times television program that was first shown on June 26, 2001, on the National Geographic Channel.         Technically, Ms. Miles's transplant was successful, and her new lungs, consisting of a lobe of one lung from each donor, worked well.         But she soon developed digestive problems, probably from the cystic fibrosis. She also began to retain fluid and became so swollen that she had difficulty getting around.         Ms. Hoff said her sister fought hard to overcome the problems, but finally asked not to be put on a respirator again or subjected to more invasive procedures.         She died at Fairview University Hospital surrounded by family members and Dr. Park.         ''We had no cure for her,'' Dr. Park said.         He said that ultimately he did not think that the transplant improved Ms. Miles's quality of life and that if he had foreseen the course of her disease, he would probably not have performed the operations.         But there was no way to predict her outcome, he added. The University of Minnesota, which has performed five lung transplants using living donors, will continue its plan of performing a total of 10 such operations and then evaluating the results, Dr. Park said, ''to see whether this is a responsible thing to do or not.''         Three of the five recipients are doing well. One is a young woman with cystic fibrosis, he said.         Ms. Gebhardt and Ms. Hoff said they had no regrets about the operations.         ''I guess it works on some and not on others,'' Ms. Gebhardt said. ''We knew that from the start. It was a chance everybody took. We tried, and it's all we could do.''         Ms. Hoff said, ''The only thing I regret is her not getting quality of life out of it.''         In addition to her son, his father and Ms. Hoff, Ms. Miles is survived by her parents, Wayne and Liz Miles, and another sister, Debra Bloczynski.       
         Nancy White, the white-gloved editor of Harper's Bazaar during the 1960's, when it captured the spirit of the decade with evocative photographs of models in bikinis, boots and big watches, not to mention spacesuits, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Miss White edited Harper's from 1958 to 1971, at a time when there were only two major women's fashion magazines in America. The other, Vogue, was headed by Diana Vreeland, a far more visible personality.         Her magazine reflected the cultural upheavals of the 1960's, as did she, up to a point: through her three marriages, she insisted on being called Miss White, reflecting the stylishly independent image she strove to project.         ''There were not a lot of female businesspeople then,'' said Katharine Delahaye Paine, her daughter. ''She felt it was important to create the right image.''         When she assumed the top editorial job at Harper's Bazaar in 1958, Miss White jotted down the words she hoped would describe her magazine. As given in the book ''Harper's Bazaar: 100 Years of the American Female'' (Random House, 1967), they were: ''authority, awareness, wit, spirit, surprise, curiosity, intelligence, timing, food for thought, vitality, balance and youth.''         She emphasized photographs -- many by Richard Avedon and Hiro -- that told the story of a new era. They varied from a model posed in front of a missile at Cape Canaveral, to an ethereal picture of a woman in a gown floating in a glass ball, to a model in a shimmering body stocking. Suzy Parker posed in one of the first fashion layouts featuring the bikini.         ''She was one of the grandes dames of her era,'' the designer John Weitz said yesterday. ''She brought taste, charm and a sense of proportion to the game.''         Nancy White was born in Brooklyn on July 25, 1916. Her father was in publishing and became general manager of Hearst magazines.         She attended the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., where she and Katharine Graham, who was to become publisher of The Washington Post, became lifelong friends.         She left Madeira to work during the Depression, her daughter said. At 15, she worked as an errand girl with a magazine, according to an interview with her in The New York Mirror in 1957. (She did not name the magazine.)         She returned to the boarding school, and after graduation became an editorial assistant, or ''glorified errand girl,'' in her words, with the magazine Pictorial Review. Her next job, which lasted 16 years, was with Good Housekeeping magazine, where she started as an assistant in the fashion department and left as fashion editor.         She joined Harper's as an assistant editor in 1957 and was appointed editor at the beginning of 1958. She was chosen by the previous editor, Carmel Snow, who happened to be her aunt. Diana Vreeland had been another candidate for the top job; she promptly quit. In 1962, Mrs. Vreeland joined Vogue, becoming a legend in the fashion world, and not incidentally Miss White's principal competitor.         Under Miss White, Harper's was aimed at stylish women in Des Moines and Omaha as well as in New York and San Francisco. In one issue, 14 pages by Hiro showed models' bodies seeming to disintegrate beneath colorful prints. Yet in the same issue, there was page after black-and-white page of elegantly understated suits and coats.         Her comments on pantsuits in a 1964 interview in The New York Times reflected the balance she sought between modernity and moderation. Although she would not wear one to the office herself, she said, pantsuits would be all right for her staff members if they wore ''perfect accessories.''         Miss White resigned in 1971 after James W. Brady, formerly publisher of Women's Wear Daily, was appointed publisher and editorial director of Harper's. Mr. Brady said it was Hearst's decision for him to modernize the magazine.         ''In all candor, I don't think Nancy White was as significant as Vreeland,'' said Mr. Brady, the author and columnist, who succeeded Miss White as editor of Harper's. ''She always seemed to be wearing white gloves with her hat firmly in place.''         After her resignation, Miss White advised Bergdorf Goodman on fashion for two years and devoted much of the rest of her life to charities, including Lighthouse for the Blind and the public television station WNET.         She was first married to Clarence Dauphinot, founder of Deltec International, then to Ralph D. Paine Jr., publisher of Fortune magazine, and then George K. Thompson, her high school sweetheart. The first two marriages ended in divorce, and Mr. Thompson died in 1996.         She is survived by two daughters, Ms. Paine of Durham, N.H., and Gillette Piper of Coral Gables, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Mimi Thompson of Manhattan; a sister, Carmel Eitt of King George, Va.; a brother, John Michael White of Delray Beach, Fla.; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 1972, Miss White said she did not own a little black dress. But she had a color scheme for each of her four homes.         ''In Manhattan, I'm sort of white and beige,'' she said. ''In Connecticut, I'm yellow and orange and bright green. In New Hampshire, I'm red and white and navy. In Vermont, I'm beige and red.''       
         Josephine R. Abady, a theater director who staged plays on and off Broadway and was a leader in the nonprofit theater movement, died on Saturday in her home in Manhattan. She lived in Manhattan and Stockbridge, Mass. She was 52.         The cause was breast cancer, said her sister, the actress Caroline Aaron.         During her career, Ms. Abady was the artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge and the Cleveland Playhouse. In the last years of Circle in the Square, she shared the artistic direction of that company with Theodore Mann, one of the company's founders, and Mr. Mann named her as his successor.         At Circle in the Square she directed a revival of ''Bus Stop,'' starring Billy Crudup and Mary-Louise Parker, and produced a revival of ''The Rose Tattoo,'' starring Mercedes Ruehl. In 1996, after the theater filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws, both Mr. Mann and Ms. Abady resigned their posts.         After directing Tom Griffin's play ''The Boys Next Door'' at the Berkshire theater, she brought it to New York where it had a successful run at the Lambs Theater. The play featured Josh Mostel, Joe Grifasi and Christine Estabrook as mentally handicapped residents of a cooperative apartment. She also directed the New York premiere of David Storey's ''March on Russia,'' an elegaic portrait of a family in Yorkshire, England. Under Ms. Abady's direction, the American cast exactingly delineated the regional English characters.         In 1991, while she was at the Cleveland Playhouse, she staged a Russian-language version of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' in Volgograd and then brought the play to Cleveland, where local audiences listened to the English translation over headphones.         Ms. Abady was born in Richmond, Va. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master of fine arts from Florida State University. For several years she taught theater at Bennington College and was head of the theater program at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., before beginning her professional career at the Berkshire Theater Festival, where she specialized in revivals of American plays.         When she went to the Cleveland Playhouse, she opened the season with ''Born Yesterday,'' starring Ed Asner and Madeline Kahn, a production that moved to Broadway. Subsequently, she and David Esbjornson directed ''New Music,'' a trilogy by Reynolds Price, and she also presented plays by black and female authors. After six years as artistic director, she was fired by a board of directors that was apparently unhappy with her nontraditional choice of plays.         In 1994, with a grant from the American Film Institute, she made a short film, ''To Catch a Tiger,'' inspired by her mother's work as a civil rights activist in the South. The screenplay was written by Ms. Abady's husband, Michael Krawitz, and starred her sister as her mother.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Great Barrington, Mass., and her sister, of Los Angeles, she is survived by her brother, Samuel Abady of Bronxville, N.Y..         In spite of her illness, she was highly productive in the last year. She ran a lunchtime series of play readings at the National Arts Club in New York, and also directed plays in Texas and Florida. She returned to Richmond to stage Margaret Edson's ''Wit,'' about a woman who is dying of cancer. When interviewed by a local reporter, she said she had not seen the play before she directed it. ''I live 'Wit,' '' she said. ''I don't need to see it.''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Barbara Scott Preiskel, a lawyer whose career helped break down racial barriers in entertainment law as well as on the numerous corporate boards on which she served, died Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her husband, Robert H. Preiskel, said.         Ms. Preiskel, who grew up in Washington and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945, was the second black woman to graduate from Yale Law School, in 1947.         Barbara Scott was born July 6, 1924, in Washington, the daughter of a real estate broker and a chemistry teacher.         Her decades of membership on charity boards began in 1958 with the Hillcrest Center for Children and ended with the Sept. 11 Fund. She had also been on the boards of the New York Community Trust and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, among many others.         She was a lawyer and executive with the Motion Picture Association of America from 1959 to 1983. She helped Jack Valenti, the president of the association, in a legal effort to overturn state and local censorship laws, many of which sought to ban depictions of interracial relationships, on the ground that such laws violated the First Amendment to the Constitution.         Ms. Preiskel was a director of the Washington Post Company, General Electric, Textron, R. H. Macy & Company and Levi Strauss & Company, among others. She was a trustee of Yale, Wellesley and Tougaloo College in Mississippi. She also was chairwoman of the council of advisers to the Hunter College School of Social Work and an adviser to the N.Y.U. Program on Philanthropy and the Law.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her sons, John, of San Francisco, and Richard, of New York, and a grandson, Malakai, of San Francisco.       
         Lorna J. Marshall, a college English instructor turned homemaker who in her 50's began a new life as an anthropologist studying the Bushmen of Africa, died on July 8 at her home in Peterborough, N.H. She was 103.         She had lived with her daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, since 1996, Ms. Thomas said. She previously lived in the same house in Cambridge, Mass., since the late 1920's.         Mrs. Marshall's anthropological career began when her husband, Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and president of the Raytheon Corporation, retired in 1950 with the thought that it was time to get reacquainted with his family.         ''Where is the remotest place we can go and be a family again?'' Mr. Marshall asked, said Irven DeVore, the More research professor of anthropology at Harvard.         The Kalahari Desert was the answer he found. He decided he would take his family to live among the legendary Bushmen.         ''They became a sort of Swiss Family Robinson of the Kalahari,'' Dr. DeVore said.         The family's accomplishments made it more than that. Mr. Marshall helped the Bushmen start a fine-wool industry. The Marshalls' son, John, began his career as a leading maker of ethnographic documentary films. Ms. Thomas, who would go on to write best sellers like ''The Hidden Life of Dogs,'' wrote a well-received book on the Bushmen, ''The Harmless People'' (Knopf, 1958).         Meanwhile, Mrs. Marshall began the painstaking process of documenting the culture and behavior of the Bushmen, sometimes called !Kung. (The ''!'' represents a clicking sound in their language). She was the first of dozens of scholars who have made the Bushmen one of the world's most studied populations of traditional hunter-gatherers.         ''To say she started it is not a mistake,'' Dr. DeVore said. ''By standards of ethnography, she did as well or better than any monograph I know, and she was there early.''         Over the next two decades, the Marshall family made eight trips to the Kalahari, a desert the size of Spain in what is now Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa, staying for as long as a year and a half at a time. Then the family would return to Cambridge, where Mrs. Marshall would employ the best graduate students to organize her voluminous notes, which resulted in two books and many articles.         An honor she particularly valued was having a !Kung baby girl named after her. The child was called Norna, because the Bushmen, for all their ability to make unusual vocal sounds, cannot pronounce the letter L.         Lorna Jean McLean was born in Morenci, a mining town in the Arizona Territory, on Sept. 14, 1898. Her father, Gordon McLean, a mining engineer, died when she was 7. Her mother, the former Bessie Holmes, remarried and moved with her daughter to Riverside, Calif., and then Los Angeles.         Miss McLean graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English. She then gave up the beginning of a career in ballet to travel around the world with her mother, who had been widowed again. They traveled throughout the Middle East and Asia. In China, they met an instructor at Mount Holyoke College who offered Miss McLean a job teaching English.         She accepted, but soon met Mr. Marshall in Nova Scotia, where both had relatives. They married and moved to Cambridge.         At the Cambridge Community Center, she organized women to salvage tungsten wire from radio tubes that Raytheon could re-use in making electronic devices. The salvage operation employed black and white women, unusual at the time, and permitted women to work flexible hours, which was also unusual.         Mr. Marshall said he wanted to do something with his family when he retired, and its members were interested in anthropology. So he asked his wife to take some courses at Harvard, which she did from time to time among trips to Africa.         The family was at first apprehensive about tales of poison darts and trance dances, but found the Bushmen polite and kind. The Marshall family lived in tents, even as temperatures ranged from freezing to 125 degrees.         Mrs. Marshall published her first book, ''!Kung of Nyae Nyae,'' in 1975 (Harvard University Press), and her second, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites,'' three years ago (Peabody Museum Press).         She is survived by her daughter, her son, who lives in Belmont, Mass., three grandchildren and three great-granddaughters.         She is remembered by others. A year or so after her 100th birthday party, the child of a Bushman she had known as a child came to visit her.       
         Joan Littlewood, the producer, director and author who was one of the most important and original figures responsible for the regeneration of the British theater in the 1950's and 60's, died Friday in London at the home of her assistant. She was 87.         Ms. Littlewood's Theater Workshop, based in a shabby old playhouse in a poor section of East London, won an international reputation with seasons of offbeat work that she staged by herself. These included ''Oh What a Lovely War,'' a vaudeville-style re-creation of key events in the First World War; ''The Quare Fellow'' and ''The Hostage,'' two plays by her protégé, the Irish dramatist Brendan Behan; and ''A Taste of Honey,'' a bleak portrait of life in Northern England by the 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney.         As early as 1956 the critic Harold Hobson could declare that Theater Workshop was known throughout Europe as ''England's premier company.''         As much as the kitchen-sink drama of John Osborne and others, which started to appear the same year, Joan Littlewood was responsible for what she called ''the destruction of complacent, well-behaved middle-class theater.''         She demonstrated to the British that lively work could be produced on a shoestring, that tight-knit ensembles were likely to produce better work than ad hoc casts, and that performers and dramatists did not need to suppress their working-class identities in order to succeed.         ''Theater should be grand, vulgar, simple, pathetic,'' Ms. Littlewood said, but ''not genteel, not poetical.''         It was her exuberant energy and feisty informality that once provoked Laurence Olivier to remark ruefully: ''I wish I could work that way. But I'm a trained parrot.''         Joan Maud Littlewood was born in London in 1914, the daughter of a 16-year-old unmarried housemaid. School trips to the Old Vic, and in particular to John Gielgud's performance as Hamlet, bred in her a love of the theater and she won a coveted scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. But she was very much the Cockney outsider in a school she later described as being full of ''debs and rich Americans acquiring English accents.'' She dropped out and made her way, mostly on foot, to the northern city of Manchester, where she got a job in a local repertory theater.         She quickly decided, however, that ''curtain theater'' was not for her. An instinctive radicalism, combined with habitual restlessness, impelled her toward theater work in which, as she later wrote, everything was created by the actors on a bare platform: ''tempest, sun and rain, rivers, storm-tossed seas.''         With Jimmy Miller, who wrote plays under the name of Ewan McColl and was to become her husband, she formed an agitprop group in Manchester called Theater of Action and then created a company called Theater Union, which introduced the British to the American concept called the Living Newspaper, improvisations based on the day's news. After the war this evolved into Theater Workshop, which toured with plays of social or political significance both in Britain and on the Continent.         The company's reputation grew, but its finances remained shaky, provoking George Bernard Shaw to tell Ms. Littlewood that her company ''should all go and be stockbrokers -- the English don't want art.'' The actors paid for one tour by picking tomatoes in the country and selling them at a profit in Manchester.         Tiring of squalid surroundings, Ms. Littlewood decided in 1953 to settle her players in the Theater Royal, a dilapidated Victorian playhouse in the area of London described in Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' as Stratford-atte-Bowe, but now simply known as Stratford East. This caused a permanent breach with Mr. Miller, who feared the move to London would compromise the company's radicalism, and was itself financially risky.         For many months the actors slept in hammocks in the auditorium, shared what little box-office income there was and seldom earned more than $3 a week each. For this they were also expected to paint, decorate and clean the theater as well as perform.         Even in the 1960's, when the theater was internationally renowned, Ms. Littlewood herself was to be found washing the steps before opening nights, reportedly snapping at one passing actor, ''I'm expecting company -- what about you?'' That hospitality and lack of pretension found its way into productions that combined simple staging and dramatic gusto with a determination to break down the conventional barriers between actors and audiences.         Spectators might find themselves directly addressed by characters. There was so much good-natured improvisation that the company was prosecuted for breaching censorship laws, which remained in force in Britain until 1968. Evenings would often end with cheerful gatherings in the theater bar, maybe with Behan or another maverick orchestrating the fun.         Ms. Littlewood met Behan after his incongruously exuberant attack on capital punishment, ''The Quare Fellow'' landed in an inky, tattered bundle on her desk in 1956. She helped him radically revise it, transferred it from Stratford to the West End and so thoroughly took control of his career that he once described himself as ''a creature of Joan's imagination.''         She said she was on the floor, holding Behan's legs to his chair, while he gave a notoriously incoherent, drunken interview in the BBC studios. She also calmed the police when they brought him to the Theater Royal after finding him at the wheel of a ferry on the Thames, saying he was crossing the Missouri. Later she took Behan's Irish Republican Army play, ''The Hostage,'' to the West End and on to New York. But she was unable to stem the drinking that was to kill him in 1964 while he was working on his final piece for the Theater Royal, ''Richard's Cork Leg.''         Among the other plays Ms. Littlewood edited into dramatic shape was ''A Taste of Honey,'' about a white Lancashire girl who becomes pregnant after an affair with a black sailor. The manuscript was sent to her by the teenage Shelagh Delaney with this note: ''I am sending this play to you for your opinion. Would you please return it to me, as whatever sort of theatrical atrocity it is to you it means something to me.''         Ms. Littlewood put the play into rehearsal within two weeks, and it had its first performance at the Theater Royal in May 1958. It went on to the West End and Broadway, providing personal triumphs for Joan Plowright, who played the girl onstage, and Rita Tushingham, who played her in Tony Richardson's 1961 film.         The improvised ''Oh What A Lovely War,'' which brought Theater Workshop its greatest success, was a satire of World War I done in 1963 as a music hall revue with the actors in black-and-white commedia dell'arte costumes. It was later staged on Broadway and made into an all-star film in 1969 by Richard Attenborough. ''Oh What a Lovely War'' used war records, memoirs, speeches and the beloved songs of the Great War -- among them ''Pack Up Your Troubles,'' ''It's a Long Way to Tipperary,'' and ''Keep the Home Fires Burning'' -- to, as Ms. Littlewood put it, ''mock the absurdity, the vulgarity of war.''         She also gave William Saroyan's ''Sam, the Highest Jumper of Them All'' its world premiere, enjoyed success with Wolf Mankowitz's ''Make Me an Offer'' and the ex-convict Frank Norman's ''Fings Ain't What They Used to Be,'' and discovered talent that ranged from John Bury, later the National Theater's head of design, to Richard Harris, who played Macbeth for her.         Though she was best known for staging new work, she directed many classic plays, usually in a rough style that emphasized their immediacy and topicality.         ''If I have to choose between the gods and the clowns, I'll take the clowns,'' Ms. Littlewood once said. ''They're close to the commedia dell'arte and that's what I'm trying to get close to. There's so much nonsense about theater being this or that. Who needs a National Theater? We've already got enough museums.'' She continued: ''My idea is to open doors, to create a community, a meeting place. My doors are open to anyone, to any prostitute or gangster.''         In ''Joan's Book,'' her autobiography, published in 1994, she described herself as ''plain, moody, often amusing sometimes.'' She was known for being tough, combative, ribald and generous. In the words of Philip Hedley, the current director of the Theater Royal, she ''loved conflict, enjoyed provoking, and could demolish people -- and then make them a meal in the green room.''         Though she never married Gerry Raffles, Theater Workshop's general manager, he became her partner and the most significant person in her life. After his death in 1975 she left London for France, where she lived as a recluse. That ended her much-publicized plan to build a ''fun palace'' in East London where people from backgrounds like her own might join in cultural activities of every kind.         She left no immediate survivors. As experimental theater groups sprung up all over London and all around the world, she once said, as The Guardian reported in its obituary: ''I didn't need to have children. All over the world I have children.''       
         Stephanie Reinhart, an innovative arts administrator who had an international impact in promoting new trends in contemporary dance as co-director of the American Dance Festival and as co-artistic director for dance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 58 and lived in Durham, N.C., and Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her husband, Charles L. Reinhart, said.         Ms. Reinhart usually worked in tandem with her husband, who became the festival's director in 1969 after a pioneering career, begun in the 1950's, in producing and managing modern dance companies as well as developing dance projects for the National Endowment for the Arts and State Department cultural exchange programs.         The Reinharts' joint activities included the highly praised Balanchine Festival two years ago at the Kennedy Center and ''Free to Dance,'' a documentary film for public television about black dance for which the Reinharts just won an Emmy Award as its executive producers. They commissioned many works by both novice and veteran choreographers, including Paul Taylor and Merce Cunningham.         Ms. Reinhart was a staff member at the National Endowment for the Arts in its early years and joined the American Dance Festival in 1977. When Martha Clarke, the choreographer and director, left Pilobolus Dance Theater in the early 1980's to form her own dance company, Crows Nest, Ms. Reinhart served as her manager, consultant and fund-raiser. With her sharp analytic eye and her tireless support of original talent, Ms. Reinhart was also president of the board of directors of Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians.         Ms. Reinhart placed equally consistent emphasis on preserving the traditions of modern dance. She established a national touring program for the Dayton Contemporary Dance Theater's revivals of rarely performed classics by black choreographers.         Ms. Reinhart and her husband, who married in 1977, were indefatigable in seeking out new choreographers from abroad. They were the first to introduce Butoh, the experimental Japanese genre with apocalyptic themes, to the United States. Together they braved a windy outdoor performance on a cold mountain top in Japan to see Dai Rakuda Kan, the Butoh group they presented at the American Dance Festival's home at Duke University in 1982.         The Reinharts also presented the Japanese-born neo-Butoh performers Eiko and Koma. ''Stephanie was very personal and encouraged us artists to be personal as well,'' this avant-garde duo said in a statement on Monday. ''We know there are many dance artists in the world who were as encouraged as we were by her quiet enthusiasm. Stephanie strongly believed what dance can deliver. Her belief made all of us, coming from different countries and different cultures, into one family.''         Similarly, the Reinharts were the first to familiarize Americans with the nascent French contemporary dance boom after they traveled to France to select five troupes for the festival in 1983, and Ms. Reinhart was awarded the medal of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters this month for her contributions to furthering dance in France and throughout the world.         Ms. Reinhart frequently visited Europe and Latin America to see choreographers unfamiliar in the United States. The Reinharts' often-stated belief was that modern dance was a prime indigenous American art form that spread worldwide in the last three decades.         Convinced that young dancers abroad were interested in studying the idioms of modern dance, they organized workshops in Japan, South Korea and Russia. They also helped establish the Guangdong Modern Dance Company, China's first modern dance troupe.         Unlike her husband, Ms. Reinhart did not begin her career specifically in dance but in broader area of arts administration. Born in Washington, she graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin in 1966. She received a fellowship for graduate work in American literary and cultural history at George Washington University and attended the Harvard University Summer Institute in Arts Administration in 1974.         After the National Endowment for the Arts was established in 1965, Ms. Reinhart became part of the first generation of professionally trained arts administrators. She joined the Endowment in 1969 and was program administrator for its Dance and Education Programs, also working in the planning and development of the Artists-in-Schools Program.         In 1996 the Reinharts were named Artistic Directors for Dance at the Kennedy Center. They inaugurated an energetic and innovative commissioning program for collaborations by jazz composers and modern dance companies with funds from the Doris Duke Charitable Trust.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Reinhart is survived by her daughter, Ariane M. Reinhart of New York; her mother, Florence Keren of Washington; and three stepsons, Taylor, of Los Angeles; Adam, of Honolulu; and Scott, of Geneseo, N.Y.       
         LaWanda Page, the acid-tongued comedienne who, as the cantankerous Aunt Esther, traded barbs with Redd Foxx on the 1970's sitcom ''Sanford and Son,'' died on Saturday in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was complications of diabetes, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Page was a veteran of the black circuit of theaters and nightclubs. She began as a dancer, added a fire-swallowing bit (billed as the ''Bronze Goddess of Fire'') and moved gradually into skit and stand-up comedy on the so-called Midwestern ''chitlin circuit.'' Most of those clubs, she later said, were dumps, the kind of places ''where if you ain't home by 9 o'clock you can be declared legally dead.''         Her big break came when she was tapped for a supporting role in the second season of Norman Lear's ''Sanford and Son,'' which starred Foxx, a friend from comedy club days, as Fred Sanford, an eccentric and irascible junk dealer in the Watts section of Los Angeles. As the ungainly, wisecracking, Bible-toting sister of Sanford's late wife, Elizabeth, she quickly became one of the show's most popular characters.         Her character, Aunt Esther, took her share of zingers from Foxx and other cast members -- Sanford's friend Grady once quipped, ''Nice having her around, she makes the junk look so pretty.'' But Aunt Esther usually responded with equally stinging rejoinders. ''Watch it, sucker!'' her favorite catch phrase, was followed by a spate of sharp-tongued invective. The exchanges between her and Sanford were among the weekly highlights. ''Sanford and Son,'' ran from 1972 to 1977 on NBC and remained one of television's top rated shows, inspiring several spinoffs in which she also appeared.         Ms. Page was born in Cleveland on Oct. 19, 1920, and began her dancing career at age 15. After years on the club circuit with comedians like Foxx and Richard Pryor, Ms. Page moved to Los Angeles in the 1960's and joined the comedy group Skillet, Leroy & Co. She soon developed and honed her trademark feisty comic approach -- more shrill but still reminiscent of Moms Mabley's homespun wit. (''Honey, that old man couldn't keep no kinda job. That's the only man I know that ever went to the unemployment office and lost his place in line.'')         She is survived by a daughter, Clara Johnson, of Los Angeles.         Throughout the 1970's and 80's, Ms. Page played cameo roles in a few feature films and made guest appearances on talk shows and sitcoms. Offstage, she was an advocate for equal opportunities and better pay for black performers.       
         Catherine Connelly, who as an 11-year-old in 1904 escaped the inferno that burned the General Slocum, an excursion boat in the East River, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Wilton, Conn. She was 109 and was one of the last two survivors of the disaster, according to a commemorative group.         Maureen Enright, Mrs. Connelly's granddaughter, reported the death. Kenneth Leib, president of the General Slocum Memorial Association, said that only one General Slocum survivor remains alive: Adella Wotherspoon, 98, a retired teacher in Watchung, N.J.         ''I'm sorry, of course,'' Mrs. Wotherspoon said in a phone interview. ''She had a very long life. She was a very interesting person.''         Mrs. Connelly treasured her family more than anything, and she is survived by her two daughters Jeanne Meehan of Goshen, N.Y., and Elizabeth Reilly of Greenwich, Conn.; 27 grandchildren; 30 great-grandchildren; and 7 great-great-grandchildren.         She had all but one of her 11 babies at home, and made her own diapers. Mother's Days meant wall-to-wall flowers in the Manhattan apartment where she lived alone until she was 102. Her pleasures included cooking rich food, and her secret for longevity was a banana a day.         But every year in the weeks leading up to June 15, the anniversary of the disaster -- New York City's most lethal fire until Sept. 11, 2001 -- she would become sad. She remembered the boy shouting ''fire'' over a brass band, mothers and children with clothing on fire leaping into the swirling whirlpools of Hell Gate in the East River, dresses shredded in machinery. When it was all over, 1,021 of the 1,331 passengers on the Sunday School cruise on a sunny day were dead.         ''Sometimes he's very cruel, the man upstairs,'' Mrs. Connelly said in an interview with The New York Times in 1989.         Catherine Uhlmyer was born in Manhattan on April 4, 1893. Her father died before she was a year old, and her mother married John Gallagher. His last name became hers.         She grew up in what was known as Little Germany, an enclave between Houston and 14th Streets on the East Side. Pickles were a penny each, and stacks of rye bread with apple butter were the delicacy of the day. St. Mark's Lutheran Church on East Sixth Street was the place of worship for much of the community.         The church chartered the General Slocum, a wooden sidewheel steamboat, for the outing. A grocer who belonged to the church gave the Gallaghers, who were Roman Catholics, three tickets. But they needed one more. Mr. Gallagher had to work.         ''I went over to the store crying and they gave me a ticket,'' Mrs. Connelly said. ''I was never on a boat before.''         Nor did she ever set foot on one again.         The passengers boarded at 9:40 a.m. for the trip to Long Island for a picnic. After catching fire at Hell Gate, the General Slocum put ashore on North Brother Island at 10:40 and burned. Catherine Gallagher was rescued by a tugboat.         An investigation revealed that life jackets and fire hoses had fallen apart with age; lifeboats were wired in place; and the crew had never conducted a fire drill. Only the ship's captain went to prison.         In the days after the disaster, Little Germany's doorways were draped in black, and on June 18, 1904, the neighborhood saw 156 funerals. More than 600 households lost loved ones. Mrs. Connelly lost her mother, brother and sister. Mrs. Wotherspoon lost two sisters, two cousins and two aunts.         Catherine Gallagher first lived with her grandparents, then with an aunt and uncle. She dropped out of school at 13, and at 20 she married Thomas Connelly, a truck driver.         In Mrs. Connelly's later years, she was interviewed for many articles and television documentaries on the General Slocum, but she never lost her perspective.         ''You know,'' she said in the interview with The Times, ''you don't fully grasp the meaning of everything.''       
         Eileen Jackson Southern, a scholar of Renaissance and African-American music and the first black woman to be appointed a tenured full professor at Harvard University, died on Sunday at her home in Port Charlotte, Fla. She was 82.         As a researcher, author and teacher, Dr. Southern documented the history and scope of African-American contributions to American music. Much of her work remains in print.         ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'' (1971) is in its third edition (Norton, 1997). She also compiled the ''Biographical Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians'' (Greenwood, 1982) and ''The Music of Black Americans'' (Norton, third edition, 1997).         In 1973, with her husband, Prof. Joseph Southern, she founded Black Perspectives in Music, the first musicological journal on the study of black music. She edited the journal until it ceased publication in 1990.         She received a National Humanities Medal in 2001 for having ''helped transform the study and understanding of American music.'' She also received the 2000 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society of American Music.         In a way, Eileen Southern's mission was prompted by a question she encountered while teaching at CUNY's York College in 1968. At issue was the inclusion of music in a black-studies curriculum. She recalled that a colleague asked, ''Besides jazz, what is there?''         Her life's work was meant to give an answer.         She traced the evolution of black choruses from church singing groups, and a startling number of black orchestras like the Negro Philharmonic Society of New Orleans. In the early 1900's, black and white audiences flocked to Carnegie Hall to hear the Clef Club Symphony Orchestra under its conductor James Reese Europe play music by black composers like Harry T. Burleigh and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.         Eileen Jackson was born in Minneapolis and grew up in Chicago. Encouraged by her parents, whose home was a haven for black musicians, she studied piano and made her first concert appearance at age 7. She continued to give concerts on tour while pursuing her academic career and musicological studies until the mid-1950's.         She graduated in 1940 from the University of Chicago, where she received a master's degree the next year. Her thesis was ''The Use of Negro Folksong in Symphonic Form.'' Faced with racial discrimination, she started teaching at traditionally black colleges in Texas and Louisiana.         Moving to New York in 1954, she taught public school before joining the CUNY faculty of Brooklyn College in 1960. She became a full professor in 1972 at York College, where she also served as chairwoman of the music department.         In the 1950's she studied at New York University under the Renaissance music scholar Gustave Reese. She received her Ph.D. in 1961 with a dissertation about Renaissance music. It was published as ''The Buxheim Organ Book'' (Institute of Mediaeval Music, 1963).         Dr. Southern went to Harvard as a lecturer in 1974 and received a dual appointment in Afro-American studies and music in 1976. She headed the department of Afro-American studies from 1975 to 1979 and retired in 1987 as a professor emeritus.         She is survived by her husband of 60 years, Professor Southern; a daughter, April S. Reilly of Florence, Calif.; a son, Edward J., of Port Charlotte; a sister, Stella Hall of Chicago; and three grandchildren.         She was the editor of ''African American Theater: 'Out of Bondage' (1876), and 'Peculiar Sam: or The Underground Railroad' (1879)'' (Garland, 1994). She also wrote, with Dr. Josephine Wright, ''Images: Iconography of Music and Musicians in African-American Culture'' (Garland, 1998). Both are in print.         Dr. Southern remembered her reception at Harvard as far from cordial. In ''A Pioneer,'' an essay she contributed to the 1993 anthology ''Blacks at Harvard,'' she told of years of stress spent gaining respect for herself and the fledgling department she headed.         But she invoked her role model, W. E. B. Du Bois. ''Like him, I went to Harvard because it was a great opportunity for me as a black female scholar, and I accepted the reality of racial and sex discrimination,'' she wrote. ''In its role as nurturer of scholars, Harvard never let me down!''       
         Aileen Riggin Soule, a diver and swimmer who at age 14 became the youngest American Olympic gold medalist and later became the oldest living American female gold medalist, died Thursday in a nursing home in Honolulu. She was 96.         At the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, Riggin won the first gold medal awarded in women's springboard diving and became, at 4 feet 7 inches and 65 pounds, the smallest American Olympic champion. In the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, she became the only woman to win medals in swimming and diving in the same Olympics, taking the silver medal in springboard diving and the bronze medal in the 100-meter backstroke.         In 1974, in one of the many articles she wrote on her career, she said:         ''My most unforgettable experience would have to be as the youngest member of the first American women's Olympic swimming and diving team in 1920. I was a very small 14-year-old. Until two months before the tryouts, we had no idea of the dives required, and some were entirely new. Lacking precedent, we learned as we went along, yet practice was uncertain as the boards were not standardized.         ''When the book of rules arrived, it was in French and sent us to the dictionary to discover what a 'coup de pied à la lune' was. It turned out to be a gainer [a dive now known as a reverse]. There were also 12 dives instead of the usual 10, two of which to be drawn from a hat just before the contest.''         Last-minute preparation was the story of her career. She was born May 2, 1906, in Newport, R.I., and reared in New York City. Her father was a Navy paymaster, and she traveled extensively with her parents.         She learned to swim at age 6, in Manila Bay. In 1918, she came down with influenza during the epidemic that swept the United States during World War I. On her doctor's recommendation that she swim for her health, she joined the celebrated Women's Swimming Association team in New York.         In 1919, when she took up diving, there were no indoor pools with diving boards available to women. Many people thought women should not dive at all because it would injure their health.         The only place to practice in the metropolitan New York area was a tidal pool on Long Island, an hour from the city. When the tide rose, the board was about 10 feet above the surface, about the height of a 3-meter springboard. When the tide was out, the drop was 14 feet, so the divers tried to time their practices for high tide in warm weather on weekends.         Even with those poor training conditions, Riggin finished second in the United States Olympic trials behind Helen Wainwright, who was also 14. But until the day before the boat sailed for Antwerp, they were not sure they would be able to compete in the Olympics because many officials did not want women, much less two 14-year-olds. But because Riggin and Wainwright had also made the Olympic team as swimmers, they went.         For 13 days, they sailed on a battered military transport ship, where training was a nightmare. Riggin recalled: ''I remember the javelin throwers could tie a rope around their javelin, throw them out to sea and pull them back. The shooters used clay pigeons until they ran out. After a while, the sea gulls were looking pretty good.''         In a tiny canvas tank filled with seawater, the swimmers, one at a time, swam 5 to 10 minutes, held in place by a belt around the waist. Divers could not train at all.''         In Antwerp, a city still recovering from World War I, the swimmers and divers competed in a moat-like canal. Ethelda Bleibtrey, the American who won gold medals in all three women's races, told King Albert I of Belgium, ''I swam in mud, not water.''         The diving board was a plank with no spring, and, Riggin said, ''the water was black and icy cold.'' Without a coach there, the American women swept the medals, with Wainwright winning the silver and Thelma Payne the bronze. After that, American women won every gold medal in Olympic springboard diving until 1960.         In 1924, Riggin was an Olympian again, joining American teammates like Johnny Weissmuller, who later gained fame playing Tarzan, and a Yale rower named Benjamin Spock.         ''Being 18 and being in Paris was wonderful,'' she said. ''The sun was shining, we read Hemingway and we were just carried away.''         She was in the first underwater swimming film in 1922 and the first slow-motion swimming and diving films in 1923. She turned professional in 1925, giving diving exhibitions and swimming demonstrations in England and Wales.         In 1926, she played three weeks at the Hippodrome in New York, diving into a glass tank, into six feet of water. After her former swimming teammate Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel, Riggin and Ederle toured for six months. In 1937, at the Cleveland Exposition, Riggin helped organize and star in the first Billy Rose Aquacade.         She toured the world, appeared in movies and wrote a sports column for The New York Evening Post and articles for national magazines. In 1967, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. She never stopped swimming or lecturing or writing about it, and at 85 she broke six world records for her age group in the world masters championships.         She and her husband, Howard Soule, who died several years ago, moved to Hawaii in 1957 and lived in a Diamond Head apartment in Honolulu. Even into her 90's, she swam three miles a week in the ocean.         She is survived by a daughter, Yvonne May of Zurich; a stepdaughter, Patti Anderson of Honolulu; and two stepsons, Bruce Soule of Newport Beach, Calif., and Wallace Soule of Bakersfield, Calif.         In 1996, when asked if she had any goals in addition to attending the Atlanta Olympics, she replied: ''Yes. I'd like to continue -- life in general, that is.''       
         Dr. Jeanne L. Noble, a professor of education who in 1962 became one of the first African-American women to receive tenure at New York University, died on Oct. 17 at New York University Medical Center. She was 76.         She had congestive heart failure, a friend, Paula Giddings, said.         Dr. Noble, who received her undergraduate degree from Howard University and a doctorate in education from Columbia University, joined the N.Y.U. faculty in 1959.         At the time of her death, she was professor emeritus at the City University of New York's Graduate Center and at Brooklyn College.         In 1963, she joined efforts to desegregate her hometown, Albany, Ga., as national president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.         In 1964, she was chosen by President Johnson to help plan the Women's Job Corps, a component of his national plan to fight poverty.         Later, she was appointed by Presidents Nixon and Ford to serve on national educational commissions.         Dr. Noble wrote ''The Negro Woman as College Graduate,'' published in 1956, and a history of African-American women, ''Beautiful, Also, Are the Souls of My Black Sisters,'' published in 1978.         In 1970, she won a regional Emmy Award for writing and moderating the CBS television program ''The Learning Experience.''         Jeanne Laveta Noble was born on July 18, 1926. She is survived by two brothers, John, of St. Louis, and William, of Albany, Ga.       
         Hadda Brooks, the smoky-voiced torch singer and pianist who was known in the 1940's as the Queen of the Boogie and came out of retirement in the late 1980's to gain new popularity with younger audiences, died on Thursday at 86.         She died at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, a few weeks after undergoing open-heart surgery, said Russ Paul, her manager.         Trained as a classical pianist, Ms. Brooks began recording boogie-woogie instrumentals in 1945 for Modern Records, which soon became the West Coast's premier rhythm-and-blues label. In the late 1940's and 50's she scored a number or hits as a torch singer, including ''That's My Desire,'' ''Trust in Me'' and ''Dream.''         She played singers in several films, and won a role singing to Humphrey Bogart in the film ''Out of the Blue'' after beating Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan in auditions. She toured with the Harlem Globetrotters, and in 1951 became the first black woman in the country to host her own television variety show.         Born Hadda Hapgood in Los Angeles in 1916, she begged her father for piano lessons at the age of 4, and stretched her tiny hands on a board for a week until they could reach across an octave.         She started out playing at rehearsals for a tap dance coach, Willie Covan, with clients like Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell, Gene Kelly and Shirley Temple. Mr. Covan was friendly with the Globetrotters' players and in 1941 Ms. Brooks married another basketball player, Earl Morrison. He died a year later of pneumonia at 21.         Early on in her career, she became close friends with Billie Holiday, whom she met in a nightclub ladies' room when Ms. Holiday reportedly opened the door to her stall and offered Ms. Brooks a puff on her marijuana cigarette.         Ms. Brooks's big break came when a jukebox repairman named Jules Bihari overheard her playing a piano in a Los Angeles record store in the mid-1940's. He said he had only $800, but if she would work up a boogie in two weeks he would record it. She did, and the result, ''Swinging the Boogie,'' became her first hit, in 1945.         In the 1950's, she drifted into obscurity, singing and playing in Europe, Hawaii and Australia, and in 1971 she retired.         But in 1987 she sang at a supper club in Los Angeles and drew rave reviews. By the mid-1990's, she had been discovered by the younger generation, and was playing in the actor Johnny Depp's Viper Room in Los Angeles, along with quieter locales like the Oak Room of New York's Algonquin Hotel.         ''Her voice, velvety and drenched with an after-hours smokiness, is familiar with deep emotions,'' wrote the critic Peter Watrous in The New York Times in 1989.         In 1993, the Rhythm and Blues Foundation gave her its Prestigious Pioneer Award in a ceremony at the Hollywood Palace.         In 1995, she recorded a new CD titled ''Time Was When'' for Virgin/Pointblank Records, which has also issued a new 50-year retrospective of her work, ''I've Got News for You.''         Ms. Brooks is survived by a sister, Kathryn Carter, and two nephews, Kent and Darryl Carter.         ''I try not to put anything new into my songs,'' she told an interviewer in 1989. ''I go back 20 years to find me.''         Correction:  November 26, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary of the singer and pianist Hadda Brooks in some copies on Sunday misidentified the film in which she sang to Humphrey Bogart. It was ''In a Lonely Place,'' not ''Out of the Blue.''       
         Vinnette Carroll, the trailblazing actress, director and playwright who was the first African-American woman to direct a production on Broadway, died Tuesday at her home in Fort Lauderhill, Fla. She was 80.         The cause was complications from diabetes and heart disease, said Anita MacShane, a friend.         A black woman in a business often dominated by white men, Ms. Carroll's career included several theatrical milestones and a consistent sense of activity and ambition.         As a director, she was not only the first black woman to direct on Broadway -- the musical revue ''Don't Bother Me I Can't Cope,'' in 1972 -- but she also brought her best-known show, the gospel-infused ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' to Broadway on three separate occasions. As an actress, Ms. Carroll won an Emmy (''Beyond the Blues,'' in 1964), an Obie (''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl,'' in 1962) and was nominated for three Tony awards.         Ms. Carroll was also the founder and artistic director of the Urban Arts Corps, a New York-based training and producing organization devoted to supporting black and Hispanic theater and actors. The group fostered the careers of hundreds of performers, including Cicely Tyson and Sherman Hemsley, as well as presenting ''Don't Bother Me'' and ''Your Arms Too Short.'' The onetime director of the New York State Ghetto Arts Program, which brought theater and dance to poor neighborhoods, Ms. Carroll also worked in Los Angeles at the Inner City Repertory in the Watts district, presenting classical and modern works.         Born into a well-off Jamaican family, Ms. Carroll moved to Harlem when she was 10 and found an instant affinity for the arts, playing viola with the Dean Dixon Symphony when in high school. Her father, however, who was a dentist, had medical plans for her. After graduating from Long Island University, Ms. Carroll received a master's degree in psychology from New York University and worked briefly as a clinical psychologist in the New York City schools.         At the same time, though, she was moonlighting in acting classes; drama soon won her over. In 1948, she was accepted to the Erwin Pescator dramatic workshop at the New School, where she studied with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.         A tall woman with with round cheeks and a high brow, Ms. Carroll was not classified as beautiful in the traditional sense, but still she impressed her teachers with her expressive eyes and resonant voice.         After honing her craft by acting at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., Ms. Carroll found some work in the theater in the 1950's, and also toured extensively with a one-woman show that she wrote. Her Broadway debut came in a short-lived revival of ''A Small War on Murray Hill,'' open for a single week in January 1957.         It was during the 1960's and 70's, the height the national black theater movement, that Ms. Carroll's talents came into full bloom.         In 1962, she won her Obie in ''Moon Over a Rainbow Shawl'' Off Broadway, stealing scenes from her castmate James Earl Jones. A year later, ''Trumpets of the Lord,'' Ms. Carroll's musical adaptation of seven sermons, became a runaway Off Broadway hit. In 1964, she won her Emmy. In 1966, she garnered more praise for directing and starring in the Langston Hughes play ''Prodigal Son,'' a production that toured Europe.         In 1967, she founded the Urban Arts Corps, which produced dozens of shows out of a space on West 20th Street. In 1969, another production of ''Trumpets of the Lord'' opened on Broadway, but closed in less than a week.         Ms. Carroll more than made up for the brevity of that run with two enormous success during the 1970's. The first was ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' a roof-raising gospel revue with songs by Micki Grant, which Ms. Carroll conceived, produced and directed at the Urban Arts Corps in 1970 and later took to Broadway, where it ran for 1,065 performances. Ms. Carroll's direction was nominated for a Tony, making her the first black woman ever to win that nomination. (She lost to Bob Fosse for ''Pippin.'')         Shortly after ''I Can't Cope'' closed, in 1974, Ms. Carroll began conceiving a followup, a gospel celebration of the Gospel of St. Matthew. That show, ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' with music and lyrics by Alex Bradford and Micki Grant, turned out to be a big success, spawning several national tours and two return trips to Broadway, including a 1982 version starred Patti LaBelle and Al Green. A fourth trip to Broadway is being planned for next year.         Not all of Ms. Carroll's efforts were as successful. A pricey adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' titled ''But Never Jam Today,'' had a tortured route to Broadway, only to close within a week, in 1979.         Ms. Carroll divided her time between New York and Florida, where she bought a house in the 1980's. She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Carroll Hudgins, of Manhattan.         In the late 1980's, she founded a theater in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., devoted to featuring work by minority playwrights and actors. Throughout her life, Ms. Carroll was an eloquent speaker about the challenges of being black and female.         ''I have had a great deal of hurt in the theater both as a Negro and as a woman, but I don't get immobilized by it,'' she said an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1967. ''I tell myself that no one individual is going to make it impossible for me.''       
         Margaret Taylor Hancock, whose many-hued family tree sprang to life in a book by her daughter that became a meditation on the meaning of race in America, died on Tuesday in Branford, Conn. She was 90 and lived in North Haven.         Mrs. Hancock was the product of a multiracial, multi-ethnic family and grew up black. Her siblings, from whom she was separated at age 4, grew up white. In 1994, Simon & Schuster published ''The Sweeter the Juice: A Family Memoir in Black and White,'' a portrait of life in the black bourgeoisie drawn by her daughter, Shirlee Taylor Haizlip.         Mrs. Hancock, born Margaret Morris in Washington and trained as a teacher, married a black minister and became a dedicated ''voluntary Negro.'' Her siblings went through life in white society, and it was not until 76 years later, in 1992, that she was reunited with a sister.         Her daughter, Mrs. Haizlip, used all means, from private eyes to public records, to trace their many strands of ancestry and relate their stories. There was, for instance, the great-grandmother who voyaged from Ireland to escape the potato famine and married a half-black slave.         He had learned to play the piccolo from his Scottish father, and, having fled from Virginia, played it in a Union Army band during the Civil War. There were African, American Indian, English and possibly Italian forebears, all with stories to tell.         In the 1900 census, Margaret Morris's family was classified as mulatto; it split only later into white and black branches. Young Margaret attended Miner's Teachers' College in Washington and, in 1933, married the Rev. Julian A. Taylor, son of a prominent Washington clergyman.         She was a co-founder of the N.A.A.C.P. branch in Ansonia, Conn., where her husband was a Baptist minister, and became active in the state's foster care system. She personally fostered six girls and found places for many others.         Mr. Taylor died in 1981. In 1987 she married Graham Hancock of New Haven, who died in 1993. She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Haizlip of Los Angeles; Dr. Jewelle Taylor Gibbs of Palo Alto, Calif.; and Patricia Taylor Brown of North Haven; 12 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.         When she reunited with her older sister, Grace Morris Cramer of Anaheim, Calif., after 76 years, they had ''six good years together,'' commuting coast to coast, Mrs. Haizlip said yesterday. Mrs. Cramer died in 1998.
