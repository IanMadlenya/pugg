         Chloethiel Woodard Smith, a Washington architect who worked on the urban renewal of Southwest Washington and the creation of the new town of Reston, Va., in the 1960's, died on Wednesday at her home in Washington. She was 82.         She died of cancer, said Sydney Kasper, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Smith had a variety of projects in Washington and in Syracuse and Rochester, N.Y. She handled both housing and commercial projects and was one of the first women to become well known in American architecture. She retired about five years ago.         She was born in Peoria, Ill., and graduated from the University of Oregon. She earned her master's degree at Washington University in St. Louis.         Mrs. Smith was the widow of Bromley K. Smith, who was a consultant to the National Security Council for many years. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a son, Bromley Smith Jr. of Kenya, and a daughter, Suzanne Arias of Madrid.       
         Josephine T. Moran, a former Westchester resident who was active in many civic organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Boulder, Colo. She was 90.         She died of emphysema, said a son, Charles Moran 3d of Pelham, Mass.         Mrs. Moran was born in Manhattan and attended the Nightingale Bamford School and Smith College. From 1945 to 1975 she was involved in a range of volunteer activities in Westchester County and Connecticut.         They included the Children's Association, the Westchester County public schools, Grasslands Hospital, and the Rhodes Home in Westchester County, the Heritage Village Library, in Southport, Conn., and the Hitchcock Center, in Amherst, Mass.         Mrs. Moran's husband, Charles Moran Jr., died in 1978.         Besides her son Charles , she is survived by another son, David, of Boulder; a sister, Eva Taylor Holt of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         Correction:  January 19, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary on Friday about Josephine T. Moran, a former Westchester resident who died on Wednesday in Boulder, Colo., misstated her age. She was 81.       
         Annapaola Cancogni, a teacher, writer and translator of French and Italian works into English, died on Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 48 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Anne F. Garetta, her companion.         Dr. Cancogni taught at Harvard and at Queens College in New York and in the Paris program of the University of California at Berkeley.         Her translations included Umberto Eco's "Open Work and Other Essays" (1989), Annie Cohen-Solal's "Sartre" (1987), Raymond Radiguet's "Count d'Orgel's Ball" (1989), Francesca Duranti's "Happy Ending" (1990) and Annette Kahn's "Why My Father Died: The Trial of Klaus Barbie" (1991).         She wrote culture and travel articles for Italian newspapers and magazines and book reviews for The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune.         Dr. Cancogni was born in Florence, Italy, and grew up in Tuscany, France and England. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in comparative literature from Harvard in 1979.         In addition to her companion, she is survived by a son, Lance R. Mankowski of Brooklyn; her parents, Manlio and Maria Vittoria of Pietrasanta, Italy, and a sister, Alessandra Cappuccio of Florence.       
         Jeanne Sauve, a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada in the 1980's, died on Tuesday in Montreal. She was 70.         Her death was announced by the office of the Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II. It did not give the cause of death.         A former television journalist and freelance columnist, Mrs. Sauve entered politics in 1972 by winning election as a Member of Parliament from a district outside Montreal now known as Laval-les-Rapides.         After two years as a back-bencher, she was named as a junior minister in the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, overseeing science and technology and eventually the environment and communications. A Difficult Passage         But it was as Speaker, the keeper of the rules and traditions in the lower house, that Mrs. Sauve broke barriers and gained a national reputation.         When she was named to the post in 1980, she was still best known as part of a political elite that had congregated in Montreal in the 1950's to discuss art and politics and nationalism.         One participant was Mr. Trudeau, then a law professor and editor; another was Rene Levesque, a radio commentator who would later became a secessionist and Premier of Quebec, and a major adversary of Mr. Trudeau.         Her appointment drew criticism. Not only was she the first woman to preside over a forum that is still overwhelmingly male, but she was viewed by the Conservative opposition as lacking established ties to the House and knowledge of its often baroque procedures.         In her first two years, Mrs. Sauve was severely tested by strategists from the opposition who barraged her with points of order and privilege. But eventually even her adversaries paid tribute to her firmness and fairness, and she remained Speaker until 1984. Finally Won Respect         When Mr. Trudeau named her to the largely ceremonial but highly respected position of Governor General, she was also the first woman in that post, where she served until 1990.         Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit in Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, on April 26, 1922. She was educated at the University of Ottawa and University of Paris.         In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman who also served as a minister to Mr. Trudeau; he died last year. She is survived by a son, Jean-Francois.         Correction:  January 29, 1993, Friday         An obituary headline yesterday about a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada misidentified her. She was Jeanne Sauve.       
         Selma Rich Brody, an education consultant, died on Dec. 31 at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 66.         She died of cancer, her husband, Roy, said.         In 1965, Mrs. Brody was a founder of Miller Brody Productions, which produced educational audiovisual materials. She remained president of the business until 1979, when Random House acquired it.         While working on publicity for a center for the elderly in Mount Vernon in Westchester County in 1950, Mrs. Brody campaigned for discounts for the elderly on buses and at movie theaters. She became supervisor of activities for the elderly in Westchester in 1954. In 1958 she was a consultant on aging to Gov. W. Averell Harriman of New York.         She was born in New York City and graduated from Hunter College in 1946.         Also surviving are a daughter, Madeleine Krug of Burke, Va.; a son, Robert, of Northport, L.I.; a brother, Arnold Rich of Armonk, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Meredith Bowman Neuffer, 70, an artist who specialized in Oriental brush painting, died on Friday at her home in Weston, Conn.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Ms. Neuffer's works, featuring flowers and landscapes painted on silk with color ink washes, are held in private and public collections, including the Smithsonian Institution. They were were also shown in New York City and Washington as part of an exhibit by the Sumi-e Society, an international organization of Oriental brush painters.         Ms. Neuffer was born in Brockton, Mass., and graduated from Skidmore College in 1944. She worked as radio copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency and as the arts and crafts editor at American Home magazine, both in Manhattan.         Surviving are a son, Mark, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Elizabeth Neuffer, of Washington.       
         Joyce V. Nadelman, a former Foreign Service aide who was also active in Riverdale, the Bronx, died on Saturday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 75.         She died of heart failure, her husband said.         Mrs. Nadelman, formerly Joyce Cavanah, was born in Mount Vernon, Ind., and graduated from Boston University. She entered the Foreign Service in 1944 and was assigned to the United States Embassy in Warsaw. She also served at the American embassies in Lisbon, London, Prague and Paris.         She resigned in 1947 when she married E. Jan Nadelman, a career Foreign Service officer. They served together in diplomatic posts in Poland, Italy, Germany, and Liberia and at the State Department in Washington.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Philip J., and a daughter, Cynthia J., all of New York.       
         Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia, the widow of Peter II, whose reign as the last King of Yugoslavia was ended in 1941 by invading German troops, died Saturday at her home outside London. She was 71.         The Queen had been "very ill" with cancer for several years, said her daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Katherine.         Alexandra was born into Greek royalty -- and tragedy -- on March 25, 1921, five months after her father, Alexander, King of the Hellenes, died of blood poisoning after being bitten by a pet monkey.         Greece formally recognized her as a princess when she was 18 months old, but a year later she was in exile in England because of shifting Greek politics. She did not return to Greece until 13 years later, in 1935, when King George II, her uncle, returned to rule. Married Amid Royalty         When the Germans overran Greece in World War II, Alexandra and her mother, the former Aspasia Manos, the daughter of a royal equerry, again traveled to London. There she met King Peter II, who was studying at Cambridge after being swept from his throne. Both Alexandra and Peter were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.         She and Peter married on March 20, 1944, at the Yugoslav Legation in London, in the presence of three other monarchs in exile -- King George II of Greece, King Haakon of Norway and Queen Wilhemina of the Netherlands -- as well as King George VI of England, who was best man, and Queen Elizabeth, who is now the Queen Mother.         The next year, King Peter was formally deposed when Tito established a Communist Government in Yugoslavia. Peter's property was confiscated and the couple was soon virtually penniless. Peter died in Denver in 1970 after a liver transplant.         Their son, Crown Prince Alexander, who was born in Britain, traveled to Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, last summer as part of an effort to restore the family dynasty and to bring peace to the Balkans.         In addition to her son and daughter-in-law, Alexandra is survived by three grandchildren, Peter, Philip and Alexander.       
         Diana Brewster Clark, an educator and an authority on dyslexia, died at her home in Manhattan on Sunday. She was 56.         Her daughter, Elise S. Pettus of Manhattan, said the cause of death was uterine cancer.         Dr. Clark was recognized for her research on remedial education for dyslexia. Her book, "Dyslexia; Theory and Practice of Remedial Instruction" (York Press, 1988), is a standard text on the subject.         In the preface to this work, Dr. Clark writes that despite considerable knowledge acquired over the last 50 years about the nature of dyslexia, a perception disorder that confuses images, it may be a long time before effective treatment is widely available. Instructional Methods         Noting that remedial practice "cannot afford to wait" for research, she presents a comprehensive study of existing instructional methods and programs for dyslexic students.         At the time of her death, Dr. Clark was an adjunct professor of education at Columbia University Teachers College and an active member of the Columbia Teachers College Alumni Council, of which she was moderator in 1988 and 1989. She was also a trustee of the New York City School Volunteers and a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society, the national advocacy group.         Dr. Clark, who was born in Manhattan, attended Vassar College and graduated from Barnard College in 1959. She received a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia in 1984. Taught at Marymount         As a learning disabilities specialist, Dr. Clark taught the teaching of reading to children and young adults at the Nightingale-Bamford School and at the Communications and Learning Center of Marymount Manhattan College.         Her latest work was a chapter on early reading and instruction in the book, "Learning About Learning Disabilities" (Academic Press, 1991).         She was a board member of the Shaker Museum and the Columbia County Land Conservancy, both in Chatham, N.Y.         Two marriages, to Thomas W. Pettus and to James M. Clark, ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter Elise, Dr. Clark is survived by a daughter, Ashley S. Pettus, and a son, Brewster W. Pettus, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Whitney Armstrong and Janet York of Manhattan, and a brother, Benjamin Brewster, also of Manhattan.       
         Kate Wilkinson, an actress who appeared in the theater and on television, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was bone cancer, said her son, Jeffrey, of Brookline, Mass.         Mrs. Wilkinson appeared in many plays, both in New York and in regional theaters. Most recently she was seen Off Broadway as Clairee in "Steel Magnolias," first at the WPA Theater and then at the Lucille Lortel Theater. Her stage credits included "Camino Real" at the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival, "The Farm" at the Folger Theater in Washington, "The Heiress" at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., and several dramas at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.         Mrs. Wilkinson was born in San Francisco and majored in music and drama at San Jose State College in California. She moved to New York in the 1930's. In 1959, she played the lead in a production of "La Madre," a drama about the 16th-century nun who became St. Teresa of Avila. She also appeared on television in shows including "Studio One," "Omnibus" and "The Guiding Light." In 1987, she co-starred with Anne Pitoniak in "A Mistaken Charity" for public television's "American Playhouse" series.         In addition to her son Jeffrey, she is survived by another son, John, of Chicago.       
         Dorothy Van Doren, author, editor and widow of the poet and critic Mark Van Doren, died on Sunday at the Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn., where she lived. She was 96.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son John, of Evanston, Ill.         Mrs. Van Doren was born in San Francisco, but grew up in New York City. She was a graduate of Barnard College.         She published four novels, including "Those First Affections" (1938), a highly praised effort to create the subjective world of a young girl.         Later, she turned to light-hearted autobiography. "The Country Wife" (1950) was an informal discourse on matrimony, parenthood and life as an amateur farmer in Connecticut. "The Professor and I" (1959) told of life with her husband the poet, and "Men, Women and Cats" (1960) reported further observations on family life.         She was for many years an editor on The Nation, and during World War II ran the English desk at the Office of War Information, which later became Voice of America.         Her husband died in 1972. In addition to her son John, she is survived by another son, Charles, of Cornwall, Conn., and Cortona, Italy, four grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Barbara Redmond Ryan, a volunteer for social causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.         Her husband, Allan A. Ryan 3d, said the cause of death was cancer.         Mrs. Ryan was a member of the women's committee of the Boys' Club of New York for 30 years and served on the club's board for 20 years. She was a co-founder of the committee's Homework Help program, which provides after-school counseling for underprivileged youth.         She was an active member of the Zoological Society of New York and of the New York Junior League, and a longtime organizer of Les Boutiques de Noel, which raises funds for Cancer Care, the Children's Aid Society and other organizations.         Mrs. Ryan, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1955.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Melissa and Sally, both of Manhattan; a son, Allan A. 4th, of Palm Beach, Fla.; her mother, Frances Jones Redmond of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Jean Cushing of Riverside, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Sydelle Stephany Reisman, owner of the Westport (Conn.) Research Group and active in civic affairs in Westport, died on Wednesday in Norwalk Hospital. She was 65 and had homes in Westport and Carefree, Ariz.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Reisman, known as Syd, was born in New York City, graduated from New York University and held a master's degree in library science from Southern Connecticut State College. She was on the Westport Public Library staff before founding her company in 1985, providing computerized information to clients.         She is survived by her husband, Bert M.; two daughters, Robin Lee Reisman of Manhattan and Jodie Sue Reisman of Wilton, Conn.; a son, Michael J. of Manhattan; and a sister, Irene Topolcic of Virginia Beach, Va.       
         Elsie Coulson Bloch, a fabric stylist and colorist, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan and Kempton, Pa.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         A native of Malta, Mrs. Bloch was raised in the Channel Islands and London. She worked at Duraloom Carpet Mills in the Bronx, where her husband, Godfrey Bloch, was president.         Mrs. Bloch also renovated brownstone homes in New York City. She was president of the Daughters of the British Empire in New York State and was made a member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.         Mrs. Bloch's husband died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Anne Snee, and a son, Godfrey C., both of Manhattan.       
         Ruby Keeler, the innocent-faced tap-dancing sweetheart of nine Warner Brothers musicals in the 1930's, died yesterday morning at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was cancer, said her daughter Kathleen Lowe.         In seven of those musicals, including "42d Street," "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," Miss Keeler was teamed with Dick Powell, and they became one of the most popular screen couples of the early 1930's. Among the songs she introduced were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo," "42d Street," "Honeymoon Hotel," "She's a Latin From Manhattan" and "Too Marvelous for Words."  A Comeback at 60         In 1971, 30 years after she had retired from show business, Miss Keeler starred on Broadway in a revival of the 1925 musical "No, No, Nanette." The show, which ran for 871 performances, was among the season's surprise hits and won warm critical notices for its star, whose return to show business at the age of 60 was hailed one of the most remarkable show business comebacks in years.         Miss Keeler was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Aug. 25, 1910, and moved to New York City with her family when she was 4. At the age of 13, after receiving three months of dance instruction, she got her first job in the chorus of the George M. Cohan show "The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly." For the next three years she worked in New York nightclubs, and in 1926, she was discovered at a dance contest by Earl Lindsay, a stage director who cast her in the Broadway revue "Bye, Bye, Bonnie."         At her next Broadway appearance, in the musical "Lucky," she was spotted by Florenz Ziegfeld, who offered her a role in the musical "Whoopee," starring Eddie Cantor. But before rehearsals began, she went to Los Angeles for a brief stage engagement. There she met Al Jolson, whom she married in 1928. Although signed to star in the Ziegfeld extravaganza "Show Girl," she dropped out of the show during tryouts to join Jolson on the West Coast. Five years later she made her film debut in the movie musical "42d Street."         In the film, which is regarded as the quintessential backstage musical, Miss Keeler played Peggy Sawyer, a smiling young member of the chorus line who takes over for the leading lady on opening night, saves the show, and finds happiness with Billy Lawler (Mr. Powell). Among the numbers she sang were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" and the title song. Busby Berkeley's Style         The film introduced the elaborately choreographed routines of Busby Berkeley in which dozens of toe-tapping, high-kicking dancers were arranged in fantastic kaleidoscopic designs. After its success, the same formula was applied to "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," which also teamed Miss Keeler with Powell, and again had choreography by Berkeley and songs by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.         Miss Keeler went on to star in six more films for Warners before leaving the studio at Jolson's insistence. The films included "Dames" and "Flirtation Walk" (both 1934), "Go Into Your Dance" (her only film with Jolson) and "Shipmates Forever" (both 1935), "Colleen" (1936) and "Ready, Willing and Able" (1937).         "Mother Carey's Chickens" (1938), under a new contract with RKO, was a failure. She made her last film, "Sweetheart of the Campus," in 1941.         In 1940, her marriage to Jolson ended, and she retained custody of their 5-year-old adopted son, Al Jr. The next year, she married John Homer Lowe, a real estate broker in Pasadena, Calif., and retired. They had three daughters and a son.  An Association Spokeswoman         Shortly after her husband's death in 1969, the producer Harry Rigby called Miss Keeler and invited her to return to Broadway in "No, No, Nanette." Her name had been suggested, he said, by Berkeley, the show's production supervisor, who was then 74. Miss Keeler ended up staying with the show for its full two-year run and then touring with it for two more years.         In 1974, Miss Keeler had a brain aneurysm. She later became spokeswoman for the National Stroke Association, which established the Ruby Keeler Fellowship Memorial.         In addition to her daughter Ms. Lowe and her son Al Jolson Jr., she is survived by another son, John Lowe Jr., and two other daughters, Theresa Hall and Christine Pratt.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.

         Irene Claire Fromer, a retired teacher and artist, died on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital on Staten Island. She was 70 and lived on Staten Island and in St. Croix, V.I.         Her death was a result of a myocardial flu virus, said her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Stephen Fromer.         Mrs. Fromer, a graduate of Hunter College, earned a master's degree at Columbia University with a thesis on Herman Melville and the industrial revolution. She taught in the public schools and at one time worked for Merck & Company, writing abstracts on new drugs.         She was an expert in Haitian art and had some of her own work -- paintings, collages and sculptures -- shown at several exhibitions. Together with her husband, she worked at Medical Consultants V.I. in St. Croix, advising doctors on office management.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Fromer is survived by a son, Dr. Carl H., of Staten Island; a daughter, Dr. Sandra A. Stingle of Manhattan; her mother, Bella Siegel of Staten Island; a brother, Jack Siegel of New Rochelle, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Bertha Mather McPherson, founder and first president of the Darien (Conn.) Historical Society, died Friday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. She was 86 and lived in Darien at the Mather Homestead, an historic landmark her family has called home since 1778.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         A native of Chicago, Mrs. McPherson was a 1928 graduate of Vassar College. She went on to the Cambridge School of Landscape and Domestic Architecture, a program operated by Smith College, earning a master's degree in 1933, and became a registered architect in Connecticut. She was long associated with the Student Conservation Association, a nonprofit educational organization that places student volunteers with national parks, forests and wildlife refuges.         Mrs. McPherson is survived by her husband of over 60 years, Edward R. McPherson Jr.; two daughters, Anne McPherson Tracy of Ridgefield, Conn., and Jane McPherson Nickerson of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Stephen Mather McPherson of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
         Regina Kiely Fox, a New York sportswoman and philanthropist, died on Sunday at her home in North Salem, N.Y. She was 87.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Fox was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was active in the Crescent Club in Huntington, L.I., where she once won the club championships in golf and tennis in the same year.         Her husband, Frank, founded a development corporation based in Brooklyn that in the 1920's and 1930's built many homes in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island. He died in 1976.         Mrs. Fox oversaw the charitable work of the Fox family. Together with her son Terence she founded the annual Frank Fox Memorial Polo Tournament to raise money for public television, museums, youth groups and educational institutions. Since 1984 the proceeds of the annual polo match have gone to the scholarship fund of Marymount College.         She also served as a judge at the North Salem Horse Show and the Piping Rock and Smithtown Horse Shows on Long Island.         Mrs. Fox is survived by a daughter, Constance; two other sons, Frank and Michael; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Tester Carothers, a singer and dancer in Broadway musicals in the 1920's and early 30's, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Weston, Mass., where she lived. She was 89.         Miss Tester was best known for her rendition of "Sing Something Simple" in "The Second Little Show." She sang the number again in "Garrick Gaieties of 1930," whose stars included Imogene Coca and Rosalind Russell.         She also appeared in "Lollipop," "A Lucky Break," "The Ramblers," "Bunk of 1926" and "The Gang's All Here."         She was married for 59 years to Frederick Carothers, a sales executive, who died in 1990. She is survived by a son, Peter, of Wellesley, Mass., and two granddaughters.       
         Kate Reid, an actress whose hundreds of roles included starring onstage in "Death of a Salesman," in the film "Atlantic City" and in television episodes of "Dallas," died on Saturday at her home in Stratford, Ontario. She was 62.         The cause of death was cancer, said her agent, Richard Schmenner.         For more than 40 years she was staple of stage, movies and television in the United States, Canada and Britain. A 1984 New York Times profile said, "Kate Reid may not be a household name to the general public, but she is to the theater industry, which knows her as an actress who works constantly."         Perhaps her most widely praised performance was as the wife of Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman in the acclaimed revival of "Death of a Salesman" on Broadway in 1984 and for television in 1985.         "In the problematic role of the mother, Kate Reid is miraculously convincing," Frank Rich wrote in The Times, adding that "she somehow melds affection with pure steel." Richard Schickel said in Time magazine that her performance was "in its way as awesome as Hoffman's." A String of Nominations         Twice she was nominated for Tony Awards, first for co-starring with Alec Guinness in "Dylan" in 1964, then for her performance in "Slapstick Tragedy" on Broadway in 1965.         She was also twice nominated for Emmy Awards, for playing Queen Victoria in "The Invincible Mr. Disraeli" in 1963, then Mary Todd Lincoln in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" in 1964. Both were "Hallmark Hall of Fame" productions.         In the 1981 film "Atlantic City," she won high marks for her portrayal of the reclusive, aging former beauty queen and sometime paramour of the small-time mobster played by Burt Lancaster.         Ms. Reid, whose voice was described as cello-toned, once said: "I'm a chameleon. There is something of everything I play in me."         Her stage work included many Shakespearean parts, especially at the Stratford Festival in Canada in the 1960's. Major Roles on Broadway         In her Broadway debut in 1962, she was praised for her performance as Martha in the matinee cast of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" In 1968, she co-starred in "The Price," by Arthur Miller. She played Big Mama in the 1974 revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea and Fred Gwynne.         Her films include "The Andromeda Strain" (1971), "A Delicate Balance" (1973) and "Equus" (1977). Her many television roles included recurring appearances in "Dallas" as Aunt Lil Trotter.         Miss Reid was born in London and grew up in Toronto. She began acting while attending Havergal College, the University of Toronto and the Toronto Conservatory of Music, then formally studied acting under Uta Hagen at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.         Her marriages to Michael Sadlier and Austin Willis ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Reid Willis of Edmonton, Alberta, and a daughter, Robin Willis of Manhattan.       
         Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won several Emmy awards for her work on Olympics broadcasts for ABC Sports, died yesterday at her home in West Tisbury, Mass. She was 63 and also lived in Vail, Colo.         The cause of death was cancer of the uterus, said her son, Robert P. Riger of Manhattan.         In 1973, Ms. Sanger became one of the first female producers in network television sports when she was hired by ABC to develop women's programs. Over the next decade, she produced dozens of programs for the network, including parts of Olympic broadcasts from Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.         She left ABC in 1985 and moved to London, but continued working part-time for the network and also produced programs for other organizations. She was a member of several professional groups and also was an adjunct lecturer in the media arts department at the University of Arizona.         Ms. Sanger was born Sept. 15, 1929, in Hong Kong and attended Smith College before earning a master's degree in public law and government at Columbia University. Before joining ABC Sports, she worked for several other television and news organizations.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three other children, Christopher Riger of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Victoria Riger Phillips of New Orleans, and Charlotte Riger Hull of West Tisbury, Mass.; a sister, Helen Sanger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  March 9, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won Emmy awards for sports broadcasts, misidentified one of her residences. It was Vail, Ariz., not Colorado.       
         Dr. Lillian Batlin Garvey, a family physician who practiced on the Upper East Side for 47 years, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was bone marrow disease, her family said.         The physician, known professionally as Dr. Batlin, continued to see patients until illness overcame her in February. She also taught for many years as a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York Medical College and worked on the staff of Metropolitan Hospital Center and Beth Israel Hospital North.         A native of the city, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard College in 1934 at the age of 18 and earned a master's degree in philosophy at Columbia University a year later. She received her medical degree in 1939 from New York University College of Medicine and was an intern at Bellevue Hospital. She went into private practice in 1946.         Dr. Batlin was a charter member of the American Board of Family Practice, a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a fellow of the American College of Cardiology. She also served as a vice president of the board of governors of the New York University College of Medicine Alumni Association.         Dr. Batlin's husband, Dr. Thomas Quincy Garvey Jr., a neurosurgeon, died in 1972. She is survived by a daughter, Dr. Glenda Garvey of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Thomas Q. Garvey 3d of Potomac, Md., and a grandson.       
         Dorothy Roberts, a Canadian poet, died on April 23 in State College, Pa. She was 86.         Her work was widely anthologized in Canada and the United States. Her books include "Songs for Swift Feet," "In Star and Stalk," "Twice to Flame" and "The Self of Loss."         Born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Ms. Roberts attended the University of New Brunswick and later was a reporter for The Fredericton Daily Mail. She married August Leisner in 1929. In 1940, the couple moved to the United States, settling first in Ithaca, N.Y., and then in State College. Ms. Roberts became at familiar figure at the Pennsylvania State University, where she organized poetry discussions and readings.         Her most recent work is "In the Flight of Stars" (Goose Lane Editions, 1991), which she described as "a collection of later life poems."         She is survived by a son, John Leisner of California.       
         Frances Cullman Boas, a founder and trustee of the Gomez Foundation for Mill House, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mill House, in Marlboro, N.Y., is believed to be the oldest extant house built by a Jewish family in America.  The stone first story was constructed in 1714 by one of Mrs. Boas's ancestors, Louis Moses Gomez, as a home and trading post for his fur trade with the Indians. In 1772, it was bought by Wolfert Acker, who added a second story of brick.         Mrs. Boas was an enthusiastic angler, skilled at fly fishing for trout and salmon. She was the daughter of Joseph F. Cullman Jr. and Frances Wolff Cullman. Her father was a merchant of tobacco, cigars and cigarettes. Mrs. Boas's brother, Joseph Cullman 3d of Manhattan, is chairman emeritus of Philip Morris Companies.         Another brother, Edgar, also of Manhattan, is chairman of the Culbro Corporation of Manhattan, a diversified products company. Her brother Lewis, of Manhattan, is president of Cullman Ventures Inc., a private holding company.         Her husband, Percy E. Boas, a cotton broker, died in 1982.         Besides her three brothers, Mrs. Boas is survived by two daughters, Frances Jacobs Frawley and Barbara Jacobs Tamerin, both of Manhattan; a son, Robert Allen Jacobs Jr., of Westport, Conn.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mary, Viscountess Rothermere, a philanthropist and socialite, died last Thursday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla., at the age of 62. She had homes in Palm Beach, Manhattan, Monte Carlo and Newport, R.I.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         She was a supporter of Save the Bay in Newport and an organizer of fund-raising events for many other charities. She had also served on the boards of Stratford Hall Plantation in Virginia and the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif.         A native of Dallas, she was a member of a prominent business family in Texas as the daughter of Kenneth Murchison. After attending Sweetbriar College, she married Ricard R. Ohrstrom, a financier and industrialist.         After they divorced, she moved to England in 1966 and remarried, to Viscount Rothermere. He headed a British publishing empire that included The Daily Mail newspaper. After his death in 1978, she returned to the United States.         She leaves six sons by Mr. Ohrstrom, Ricard Jr. of Greenwich, Conn.; Kenneth of McLean, Va.;, George of Berrville, Va.; Christopher of Strasbourg, France; Barnaby of Tampa, Fla., and Mark of London, all of whom retained the Ohrstrom name, and one son by the Viscount, Esmond Harmsworth of Cambridge, Mass. She is also survived by two sisters, Anne Smith of Boston and Jane Hamilton of Denver; a brother, Kenneth Murchison of Las Cruces, N.M., and several grandchildren.       
         Raphaelle Jeanne Semmes, a senior civil servant who became executive director of the Bush Administration's Commission on Environmental Quality, died Tuesday at the Washington Home Hospice. She was 46 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, said her sister Walden S. Morton.         Miss Semmes went into Government service in 1970 as a supervisor in the Department of Transportation. She served as executive secretary of the Peace Corps from 1982 to 1989.         In the fall of 1991 she was named executive director of the new panel set up to advise President George Bush on ways to protect the environment without excessive cost.         Miss Semmes was born in New Orleans. She graduated from George Washington University and received a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         Her marriage to Robert Taylor of Washington ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, Walden, of Center Harbor, N.H., she is survived by a son, Raphael James Taylor; her parents, Vice Adm. Benedict J. Semmes, retired, and Katherine Ainsworth Semmes of Washington; another sister, Amy Semmes Waite of Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, Dr. B. J. Semmes of Chevy Chase, Md.       
         Katharine Casey Gerrity, a volunteer worker in Westchester County, died yesterday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. She was 65 and lived in Rye, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Gerrity is survived by her husband, Edward J. Gerrity; a daughter, Katharine C. 2d of Greenwich; a son, Edward 3d of Rye Brook, N.Y.; two sisters, Angela Marshall of Dalton, Pa., and Grace Kavanagh of Peoria, Ill., and a brother, Robert, of Scranton.       
         Marka Truesdale duPont, a patron of mental-health groups and the performing arts, died Tuesday at her home in Wilmington, Del. She was 82.         She had had a prolonged illness, her family said.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Chapin School. As a young woman, she worked for the Henry Street Settlement Theater.         Moving to Vermont in 1942, she became publisher and editor of The Burlington Daily News. During her tenure it won an award from Editor and Publisher magazine for exposing squalid conditions at a reform school for boys and at the state mental hospital in Waterbury.         Later, in Delaware, she was the founding chairman of that state's Mental Health Association and an officer and fund-raiser in the National Association for Mental Health, of which she was a past president.         Mrs. duPont's first marriage, to Grover Loening, an aviation designer with Orville Wright, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, A. Felix duPont Jr., a member of the duPont family of Wilmington; two daughters by her previous marriage, Louise Truesdale Loening of Landenberg, Pa., and Priscilla Loening Hanford of Paradise, Calif.; a son, Christopher T. duPont of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepson, Michael Hoyt duPont of Union, Wash.; a stepdaughter, Katharine duPont Gahagan of Wilmington, and a sister, Anne Truesdale Broadhurst of Wilton, Conn.       
         Elizabeth Montgomery, a costume and set designer and a founding partner of the design company Motley, died on Saturday at her home in London. She was 91.         Miss Montgomery was born in Kid lington, Oxfordshire, and grew up in Cambridge, England. She attended Westminster Art School in London, studying portrait painting with Walter Sickert. In 1932, she and two other art students, Margaret Harris and Sophia Harris, founded a theatrical design group, which they named Motley, an allusion to the line "Motley's the only wear" from "As You Like It."         Motley created its first costumes for "Romeo and Juliet," directed by John Gielgud at Oxford University, and the company soon made its mark with costumes for his production of "Richard of Bordeaux." The Gielgud collaboration continued for the next decade. The company created sets and costumes for more than 30 Old Vic productions. An American Branch         In 1940, Miss Montgomery and Margaret Harris traveled to the United States as the costume designers for "Romeo and Juliet," starring Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. After marrying the writer Robert P. Wilmot, Miss Montgomery took up residence in the United States.         As the American branch of Motley, she and Miss Harris created costumes for Katharine Cornell in "The Doctor's Dilemma" and "The Three Sisters" in the early 1940's. Miss Harris returned to Britain in 1946. Miss Montgomery's later Broadway credits include "Anne of the Thousand Days," "Peter Pan" "South Pacific," "The Most Happy Fella," "Paint Your Wagon" and "Can-Can."         In 1958, her costumes for "The First Gentleman" won a Tony Award. That year she designed sets and costumes for "Il Trovatore" at the Metropolitan Opera.         Motley created the costumes for the David Lean film "Great Expectations," and Miss Montgomery designed the costumes for "Oklahoma!," "Little Women" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night."         The partners in Motley wrote two books, "Designing and Making Stage Costumes" (1964, reissued by Routledge in 1992) and "Theater Props" (1975).         She is survived by a son, John Wilmot of Fremantle, Australia, and four stepdaughters: Patricia Christgau of Woodbury, Conn., Dorothy Zinbardi of Brentwood, L.I., Roberta Wilmot of Idaho and Joan Clarke of Spokane, Wash.       
         Jane Pack Dessau, an advertising executive, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer after a four-year battle, her husband, Stephen P. Dessau said.         In 1989, Jane Pack, as she was known professionally, was named an executive vice president of Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, a subsidiary of Grey Advertising. In 1988, Advertising Age magazine named her one of the 100 "best and brightest" advertising and marketing women in the United States.         After 13 years with Levine Huntley, she left the organization, because of her health, in 1991, shortly before the agency closed. Throughout her illness, she was active in Reach for Recovery, a program of the American Cancer Society, and the T. J. Martell Foundation for Cancer and Aids Research.         Mrs. Dessau was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from SUNY-Albany and received an M.B.S. from Baruch College.         Besides her husband, survivors include a daughter, Julianna Sara, and a son, David Stephen; her parents, Dr. Milton Pack and Phyllis Pack of Brooklyn, and two brothers, Dr. Philip Pack of Scarsdale and Dr. Michael Pack of Boston.       
         Valentina S. Grizodubova, a World War II air commander and pioneer aviator who was known as the Soviet Union's Amelia Earhart, died on Wednesday in Russia. She was 83.         Itar-Tass news agency attributed her death to complications of a stomach ulcer.         In 1938, Colonel Grizodubova and two other women flew nearly 4,000 miles nonstop from Moscow to the Soviet east coast near Japan in their plane, the Motherland.         After radio communication failed, their fate was unknown for several days. Running out of fuel, the plane made a forced landing in a swamp. The navigator bailed out beforehand. The crew withstood three days of rain, chased off bears and contended with a lynx in the cockpit. A Hero's Welcome         Finally rescuers found the crew, and they returned to a hero's welcome in Moscow, hailed as "daughters of the people."         The flight set a distance record for women. Miss Earhart's 1932 solo flight from Newfoundland to Ireland was a third shorter. Flying in light sport planes, Colonel Grizodubova, set other records for altitude, speed and distance for women.         Awarded the Order of Lenin and decorated as a Hero of the Soviet Union, she became a Supreme Soviet deputy and was named head of women's aviation.         In World War II, she commanded an air regiment of long-range planes, flew bombing missions and survived attacks by German fighters.         "In my experience, girls make just as good pilots as men," she said in 1942. "You cannot judge by appearance. I know girls so quiet and apparently timid that they blush when spoken to, yet they pilot bombers over Germany without qualm. No country at war today can afford to ignore the tremendous reservoir of woman power."         She married an army pilot captain, Viktor Sokoloff, and they had a son, Valerik.       
         Dorothy B. Hughes, a mystery writer as well as a critic and historian of mystery fiction, died on Thursday at her home in Ashland, Ore. She was 88.         She died of complications from a stroke, said her daughter Suzy Sarna.         Ms. Hughes wrote 14 mystery novels, most of them set in the Southwest and involving an upper-class hero caught up in evil intrigue. Her best-known works include "The Cross-Eyed Bear" (1940), "Ride the Pink Horse" (1946), "The Expendable Man" (1964) and "In a Lonely Place" (1947), which was made into a movie starring Humphrey Bogart. In 1979 she won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, of which she was a founding member, for her critical biography "Erle Stanley Gardner: The Case of the Real Perry Mason" (1978).         Ms. Hughes was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. She also studied at the University of New Mexico and Columbia University. After working as a reporter and women's editor in the 1920's, she began reviewing crime fiction for The Albuquerque Tribune, The Los Angeles News, The Los Angeles Mirror and The New York Herald Tribune. In 1961 she began reviewing for The Los Angeles Times.         In 1978, the Mystery Writers of America gave her its Grand Master Award in recognition of her life's work in fiction and criticism.         In addition to her daughter Suzy, of Anacortes, Wash., she is survived by a brother, Frank Flanagan, of Phoenix; a sister, Calla Haye, of Santa Fe; another daughter, Holly Hughes of Rowe, N.M.; a son, Antony A. Hughes, of El Paso, Tex.; 10 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Bernice Feinstein, a former lecturer on music history at George Washington University, died on Sunday at King Edward VII Hospital in Bermuda. She was 67 and lived in McLean, Va.         She was stricken during a vacation and died after heart surgery, said her son John, who lives in Bethesda, Md. She was in Bermuda with her family to celebrate her 40 years of marriage to Martin Feinstein, general director of the Washington Opera.         A native of Manhattan, the former Bernice Richman graduated from Smith College and earned a master's degree in music from Barnard College and a doctorate in music from Columbia University.         Her association with George Washington University began after her husband, a former vice president of Sol Hurok Concerts in New York, was named executive director of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. From 1976 until two years ago, she taught courses on the history of Western music and opera history.         In addition to her husband and son John, Mrs. Feinstein is survived by another son, Robert, and a daughter, Margaret, both of McLean, and a brother, Peter Richman of Lexington, Mass.       
         Joan S. Harrison, associate dean of studies at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.         A native of Orange, N.J., she graduated magna cum laude from Tufts University. She earned an M.A. degree in Arabic history from Harvard University, an M.S. in administration from Bank Street College and, in 1988, a Ph.D. in human development from Union Graduate School in Cincinnati.         She came to Sarah Lawrence in 1973 as an assistant to the dean of studies. She was promoted to assistant dean the following year and to associate dean in 1980.         Graduates and friends of the college's Center for Continuing Education endowed a scholarship in her name last November. In April she received the annual Carol Russett Award from the American Council on Education/National Identification Program for the Advancement of Women in Higher Education Administration.         Dr. Harrison is survived by her husband, David; a son, Andy of Evanston, Ill.; a daughter, Rachel Harrison of Brooklyn; her parents, Rose and Harry Horowitz of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and a sister, Eleanor Dain of Kingston, R.I.       
         Beatrice Bishop Berle, a physician, teacher and author, died on Friday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass.  She was 90 years old.         Her death was caused by complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Beatrice Berle Meyerson.         Dr. Berle, who ran a neighbhorhood health clinic in East Harlem from 1953 until 1962, took a pioneering approach to family medicine by treating the entire family for the effects of heroin abuse by a member. She also helped to establish methadone maintenance as a significant treatment for heroin abuse.         Dr. Berle, who was born on Aug. 6, 1902, in Lenox, Mass, graduated from Vassar College in 1923. She received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1924 and a medical degree from New York University in 1938.         In 1927 she married Adolf A. Berle Jr., an economist and lawyer who served during the Roosevelt Administration as Assistant Secretary of State. Dr. Berle worked in the United States Public Health Service in Washington from 1943 until 1944. Worked in Brazil         Traveling to Brazil with her husband, who was Ambassador to Brazil from 1945 until 1946, Dr. Berle volunteered in hospital wards in Rio de Janeiro, where she organized efforts to expand the practice of preventive medicine. She also wrote articles and edited a book on medical problems in Brazil.         Her other books were "Eighty Puerto Rican Families in New York City," a study of the families in her East Harlem clinic, published by Columbia University Press in 1958, and "A Life in Two Worlds," an autobiography published in in 1983 by Walker & Company.         During her career, Dr. Berle was associated with St. Luke's Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Bronx State Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, New York University Medical College and Yeshiva University.         After the death of her first husband in 1971, Dr. Berle in 1975 married Dr. Andre F. Cournand, a physican who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Dr. Cournand died in 1988.         In addition to Ms. Meyerson, of Washington, Dr. Berle is survived by another daughter, Alice Berle Crawford of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Peter A. A. Berle of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence W. Hartstein, a leader in Jewish community organizations in this country and in Israel, died on Friday at the Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her son, Norman.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Hartstein was vice president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue's Women's Club, co-president of AMIT, the national Zionist organization of religious women, and a board member of Re'uth, an international Jewish social service agency based in Israel.         Mrs. Hartstein lived in Manhattan.  She was the widow of Dr. Jacob I. Hartstein, dean of the graduate schools of Yeshiva University and Long Island University, who died in 1991.         Besides her son Norman of Los Angeles, she is survived by another son, Kalman, of Woodmere, L.I., and three grandchildren.       
         Eunice Saunders Carroll, an employee of Sotheby's for 40 years and the director of its Special Client Services Department, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 73.         A Sotheby's associate said the cause was pneumonia.         During her years with Sotheby's, herpurchases for auction sales totaled well into the billions of dollars, including the Duchess of Windsor's jewels and the collections of Greta Garbo, Florence Gould and Andy Warhol.         Mrs. Carroll was born in North Carolina and taught English for several years before becoming a paymaster in the Navy during World War II. She later came to New York and took a job as a bookkeeper at Parke-Bernet Galleries, Sotheby's predecessor in the United States. After the two merged, she became a vice president and, in 1978, a senior vice president.         She was among the early in-house bidders -- Sotheby's representatives who initiate telephone bids for major art collectors who do not want to appear on the auction floor.         She is survived by her son, James Carroll of Greenfield, Mass; her daughter, Nedda Carroll of High Falls, N.Y.; her niece, Cynthia Leigh Young of New York City; three sisters, Inez Alexakos of Stafford, Va., Jeanette Lucas of Crofton, Md., and Josephine Lee of Lake Katrine, N.Y., and her brother, Eriel Saunders of Willow Springs, N.C.       
         Vera, the artist and designer whose name has been emblazoned on brightly printed scarves, bed and table linens, draperies and sportswear for nearly 50 years, died on Tuesday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.         The cause was cardiac arrest after surgery, said Tom Costello, a friend and business associate.         Vera Neumann, who used only her first name professionally, was a painter whose work was exhibited in many countries, and her designs typically began as paintings. For motifs, she preferred flowers, leaves, ferns, grass, vegetables, the sun and ladybugs. A "ladybug means good luck in every language," she said.         She introduced the first signature scarf in the late 1940's. Another trend she started was to offer collections saluting the countries she visited in her frequent travels, including Brazil, Denmark, Finland, India and Portugal. A Taste for Purity         Vera's style could be realistic or abstract. Her penchant for purity could mean a scarf or place mat printed in one color at a time when other designers might have used a dozen.         "If you have too many colors," she explained, "you could easily get tied down to just one color scheme that can't be changed." A shy, private person, she did not like to make speeches. "Color is the language I speak best," she said.         Vera was born in Stamford, Conn., and took night classes at Cooper Union, which honored her with its Outstanding Alumna Award. She was a designer of children's furniture and murals when she met and married George Neumann. They and a third partner, F. Werner Hamm, each risked $1,000 in 1946 to start a business. Its first order, from B. Altman, was for three place mats, made of parachute silk and hand-delivered by Mr. Hamm.         The enterprise prospered. By 1977, Vera designs were sold in more than 1,200 stores, with sales of more than $100 million. The company had been bought 10 years earlier for $5 million by Manhattan Industries and has been a division of Salant Corporation since 1988. Vera Companies -- Scarves by Vera and Linens by Vera -- has showrooms on Fifth Avenue, and Vera herself continued to supply designs until several months ago.         Vera's husband died in 1960. She is survived by her daughter, Evelyn Fyler of Ossining; her son, John Neumann of Carmel, N.Y, and four grandchildren.       
         Virginia Moore, a poet and biographer, died on Friday at Westmoreland, a nursing home affiliated with Lake Forest Hospital in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 89 and lived in Scottsville, Va.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter-in-law, Betty-Ann Moore.         Ms. Moore was born in Omaha. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., and a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. She began her career as a poet, publishing three volumes of lyric verse: "Not Poppy" (1926), "Sweet Water and Bitter" (1929), and "Homer's Golden Chain" (1937).         She was on the board of the Jefferson-Madison Regional Library and the Scottsville Museum.         She is survived by John Fitzallen Moore of Libertyville, Ill., a son by her first husband, the poet Louis Untermeyer; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Hannah Troy, an influential women's fashion designer and manufacturer who invented the petite size and introduced modern Italian styles to the United States, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Miami Beach, where she lived. She was 93.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Her two major contributions to fashion resulted from chance and keen observation.         "I was at a May Company store in California when I noticed women pulling at their shoulders and waistlines and saw that most dresses didn't fit properly," she recalled from the late 1940's. Alterations were troublesome and sometimes spoiled the design.         On a hunch that the long-waisted ideal female form was more myth than reality, she studied measurements the military had made of women who volunteered in World War II. The statistics confirmed that the typical woman was short-waisted.         So Mrs. Troy introduced the petite size, saying, "The word had a nice ring." The concept proved a popular success. The Italian Look         Her next innovation came in 1951. After the annual Paris fashion shows, she took a side trip to Florence. Impressed with its fashions, she bought samples and returned home promoting the Italian look.         The following season, 300 American fashion representatives showed up in Italy and a new era began.         In the mid-1960's she advocated the tent dress so "the woman who is a little plump can look stylish."         Mrs. Troy described her fashions as "elegant, somewhat classic, timeless, the kind a woman can add to from year to year." She produced blouses, dresses, gowns and suits, favoring silk, wool, tweed, linen, taffeta and satin.         Her career was at its peak from the late 1940's until her retirement in 1968. She supplied top Manhattan stores like Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller, Henri Bendel, Lord & Taylor, B. Altman and Bloomingdale's. Pat Nixon and Mamie Van Doren were among her customers.         Mrs. Troy, a Brooklyn native, grew up in the garment industry.         "I started sewing as soon as I could thread a needle," she said. By 12 she was making dresses for her sisters. As a teen-ager, she was a model. After graduating as the valedictorian at Erasmus Hall High School, she worked at a blouse company, then opened her business.         She supported charities and made a personal cause of the Mazzini School in Florence after learning that some poor students took turns going to class because their families had only one coat and one pair of shoes to share among the siblings.         Mrs. Troy had three marriages, to Aaron Hartman, Theodore Troy and Max Meyer, all deceased.         She is survived by a son from her first marriage, William J. Troy, and a sister, Shirley Stern, both of Miami, and two grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Tobey, a painter known for her covers for The New Yorker, died on June 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was in her mid-80's.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her son, David.         Mrs. Tobey, whose original name was Beatrice Szanton, was born in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Vienna. While attending Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, she landed the part of an ingenue in a Broadway show. After the show closed, she went to Hollywood to pursue an acting career, but she returned to New York a year later.         In 1928, she married one of her former high school classmates, Barney Tobey, a cartoonist whose work would appear regularly in The New Yorker for the next five decades, until his death in 1989.         Mrs. Tobey attended the Art Students League, where she studied with Yasuo Kuniyoshi. She developed an Expressionist style, and her work was exhibited in galleries in New York. Between 1959 and 1969, she contributed 11 covers to The New Yorker, signed B. Szanton to distinguish them from the cartoons and covers of her husband, who signed his work B. Tobey.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Natasha Tubelskaya, of Rome.       
         Jean Bodfish Brown, a civic leader in New York and Chicago, died on June 18 at her home in Chicago at the age of 52. The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Brown was a founding member and chairwoman of the Friends of the Zoo, which worked with the New York Zoological Society to help renovate the Central Park Zoo and to foster environmental education in city schools.         Later she helped found the Food Animal Concerns Trust, which advocates treating farm animals humanely. She was on the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago and was co-chairwoman of its centennial celebration.         She was also the president of the Alliance Francaise de Chicago from 1990 to 1992. She helped revitalize the organization, open its new headquarters and expand its program of concerts, lectures and films.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Orinda, Calif.

She was on the board of the Henry Street Settlement for nearly 30 years and was also an active supporter of Lenox Hill Hospital.         She was married to Frederick Warburg, an investment banker, sportsman and philanthropist. He was the eldest son of Felix M.

         Ida Sciolino Antonucci, a retired senior executive and buyer of clothes for young women at Bloomingdale's department stores, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Antonucci, known professionally as Ida Sciolino, worked at Bloomingdale's for 30 years, retiring in 1980. Her expertise included bridal gowns, robes and lounge wear, and junior sportswear, dresses, coats and suits.         Her responsibilities for the main store and eight branches included choosing colors, designs, fabrics and silhouettes. She oversaw budgets, advertising, display and the selection and training of young executives and new sales clerks.         Working with designers and manufacturers, she selected and bought merchandise in this country, European nations, India and Hong Kong.         She believed in American talent, and to find it she scoured ateliers, lofts and garages in the Village and Bowery where some designers had little shops of their own.         A native of Buffalo, she graduated from D'Youville College there and took graduate courses in engineering and fabrics at the University of Buffalo. Before joining Bloomingdale's in 1950, she worked for five years as senior executive buyer of junior wear at Hengerer's Department Store in Buffalo.         Mrs. Antonucci is survived by her husband, Anthony J.; a son, Peter A. of Manhattan; a sister, Marie Oberacker of Amherst, N.Y.; a brother, Anthony Sciolino of Buffalo, and one grandson.       
         Alice Magdol Conrad, who ran her own executive recruiting firm, Magdol & McCone, died on Wednesday at her country home in Bridgehampton, L.I. She was 52.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Magdol, who also lived in Manhattan, started her career as a copywriter at Seventeen magazine, moving to Adams Dana and Silverstein, an advertising agency in 1966. She subsequently joined Judy Wald Associates, a recruiting firm for the advertising industry, and then went to London where she founded that company's London office.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Conrad returned to New York where she joined Foote, Cone & Belding, the advertising agency.         In 1979 she founded Magdol & McCone with Bonnie McCone. Mrs. McCone retired shortly after the firm was founded.

         Darcy M. Cohen, the former owner of the Vernissage decorative arts boutique at the Henri Bendel store in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was 68.         She had had a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Cohen operated the Vernissage shop in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Earlier in her career she worked as a writer for the Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenberg radio program.         Ms. Cohen was born in Manhattan. Her grandfather, Israel Miller, was the founder of the I.

         Gusti Huber, a leading Viennese actress before World War II who continued her successful stage and film career in this country, died on Monday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 78.         The family said the cause was heart failure.         Ms. Huber made her American debut in 1952 in "Flight Into Egypt," the story of an Austrian refugee family struggling to get to America, directed by Elia Kazan. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Ms. Huber "brings a grave, sensitive beauty to the character and describes with rare perception the excitement and the pain of a woman whose responsibilities are beyond human strength." Portrayed Anne Frank's Mother         She is best known in this country for her portrayal of Edith Frank in the Broadway production of "The Diary of Anne Frank," which won the Pulitzer Prize and Critics Circle Award in 1956. "Gusti Huber gives a superbly controlled performance as the patient mother who is close to hysteria," wrote Mr. Atkinson.         Ms. Huber also won praise for her performance in George Stevens's 1959 film version of the Anne Frank story.  After retiring from acting in 1961, she lectured in New York area high schools on the legacy of Anne Frank, the Jewish girl who hid from the Nazis in a garret in Amsterdam and who died in a concentration camp shortly before the end of World War II..         While still a student at the Academy for Music and Representative Art in Vienna, Ms. Huber began her acting career in 1929 at the Deutsches Volkstheatre. Joining the Schauspielhaus in Zurich, she played more than 180 roles in a five-year period.         After the liberation of Austria in World War II, she joined a company entertaining American troops. She met and married Joseph Besch, a United States Army captain and former newspaperman.         She is survived by her husband of 47 years; three daughters, Christiana MacDonald of Paris, and Bibi Besch and Drea B. Gillogly, both of Los Angeles; a son, Andrew F. Besch of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
         Florence Turitz Bower, a music teacher for more than 60 years, who headed the voice department at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at home in Newton, Mass. She was 94 and had moved to Newton from New York City recently.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, Joseph, a professor in the Harvard School of Business Administration.         Mrs. Bower joined the faculty of the academy as a voice teacher in 1964, the year it was founded. She soon became chairwoman of the voice department, a position she held until retiring in 1991. Her students ranged from classical recitalists and opera singers to musical theater performers.         Before her work at the Academy, she was a member of the faculty of the Henry Street Settlement House and at the Dalcroze School of Music and taught many private pupils.         She began studying music at an early age and graduated in 1919 from the Institute of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         For the next eight years, she pursued music studies in Paris, Berlin and Florence, where her teachers included Egon Petri, Yvette Guilbert and Bertha Fiering Tapper. When osteoarthritis prevented a career as a pianist, she became an apprentice to a throat surgeon in Paris to study the mechanism of the singing voice.         Besides her son, Joseph L., survivors include a daughter, Ellen Feingold of Newton; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author, editor and illustrator of children's books, died on Wednesday at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. She was 75 and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         Her sister, Barbara Klaw, said the cause was lung cancer.         Mrs. Bevans's most widely distributed work is her illustrations for the original "Pat the Bunny," (Golden Books, 1940), created by Dorothy Kunhardt, the second-best-selling children's book ever, after "Peter Rabbit."         She is author and illustrator of "Thomas Retires," (Viking, 1939) a children's book. Other works include " 'I Wonder Why,' Thought the Owl," (Putnam, 1965) and "Danny Kaye's Around the World Story Book," (Random House, 1960), of which she was co-editor.         She was editor of a best-selling book for adults, "Vogue's Book of Etiquette," (Simon & Schuster, 1948), compiled by the late Millicent H. Fenwick. She also edited "McCall's Book of Everyday Etiquette" (Golden Press, 1960).         Born in New York City, she was the daughter of the historian and critic Carl Van Doren and of Irita Van Doren, for many years literary editor of The New York Herald Tribune. She studied art at Cooper Union in Manhattan.         In 1975 Mrs. Bevans and her family moved to West Cornwall, where she served on the Cornwall Board of Education from 1977 to 1983. She was also Cornwall's representative on the board of Housatonic Valley Regional High School.         She and her husband, Tom Torre Bevans, founded The Cornwall Chronicle in 1991. This monthly newspaper of community news is distributed free to all Cornwall residents and many out-of-town subscribers.         Besides her husband and sister of West Cornwall, surviving are two daughters, Anne Bevans of West Cornwall and Jane Duber of Lillooet, British Columbia; a son, John, of West Cornwall, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  July 25, 1993, Sunday         An obituary last Sunday about Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author and illustrator of children's books, included a work among her credits erroneously. "Pat the Bunny" (Golden Books, 1940) was illustrated by its author, Dorothy Kunhardt.       
         Halina Rodzinski, who worked for Polish charities and wrote "Our Two Lives," a memoir about her husband, the conductor Artur Rodzinski, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was chronic leukemia, said her son, Richard.         Mrs. Rodzinski was born in Warsaw. In 1934, she married Rodzinski and went with him to Cleveland, where he was music director of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Mrs. Rodzinski was active in several Polish charitable and cultural organizations, including Polish Mutual Assistance, founded in 1956 to help Poles in the United States who had been left destitute by World War II. From 1959 until her death she was president of the Committee for the Blind of Poland.         She was also a founding member and honorary chairman of the Harlem School of the Arts and for many years was on the advisory board of Young Concert Artists.         Mrs. Rodzinski's 1976 memoir, "Our Two Lives," received critical praise for its vivid portrayal of her husband as an autocratic, temperamental genius who conducted with a baton in his right hand and a loaded revolver in his hip pocket. Mr. Rodzinski, who died in 1958, was music director of the New York Philharmonic from 1943 to 1948.         In May, Mrs. Rodzinski was awarded Poland's highest civilian honor, the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit.         In addition to her son, who is the executive director of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, she is survived by a sister, Aniela Mieczyslawska of London, and a grandchild.       
         Caroline Klein Simon, who overcame early obstacles to women in the legal profession to become a pioneering female judge, politician, state official and champion of laws against discrimination in jobs and housing, died yesterday at home. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Judge Simon, who was still active as a lawyer at her death, served in state posts under appointments from both Republican and Democratic governors and was the first woman nominated by a major party for citywide office in New York City.         She helped draft the nation's first state law barring job discrimination and later led the nation in imposing regulations against racial "block busting" by real-estate brokers.         Judge Simon's credo was simple. "I am against discrimination in any form," she said.         During her own career, she faced discrimination from the very beginning.         She was rejected for admission to Columbia University's law school in the 1920's because it did not have toilets and other accommodations for female students, her family said. So she earned her law degree at New York University instead. Failed Search for Paying Job         After graduation, despite her strong academic record and passing the bar examination, she was turned down by every firm where she applied to become a law clerk. She finally offered to work free for a year "to convince them that a woman could be a lawyer," she later recalled.         Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst took her up and after the year was up she was offered a permanent job. But she decided instead to work for indigent clients and family planning groups.         Three decades later, she was a leading candidate to become the Postmaster of New York in 1958 but was vetoed by Federal officials. The New York Times reported, based on officials close to the Postmaster General, "Opposition to the appointment of Mrs. Caroline K. Simon was based on the ground that the job was unsuited to a woman."         In a widely quoted speech the next year, she said: "There are four things a woman needs to know. She needs to know how to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog." Worked Under Dewey         Her public service began in the 1930's when she was instrumental in changing state laws to entitle women to serve as jurors and was herself among the first called for service.         District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of Manhattan named her to a panel on revising the Domestic Relations Court Act. During World War II she served as the Office of Civilian Defense's director of group activities in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.         Mr. Dewey, by then Governor, appointed her to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board in 1944-45 and the temporary State War Council's Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1943-45.         Eager to continue the fight against discrimination, she helped draft the nation's first state law on job bias based on race, religion or nationality and became a founding member of the resulting State Commission Against Discrimination. City Council Race         In 1956, Gov. W. Averell Harriman, a Democrat, appointed her to the new State Youth Commission.         The next year she ran for City Council President as a Republican. Although she lost to Abe Stark by about two-to-one, she still ran some 100,000 votes ahead of her ticket and received the biggest total for a citywide Republican candidate.         In 1958 she served as the legal advisor to the American delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         In 1959 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, inducted her as New York's Secretary of State, the second woman to hold that post. It was in that role that she issued the nation's first regulations against block busting, in which brokers manipulated property owners' fears about racial or ethnic changes in the neighborhood to provoke sales.         It was her marriage to Leopold K. Simon, a lawyer, that ignited her interest in the law.         They divorced in the early 1950's. She remarried, to Irving W. Halpern, the chief probation officer of the Court of General Sessions, who died in 1966.         Her survivors include her son, Lee K., of Wilmington, N.C.; a daughter, Cathy Prince of White Plains; a brother, Nathan F. Klein of Titusville, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         A service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street in Manhattan.       
         Madeleine Marshall Simon, a singing coach and concert pianist who taught English diction at the Juilliard School of Music for over half a century, died on Sunday at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from a heart attack, said her grandson, J. Kirby Simon.         Mrs. Simon, whose professional name was Madeleine Marshall, was author of "The Singer's Manual of English Diction," which has been a standard guide on the subject since 1953.         Reviewing her book in The New York Times, Howard Taubman wrote: "What all the advice aims at is the eternal one of learning to make technique the servant of art. As Miss Marshall sums it up, articulation should be 'so persuasive that no one will be conscious of method.' " On the Juilliard Faculty         She joined Juilliard in 1935 as an instructor in English diction and retired in 1986, after providing generations of singers with the tools of being understood, while performing in English. She also trained many teachers of English diction at schools and colleges.         Over the years, she was coach and accompanist for many artists, including Lily Pons, Helen Traubel, Leontyne Price, Lawrence Tibbet and Lauritz Melchior.         Mrs. Simon was on the staff of the School of Sacred Music of Union Theological Seminary for 20 years. She also worked on special assignments for the Metropolitan Opera and the Robert Shaw choral organization.         Born in Syracuse, she was a graduate of Syracuse University. She began her career as a concert pianist and performed as soloist with the New York Philharmonic under Arturo Toscanini and other conductors.         She was married to Robert A. Simon, a music critic for The New Yorker, who died in 1981.         In addition to her grandson, she is survived by a son, John G. Simon of New Haven; a daughter, Peggy Traktman, and a sister, Helen Marshall Borchard, both of New York City, and another grandchild.       
         Sophia Yarnall Jacobs, a lifelong advocate of civil and human rights, died on Wednesday at her home on Mount Desert Island in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 91.         Her daughter, Charlton Yarnall Phelps, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Mrs. Jacobs was former president of the Urban League of Greater New York and the National Council of Women. She was active in the Urban League movement for more than 20 years and served as vice president and trustee of the National Urban League.         As head of the league's chapter for Greater New York from 1955 to 1960, she fought school segregation, pressed for more public housing on vacant land sites and led action for legislation barring racial discrimination in private housing.  Headed Women's Council         In 1959, Mrs. Jacobs took part in the first "woman-to-woman" exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. She became president of the National Council of Women in 1960 and was chairwoman of the 75th anniversary of the International Council of Women and the national affiliate, in Washington in 1963.         Born in Haverford, Pa., she attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. In 1921, she married Reginald Robert Jacobs, a Philadelphia banker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1937.         While in Philadelphia, she wrote many articles of interest to women, published in Good Housekeeping, Country Life, Harper's Bazaar, Parents, Reader's Digest and other magazines. From 1937 to 1945, she served as executive secretary of the Philadelphia Orchestra Club and then became promotion manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wrote Historical Novel         In 1945, she went to San Francisco as an observer at the birth of the United Nations.         Mrs. Jacobs moved to New York in 1954, where she was an officer of numerous civic and educational organizations. She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Committee on Africa, Howard University, Planned Parenthood-World Population and the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living Environment.         She was the author of a historical novel, "The Clark Inheritance," based on her family's history in the develpment of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. She is remembered by many as Sophy, the group leader, in her friend Emily Kimbrough's book, "Pleasure by the Busload."         Besides her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Denholm Muir Jacobs of Northeast Harbor; 6 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.

         Elisabeth Draper, an interior designer in New York for 60 years, died in her sleep at her home in Manhattan on Monday. She was 93.         John R. Taylor Jr., one of Mrs. Draper's grandnephews, said she had been in declining health for the last four years.         Mrs. Draper was one of the grande dames of decorating in an era when a professionally decorated home was a mark of privilege.         She became known for comfortable rooms that mixed antiques with contemporary furnishings.         In 1967, she said: "I came along in that lovely ladies' era of decorating and just before all the talented men began emerging in the field."         Self-taught, Mrs. Draper was responsible for the decor of countless country houses, city apartments and houses as well as executive suites in banks.         She was born Elisabeth Carrington Frank in New York City in 1900, the daughter of Charles and Louise Frank. Mr. Frank was a banker. She attended Miss Spence's School but left before her graduation in 1918 to be trained as a radio operator 1st class, and served in that capacity until the end of World War I. Eisenhowers Were Clients         Soon after the war, she married Seth Low, a banker. When the couple were divorced in 1929, Mrs. Draper began her career in decorating with her sister Tiffany Taylor, establishing a firm called Taylor & Low.         In 1935, she married Dr. George Draper, an internist and specialist in psychosomatic medicine. In 1936, Mrs. Draper established her business under her own name.         Mrs. Draper was prominent in the Long Island social world for decades. President and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower were among her numerous clients.

She decorated the American Embassy in Paris for Ambassador Amory Houghton, worked on a number of rooms at the White House, and did the interiors of Blair House. The Old Merchant's House on East Fourth Street in Manhattan was restored under her direction.         Mrs. Draper is survived by her son, Seth Low Jr., of Syosset, L.I., and her stepdaughter, Penelope Buchanan of Cleveland.         The funeral will be tomorrow at 11 A.M. at St. James's Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Joyce Haber, known for her barbed commentaries as one of the last of Hollywood's powerful gossip columnists and the author of a best-selling book on the movie industry, died on Thursday at a hospital in Los Angeles.  Her age was variously given as 60 or 62.         The cause was kidney and liver failure, said a spokesman for the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.         Miss Haber and her syndicated column played a role in a sensational case in the 1970's that involved the actress Jean Seberg, who suffered a premature labor and later committed suicide.         In 1968, The Los Angeles Times named Miss Haber as a successor to Hedda Hopper, who had died in 1966. Louella Parsons, a rival Hollywood columnist for the Hearst papers, had retired in 1965.         Miss Haber once described Melina Mercouri as having "wall-to-wall hips, an ear-to-ear smile and more teeth than a pretzel has salt." She said Julie Andrews had "a kind of flowering dullness about her."         Miss Haber retired as a columnist to write "The Users" (Delacorte, 1976), a best-selling novel. Its passages on the exploits of 70 real and fictional Hollywood characters disturbed even some of her friends and sources. Role in Seberg Case         The Seberg episode started in 1970 when Miss Haber wrote about "the baby Miss A is expecting and its father." The column said: "Papa's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther."         Three months later, Newsweek named Miss Seberg, a white actress, as the expectant mother. The day after reading that, she went into premature labor. The baby girl died three days later. Miss Seberg and her husband, Romain Gary, a French novelist and former diplomat, sued Newsweek and settled for several thousand dollars.         It was later disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had plotted to plant the rumor in a campaign to discredit and harass radicals, whom Miss Seberg had supported. But the agency's files said that J. Edgar Hoover had temporarily delayed the plan when the Haber column item mysteriously appeared.         Mr. Gary said Miss Seberg became despondent and tried to commit suicide on the anniversaries of the baby's death. Eventually she killed herself in 1979. Mr. Gary, who blamed the F.B.I. for her troubles, committed suicide in 1980, although the reason was unclear.         Miss Haber said that her report was based on a letter given to her by an editor, whom she did not name, and that she had not been aware of any F.B.I. involvement.         Miss Haber was a child of the movie industry. As a six-year-old, she acted in three "Our Gang" features. She was educated at Brearley School, Bryn Mawr College and Barnard.         After working briefly in summer stock theater, as a political campaign aide and at an advertising agency, she joined Time magazine as a researcher.         She was divorced from Douglas S. Cramer Jr., a television and film producer.         Her survivors include a son, Douglas 3d, and a daughter, Courtney Cramer.       
         Helen Kaplan, who devoted her life to helping retarded children and making the public aware of their needs, died on Wednesday at Central General Hospital in Plainview, L.I. A resident of Old Westbury, she was 82.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Kaplan was a founder and charter member of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, Nassau County Chapter. She served as its secretary, vice president and president, and finally, from 1961 until 1988, as its executive director. After that, she continued to attend functions and maintained an active interest in the organization until her death.         In the late 1940's retarded children had few opportunities in education, training or recreation. This led to the birth of the association in New York City in 1949. News quickly spread to Long Island and the Nassau chapter sprang up the same year. Son Died of Leukemia         Mrs. Kaplan's first child, David, was retarded, and died of leukemia at the age of 9 in 1952, two years after she opened the fledgling association's first day camp for 24 children. In 1950 she started a demonstration training program, which she ran for eight years.         She became the guiding force behind the growth of the Nassau Association for the Help of Retarded Children, whose more than 8,000 members support educational, vocational, residential and other programs to serve 1,400 children and adults and their families. She spent 11 years as a full-time volunteer until the death of her husband, Allan, in 1960, when she joined the salaried staff.         The New York association now has chapters in nearly every county and sister organizations across the country. The statewide group, Nysarc Inc., belongs to the Arc of the United States.         Mrs. Kaplan grew up in Philadelphia. She graduated from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and was an accomplished pianist.         She sat on several influential committees and received many honors. Among them was the first Helen Award, created by a State Commissioner of Mental Health, Alan Miller, and named after her.         Mrs. Kaplan is survived by another son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Arlene Streit Yagoda, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred race horses, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Woodmere, L.I.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Carrying on a family tradition, she raced horses throughout the country with her husband, and their son Aaron became a handicapper, starting at the age of 8. The columnist Red Smith wrote about a typical day at Aqueduct when Aaron, then 10, picked six winners, the daily double and an exacta.         Mrs. Yagoda, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Hofstra University. Her grandfather, Aaron, founded the Streit Matzoh Company.         She was married for 30 years to Stanley Yagoda, who was president of the Hot Dogger clothing company.         Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Ruth and Jack Streit of Brooklyn; two sons, Phillip, of Manhattan, and Aaron, of Manhattan and Hallendale, Fla., and two sisters, Myrna Heilbrun of Manhattan and Nettie Streit of Brooklyn.         Correction:  August 21, 1993, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about an owner and breeder of thoroughbred horses rendered her first name incorrectly, as did the headline. She was Arlyne (not Arlene) Streit Yagoda.       
         Florence Baker Martineau, long active in the New York Heart Association and other charitable organizations, died yesterday in Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Martineau had been visiting a friend in Washington, Conn., when she entered the hospital. The cause of her death was complications from bronchial pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Martineau was a supporter of the Muscular Dystrophy Research Fund at Children's Hospital in Boston.         Born in Manhattan, she was a daughter of George F. Baker Jr., a banker, and the former Edith Brevoort Kane. She was a granddaughter of George F. Baker, a director of 43 banks and corporations. Mrs. Martineau graduated from what is now called the Hewitt School and Sarah Lawrence College.  She lived in Washington, Conn., before moving to Palm Beach nine years ago.         Her marriage in 1932 to Thomas Suffern Tailer, a sportsman, ended in divorce. In 1941 she married Stanley Martineau, a sculptor whose works included a bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Mr. Martineau died in 1977.         Mrs. Martineau is survived by 2 daughters from her first marriage, Fern de Narvaez of Palm Beach and Wendy Holt of Cool, Calif.; a son from her second marriage, Michael, of Granville, Mass.; 9 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Lucinda Ballard, the Broadway costume designer, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Miss Ballard won the first Tony Award for costume design, in 1947, for her work on several productions in that season: "Happy Birthday," "Another Part of the Forest," "Street Scene," "John Loves Mary" and "The Chocolate Soldier." She won another Tony in 1962 for "The Gay Life."         In 1945, she won a Donaldson Award, a prestigious theatrical prize that is no longer given, for the nostalgic costumes she designed for "I Remember Mama." In 1951, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the film "A Streetcar Named Desire." Correcting an Omission         Miss Ballard was an energetic champion of the costume designer's importance to a play. She was known for her skillful use of color, and Elia Kazan also noted her talent for visualizing in advance how the costumes in a play would look together, when they were seen by the audience.         Writing in 1987 about Miss Ballard's role in the history of theatrical costume design, Jeanne T. Newlin, the curator of the Harvard Theater Collection of the Harvard College Library, said: "The costume designer waited far too long for full professional appreciation. No one in the modern American theater has done more to resist this omission and force open the eyes of the producer, the director and, best of all, the playwright than Lucinda Ballard."         Miss Ballard once described herself, with some understatement, as "a theatrical designer who was quite successful and was noticed, especially for making historical costumes look human rather than museumish."         Her first theater credits were as the scenic and costume designer for a 1937 production of Shakespeare's "As You Like It" at the Ritz Theater in New York. She retired in 1962, but came back in 1985 to design the costumes for a revival of Tennessee Williams's "Night of the Iguana." Born in New Orleans         Miss Ballard, whose given name was Lucinda Davis Goldsborough, was born in New Orleans, the daughter of Richard Goldsborough and the former Anna Farrar. She attended Miss McGehee's School in New Orleans and the Art Students League in New York. She also studied in Paris and elsewhere in France.         She married William F. R. Ballard in 1930; they were divorced in 1938. In 1951, she married Howard Dietz, who wrote the lyrics for more than 500 songs, and they lived for many years in Sands Point, L.I. He died in 1983.         Miss Ballard is survived by a son, Robert F. R. Ballard of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Liza Dietz Gard of London; six grandchildren, and two stepgrandchildren.       
         Alison Smithson, a British architect who was prominent in the modern movement, died on Monday in London. She was 65 and lived in London.         Miss Smithson worked in partnership with her husband, Peter, for the last 43 years. Their position in the history of architectural modernism was summed up in The New York Times in June by Herbert Muschamp, who wrote that with the passage of time, "the pioneers of the modern movement (Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe)" were still active and vocal, but were "joined in the forum by younger colleagues with ideas of their own (Peter and Alison Smithson, Louis Kahn, Aldo van Eyck)."         The Smithsons' first widely noted building, a large glass-and-steel school built in the early 1950's in Norfolk county in eastern England, was considered a paramount example of the formal, symmetrical style inspired by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969), the German-American who was a founder of modern architecture.         The Smithsons' other designs include the original Economist building in London, considered a prime example of modern British architecture, and a housing project in London's East End that used rough-cast concrete in an architectural idiom that became known as the New Brutalism.         In addition to her husband, whom she married in 1949, Miss Smithson is survived by a son and two daughters.       
         Alice Wicks Olson, who received an apology from President Gerald R. Ford years after her husband committed suicide following a secret Government drug experiment, died last Thursday in Frederick, Md. She was 77.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Nils Olson, a son.         Mrs. Olson's husband, Dr. Frank R. Olson, died in 1953 when he jumped from a 10th-floor window of the old Hotel Statler in New York. After a 20-year campaign by Mrs. Olson, Federal investigators started an inquiry into the circumstances of Dr. Olson's death.         That inquiry forced the Central Intelligence Agency to acknowledge in 1975 that her husband, a civilian chemist for the Army, had been an unwitting participant in an experiment in which people were given varying doses of LSD to observe their reactions.         In addition to apologies from President Ford and the Director of Central Intelligence, the family was awarded $750,000 by Congress.         After the death of her husband, Mrs. Olson counseled alcoholics and drug addicts in Frederick. The Alice Olson House, a center for women recovering from drug and alcohol addition, was named in her honor.         In addition to Dr. Nils Olson of Frederick, she is survived by another son, Eric W. Olson of Stockholm, and three grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Singer Morrell, co-founder of Morrell & Company, wine and liquor merchants in New York City, died on Thursday at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She and her husband, Samuel, founded the business in 1948. They were then joined by their children, Roberta and Peter. When their parents retired, the children took over the business on Madison Avenue.         In addition to her daughter and son, Mrs. Morrell is survived by four grandchildren.

Miss Ide was born and grew up in Springfield, Ill.She moved to New York to train as a dancer, studying at the Isadora Duncan school and performing with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman from 1930 to 1937. From 1946 to 1948 she was a principal dancer with the Jose Limon Dance Company, creating roles in "Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias" and "Day on Earth," both by Humphrey. "Letitia Ide looks like a young goddess and moves like one as well," John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1949.         Miss Ide was Mr. Limon's partner in several dances and later helped to recreate the dances for other companies. She is featured in a 1959 film of "Lament" and returned to the company to perform her role, the Figure of Destiny, in a 1964 revival of the dance. Miss Ide also choreographed occasionally.         She made her Broadway debut in 1930 as a leading dancer in "Lysistrata" and was featured in "As Thousands Cheer," "Life Begins at 8:40" and "Americana."         Miss Ide was married to Victor M. Ratner, who died in 1974.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Dr. Stephanie LaFarge of Hastings-on-Hudson; her companion, Len Tillett of Norwich, England; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

         Rita Karin, a stage, film and television actress who performed in both Yiddish and English, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ill with pneumonia, but no cause of death was listed on the death certificate, said her son, Dr. Michael Horowitz of Evanston, Ill.         Ms. Karin was born in Vilna, Poland, in 1919. During World War II, she studied at the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Her parents and other relatives in Poland were killed in the Holocaust. In 1945, she left the Soviet Union for Germany, where she narrated "The Mills of Death," the first United States Information Agency documentary on the liberation of the concentration camps.

         Alice S. Morris, for many years a figure on New York's literary scene, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was sudden respiratory failure, her family said.         From 1951 to 1968, Mrs. Morris was the literary editor of Harper's Bazaar. Herself a writer and critic of modern fiction, she helped to introduce many fresh American authors to the reading public.

         Jean Eckart, who designed sets with her husband, William, for many Broadway shows, including "Fiorello!" and "Damn Yankees," died on Monday at her home in Dallas. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband said.

They were associated especially with musicals, including "The Golden Apple," "Li'l Abner," "She Loves Me" and "Mame," and received a Donaldson Award and two Tony nominations.         They also did design work for television, notably for the 1957 CBS broadcast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella." In 1959, they were co-producers, as well as the designers, of "Once Upon a Mattress," which starred Carol Burnett. Their film work included "Damn Yankees," "The Pajama Game" and "The Night They Raided Minsky's." The Goal: 'Light and Airy'         "We tried to do things that were light and airy and that suited the character of each show," Mr. Eckart said yesterday. "In some ways, we were more interested in the movement of the scenery, and how that contributed to the show." In a review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described the Eckarts' work in "Once Upon a Mattress" as "effortless and cheerful -- a shining fairy-story production designed out of affection and good humor."         Mrs. Eckart, whose maiden name was Jean Levy, was born in Chicago on Aug. 18, 1921. She met her future husband, whom she married in 1943, when they were both students in New Orleans, and they attended the Yale School of Drama together. In 1971, the Eckarts moved to Dallas to teach at Southern Methodist University, while continuing to take on occasional free-lance design projects.         Mrs. Eckart received a master's degree in social work from the University of Texas and co-founded the Community Psychotherapy Center, a nonprofit institution in Dallas.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her brother, Edwin Levy of Topeka, Kans.; a half-sister, Linda Levy of Boulder, Colo.; a son, Peter, of San Francisco; a daughter, Julie Johnson of Norwalk, Conn., and a grandson, Travis Johnson, also of Norwalk.       
         Joan R. Sovern, a sculptor, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Michael, who stepped down in June as president of Columbia University.         Mrs. Sovern, who was born and grew up in Manhattan, majored in art at Bennington College. She later studied sculpture with William Zorach and John Hovannes at the Art Students League. Her early works were large abstract pieces in bronze, terra cotta and marble, but in recent years she turned to assemblage, making small, angular forms out of slate, stone and driftwood. She had solo exhibitions at the Nora Haime Gallery in 1988 and the Kouros Gallery in 1991.         Mrs. Sovern also served on the Columbia Art History Advisory Council and helped create the Henry Moore Sculpture Reserve at Columbia's campus in Harriman, N.Y.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Edward Rosenthal of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a daughter, Hannah Wit of Oakland, Calif.; a son, David Wit of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Julie Sovern of New York City and Elizabeth Sovern of Mount Kisco, N.Y.; two stepsons, Jeffrey Sovern of Queens and Douglas Sovern of Oakland, and four grandchildren.       
         Florence Small Gaynor, the first black woman to head a major teaching hospital in the United States, died on Sept. 16 at Christiana Medical Center in Newark, Del. She was 72.         She died unexpectedly after a sudden brain hemorrhage, said her son, Wardell.         Mrs. Gaynor, a registered nurse by training, rose through the ranks of administration at several large New York hospitals at a time when there were few women or blacks in such positions. In February 1971, she was chosen from a field of 20 candidates, the rest of them male, to be executive director of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, making her the first black woman ever to head one of the city's municipal hospitals.         Eighteen months later she accepted a job in New Jersey, as executive director of Martland Hospital in Newark, a 600-bed teaching hospital operated by the state's medical school. Now part of the the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, it was then the state's largest hospital. Struggle to Become Nurse         Born in Jersey City, the fourth of six girls, Mrs. Gaynor fought racial barriers from the time she graduated from high school, at the age of 15, to get training to become a nurse. The first nursing school where she applied, at Jersey City Medical Center, turned her down because it did not admit blacks.         She worked at a doll factory and at an electric plant to help support her family and then applied the nursing school at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated as a registered nurse in 1946 and worked first at Queens General Hospital.         After a stint as a public-health nurse in East Harlem for New York City's Health Department, she worked as head nurse at Francis Delafield Hospital in Washington Heights and as a school nurse with the Board of Education in Newark.         At the same time she was pursuing a bachelor's degree in nursing and then a master's degree in public health at New York University. She spent the summer of 1965 at the University of Oslo in Norway studying the Scandinavian health system.         When she returned, she pursued a career in hospital administration, starting in the pediatrics department of Lincoln Hospital, which is staffed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. After a series of promotions, she was named assistant administrator in 1970.         After heading Sydenham Hospital and Martland Hospital, she left the Northeast to serve from 1976 to 1980 as director of hospital and health services at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school that has produced many of the nation's black doctors.         From 1980 until 1984, she was director of the West Philadelphia Community Mental Health Consortium in Philadelphia. For two years, before she retired in Wilmington, Del., she worked again as a school nurse, in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Wardell Michael Gaynor of Brooklyn and Matthew Small Gaynor of Cincinnati; a daughter, Brenda L. Gainer of Wilmington; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Peggy Dennis, a Communist organizer and author, died on Sept. 25 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in San Francisco. She was 84.         The cause was complications from several strokes, said her son, Eugene Dennis Vrana.         Ms. Dennis was the wife of Eugene Dennis, general secretary of the American Communist Party from 1946 to 1959 and one of 12 American Communists jailed in the late 1940's for violating the Smith Act by conspiring to overthrow the Government. Ms. Dennis worked mostly in internal party organizing and for many years served as a courier of messages to Communist leaders in Germany, Poland, France and other countries.         After 1949, she worked primarily as a journalist at The Daily Worker and The People's World. She also wrote many freelance articles on politics and economics for socialist and liberal magazines including The Progressive and The Nation. She moved to San Francisco in 1961 after Mr. Dennis died.         In 1977, a year after she resigned from the Communist Party because of differences with its leadership, she wrote a book based on her experiences as an organizer, "The Autobiography of an American Communist: A Personal View of a Political Life."         A documentary about her life with Mr. Dennis, called "Love in the Cold War," was produced in 1991 by American Experience and Windfall Films and shown on public television in 1992.         Ms. Dennis is survived by two sons, Mr. Vrana of San Francisco and Timur Timofeev of Moscow, and a niece, Laura Bock of San Francisco.       
         Anne Thompson MacDonald, the founder of Recording for the Blind, a nonprofit organization that has put more than 80,000 books on tapes for blind and learning-disabled students since 1948, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Huntington, L.I. She was 96 and had lived in Manhattan.         She died in her sleep, said her daughter, Anne Thomas.         Mrs. MacDonald started the recording service while working for the Women's Auxiliary of the New York Public Library. She was inspired by a program that provided recordings for blind veterans attending college on the G.I. Bill of Rights.         She established a recording studio in a two-room office on West 44th Street in 1951 and became president of Recording for the Blind in 1952. That year, she persuaded friends to establish other studios in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Athens, Ga. Volunteer for Several Groups         The organization, now based in Princeton, N.J., has grown to 32 studios in 16 states, with about 4,000 volunteers making recordings of fiction and nonfiction books for students from the fifth grade to graduate school. Last year, about 33,000 people requested copies of the recordings.         Mrs. MacDonald began working as a volunteer for several organizations during World War II. She was appointed assistant director of the Nurses' Aide Corps of the American Red Cross in 1942 and later helped set up a program to house and feed British soldiers released from Japanese prison camps who stopped in New York on their way home.         In May 1988, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University for her volunteer work.         She was the wife of Ranald H. MacDonald, a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, who died in 1988.         She is survived by her son, Ranald H. Jr. of Denver; her daughter, Anne M. Thomas of Locust Valley, L.I.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Sibley, a fashion designer whose work is included in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 52.         The cause was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, said her husband, Peter Powell.         Ms. Sibley started her career in a small design studio she established on East 58th Street in Manhattan. She founded Sibley Coffee Ltd. with a fellow designer, Dory Coffee, in 1966. The company's popular silk jersey body dresses were sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and private customers included Jacqueline Onassis, Babe Paley and Candice Bergen.         Born in Gipsy, Pa., she attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and received a fellowship to travel and study in Europe, where she attended design classes at the Sorbonne.         Sibley Coffee was made a part of the Bendel's Studio Group in 1973 and closed in 1977. Ms. Sibley went on to work as associate designer for Ellen Tracy until 1980, when she left to work as a display designer and sales representative for Yale Burg, an antiques importing company in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband and a son, Gus Powell, who attends Oberlin College in Ohio.       
         Fran Carlon, an actress who worked in radio, television, films and theater, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Casey Allen.         Miss Carlon began her career in the early 1930's, playing Little Eva in a touring company of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." She went on to Hollywood and acted in films with Loretta Young, Douglas Montgomery and the Ritz Brothers before turning to radio drama, appearing in shows like "Lorenzo Jones" and "Our Gal Sunday." She also played Lorelei Kilbourne on the radio show "Big Town."         Her Broadway credits included "Sunrise at Campobello" and "Men of Distinction." On television, she played the title character on "Portia Faces Life" and was Julia Burke for six years on "As the World Turns."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Kim Allen of Minneapolis; a son, Kerry Allen of New York City; a sister, Mary Behr, and two grandchildren.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Josephine Jablons, a board member of the New York City Opera Company, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69 and also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Jablons helped found the City Opera Guild in 1959 and for six years served as its president. She led it when the opera celebrated its new home at Lincoln Center with a lavish gala in 1966. She had been on the board of the City Opera since its days at City Center on West 55th Street. She was elected a director of the City Opera Company in July.         A native of Albany and a graduate of Skidmore College, Mrs. Jablons began her career in journalism and public relations. She spent 14 years as a reporter and editor of The New York Herald Tribune in Paris and in New York, covering travel, society, the arts and other subjects.         She also took part in Democratic Party affairs. She was active recently in several organizations helping immigrants.         She is survived by her husband, J. Mitchell Jablons; a daughter, Pamela Jablons of Manhattan; a son, Dr. David Jablons of San Francisco, and a sister, Grace Burke of Colonie, N.Y.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Aimee Mott Butler, a philanthropist who was a daughter of a founder of the General Motors Corporation, died on Thursday at her home in St. Paul. She was 91.         The cause was complications after a stroke, said a son, Peter Butler of St. Paul.         Mrs. Butler was the daughter of Charles Stewart Mott, who at the turn of the century became the largest stockholder in General Motors. She graduated from Vassar College and after her marriage founded the Aimee and Patrick Butler Family Foundation with her husband. Over the years the St. Paul philanthropy has provided financial support to schools, colleges, museums and alcoholism treatment centers.         Her husband died three years ago. Among Mrs. Butler's survivors is a half-brother, Stewart Mott of New York.       
         Tatyana Nikolayeva, a Russian pianist widely respected for her interpretations of the music of Bach and Shostakovich, died on Monday in San Francisco. She was 69 and lived in Moscow.         The cause was a cerebral aneurism, said Jacques Leiser, her American manager. Miss Nikolayeva suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during a recital on Nov. 13 at the San Francisco Music Center. Stricken again soon afterward, she lost consciousness permanently. She was being treated at the California-Pacific Medical Center when she died.         Miss Nikolayeva was born on May 4, 1924, in Bezhitz, near Bryansk. She began piano study at the age of 5 with her mother. Her principal teacher was the renowned Aleksandr Goldenweiser, at the Moscow Conservatory, where she subsequently taught. Shared With Shostakovich         In 1950, she gained international recognition by winning a piano competition at the Leipzig Bach Festival. She impressed the jury, which included the composer Dmitri Shostakovich, by offering to play not merely the Bach prelude and fugue required, but any of the 48 preludes and fugues of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier," from memory.         Shostakovich was so taken with her performances that on his return to Moscow he wrote his own set of 24 Preludes and Fugues (Op. 87), sharing each of the pieces with her as it was finished. She gave the work's premiere, in 1952 in Leningrad, and developed a close friendship with the composer. Having also studied composition at the Moscow Conservatory, she herself became a composer as well as a performer.         "As time passes," Miss Nikolayeva wrote a few years ago of her Leipzig award, "I feel more and more that I received then another, not so concrete but no less important, prize: the creative and personal friendship of Dmitri Shostakovich; a friendship which lasted more than 25 years, to the day of his death."         Miss Nikolayeva began to appear regularly in the West only late in life. She made her American debut in 1992, with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. She gave her New York debut recitals on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 this year, playing the Shostakovich preludes and fugues at the 92d Street Y. She went on to play Bach and Shostakovich in Philadelphia, and she was playing the complete set of preludes and fugues again in San Francisco when she was stricken.         She recorded the Shostakovich preludes and fugues three times, twice for Melodiya and most recently for Hyperion. She also recorded many keyboard works of Bach for Melodiya and other labels.         She is survived by a son, Kirill, who lives in Moscow.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973. Mrs. Judge is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Judge Howes of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jeremy of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Marian Bruce Logan, a civil rights advocate, former New York City Commissioner of Human Rights and a cabaret singer in her youth, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. She was 73.         The cause was emphysema, her son, Warren Arthur Logan, said.         Mrs. Logan was an associate of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a campaign aide for several political figures, including Nelson A. Rockefeller, Robert F. Kennedy and Robert F. Wagner.         Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed Mrs. Logan to head the Commission on Human Rights in 1977. During her two-year tenure she worked to stop the practice of redlining, by which banks and savings and loan institutions refuse to make mortgage loans to residents of certain areas. Efforts on West Side         Along with her husband, Dr. Arthur C. Logan, a surgeon, she was involved in efforts to stabilize the West Side as an integrated community during urban-renewal efforts there.         Mrs. Logan was a socially prominent fund-raiser who generated financial backing for both national and local civil-rights issues and causes, particularly those of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.         Mrs. Logan was at one time the only Northern board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She also raised money for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Urban League.         In 1971 the Citizens Union presented Dr. and Mrs. Logan with awards for outstanding public service for their prominence in campaigning for civil rights and better public health.         During her career in show business she sang using the stage name Marian Bruce. In the 1940's and 1950's she starred in the first all-black show to be presented in a Miami Beach nightclub.  She also sang in Europe.         Mrs. Logan's husband died previously. She is survived by her son, who lives in Manhattan, and a sister, Esther Harris of Philadelphia.       
         Claudia McNeil, an actress known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "A Raisin in the Sun," died on Thursday in the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 77 and had lived in the home for nine years.         The cause was complications of diabetes, said Rita Madero, a friend.         At the opening of "A Raisin in the Sun," by Lorraine Hansberry, in 1959 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Miss McNeil won praise for her heroic performance as the matriarch in a black family on the South Side of Chicago. Critics found that Miss McNeil imbued that simple character with nobility of spirit. Film and Musical Versions         Miss McNeil went on to be a member of what has been lauded by critics as the outstanding cast of the 1961 film of "A Raisin in the Sun," directed by Daniel Petrie. The introspective movie, confined largely to one room, was found to be as fine as the play.         On the screen, Miss McNeil was stolid, voluminous and serene as a mother trying to control her son and wanting to buy her family a respectable home.         She was also was praised as bringing a commanding presence to a 1981 production of the musical "Raisin," presented by Equity Library Theater.         In the 1959 production, she weighed nearly 300 pounds, as she did in a television production of "The Member of the Wedding." But by 1978, when she sang at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, she had slimmed down to 159 pounds and observed, "I lost a whole person."         Until then, she had not sung in New York since she appeared in Langston Hughes's "Simply Heavenly" in 1957. Before then, she had been a slender dancer and singer.         Miss McNeil was born in Baltimore. She became a licensed librarian and early in her carer sang in vaudeville theatres and on the radio as well as in nightclubs. She made her legitimate New York stage debut in 1953, when she began playing Tituba in "The Crucible" at the Martin Beck Theater. She also appeared in the 1959 film "The Last Angry Man."         Early in her career, before she reached Broadway in "Simply Heavenly," she sang in Harlem and Greenwich Village and on 52d Street. She also toured with the Katherine Dunham troupe.         Ms. Madero said that Miss McNeil was married when she was 18 to a man who died in World War II, and that her second marriage ended in divorce after two years.       
         Joan Weidemann Harris, a retired Brooklyn community worker and former board member and executive director of the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, died on Thursday at her home in Warren, Conn. She was 63 and also lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Harris was a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work. Over the years, she worked at the Maimonides Community Mental Health Center, the Mayor's Office for the Aging, community groups assisting the elderly and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In the 1980's she worked at the Private Industry Council.         During her years in Brooklyn she was active on community boards, including those of the Colony South Brooklyn Houses, the Brooklyn Heights Association and the Brooklyn Teen-age Pregnancy Network.         Mrs. Harris is survived by her husand of 40 years, James T.; a daughter, Karen H. Weidemann of Korsor, Denmark; a son, Christopher T. of Medford, Mass., and a grandson.       
         Alice Basto Tondel, coordinator of the Harvard University Band for 37 years, died on Thursday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 80 and a lifelong resident of Cambridge.         She died of respiratory failure, said Thomas Everett, the band's director.         Mrs. Tondel was an unpaid volunteer who traveled on road trips with the band, edited its Bass Drum Journal and offered counsel to students. The band will pay tribute to Mrs. Tondel today before the start of the Harvard-Penn game at Harvard Stadium.         Mrs. Tondel graduated from Wheelock College in Boston and was an artist in the Boston area for many years, maintaining a graphic arts business.         She is survived by a son, Mark Tondel of Lee, Mass.       
         Anne Spencer Lindbergh, a writer and the elder daughter of the aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, died Friday at her home in Thetford Center, Vt. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Noel Perrin.         Ms. Lindbergh was one of six children of her famous parents; she was born eight years after the kidnapping and killing of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.         She grew up in Darien, Conn., and, after studying at Radcliffe College for three years, moved to Paris to continue her education. While there she met and married a fellow student at the Sorbonne, Julien Feydy, who became a political scientist and university professor. They later divorced.         She later married Jerzy Sapieyevski, a composer and conductor she met in Europe and with whom she moved to Washington. They also divorced.         In her career as a writer, Ms. Lindbergh wrote 14 books, most of them for children. Her two most recent works are "Three Lives to Live" and "Travel Far, Pay No Fare." She was the recipient of several honors for her work, including an award from the International Reading Association.         Two of her more popular books are "The People in Pineapple Place" and "The Prisoner of Pineapple Place," both written in Washington, where she was then living. Many of the scenic backgrounds were taken from areas in Georgetown close to her home. She also taught school in Washington.         She moved to Vermont in 1987, and the next year she married Mr. Perrin, a writer and professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College. Ms. Lindbergh also taught for several years at the Riverside School in Lyndonville, Vt.         Ms. Lindbergh's mother, who is a poet and essayist, lives in Darien and Barnet, Vt. Her father died in 1974 at his home in Hawaii.         Ms. Lindbergh is also survived by a daughter, Constance Feydy, and a son, Marek Sapieyevski, both of Thetford Center; two step-daughters, Elisabeth Perrin, of Seattle and Amy Perrin, of White River Junction, Vt.; a sister, Reeve Tripp, of Barnet, and three brothers, Jon, of North Bend, Wash., Land, of Missoula, Mont., and Scott, of Brasilia. Brazil.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades.         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929.         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas: "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget B movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit.

         Dolli Tingle Brackett, an artist and designer of Christmas stamps for the Postal Service, died on Dec. 11 in Norwalk Hospital, Norwalk, Conn. She was 82.         The cause of death was respiratory failure, her son, Gordon Brackett, said.         Mrs. Brackett lived in Westport, Conn., for 47 years, and also had a winter residence and studio in Sarasota, Fla. Known professionally as Dolli Tingle, she exhibited her oils and watercolors in many museums and galleries on the East Coast.         In 1973, using needlepoint, she designed one of most popular stamps issued by the Postal Service, a depiction of a Christmas tree decorated with traditional ornaments, which drew upon memories of her childhood in Chicago. It took her 10 days to complete her needlepoint design using two strands of wool.         For her work on the Christmas stamp she was voted Woman of the Year by the American Needlepoint Guild. In all, she designed eight Christmas stamps for the Postal Service.         Mrs. Brackett, who studied at the Chicago Academy of Fire Arts, was also a painter who exhibited nationally, as well as a designer of books and rugs.         She is survived by her husband of 53 years, Ward Brackett of Westport, a portrait painter who also designs stamps for the Postal Service, and her son, Gordon Brackett of Ridgefield, Conn.       
         Adele Earnest, one of the founders of the Museum of American Folk Art, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Wash. She was 92.         In 1961 Mrs. Earnest was one of a group of six founding trustees of the museum and helped its early development at 2 Lincoln Square in Manhattan.         She made several significant donations and contributions, including an 1840 weather vane depicting Archangel Gabriel that became a symbol for the museum. She compiled two books, "The Art of the Decoy: American Bird Carving" and "Folk Art in America: A Personal View."         Mrs. Earnest was born in Waltham, Mass. She graduated from Wellesley College. In 1929 she was stage manager for Eva Le Gallienne's 14th Street Repertory Theater. In 1939 she established the Stony Point Art Gallery in Stony Point, N.Y., where she specialized in decoys and folk sculpture.         Mrs. Earnest's husband, Joel, died many years ago. She is survived by her son, Eugene, of Anacortes, Wash., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Marie H. Briehl, one of the country's earliest child psychoanalysts, died on Saturday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 96.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Dr. Briehl was director emeritus of the child analysis section at the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in Los Angeles.         Born in Czarist Russia, she came to this country as a toddler. She graduated from Hunter College and taught at Hunter College High School. Along with her husband, Dr. Walter Briehl, she received her psychoanalytic education in Vienna in the 1920's. She trained with Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund Freud and herself a founder of child analysis.         Returning to New York in 1930, Dr. Briehl resumed her teaching career and also started psychological and psychoanalytic treatment of children privately and at Mount Sinai Hospital. She became a full-time analyst in 1940.         Six years later, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where she established the training program for child analysis in the Southern California Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and worked as training and supervising analyst.         She became the first director of the institute's section on child analysis, serving for almost 20 years. She reached emeritus status in 1976 but continued to practice and teach in Los Angeles until moving back to New York in 1991.         Working in education, she helped found the Westland School in Los Angeles, a progressive school where she served as a consultant. She and her husband were active in human-rights causes, helping European analysts escape from Europe in the 1930's and establish themselves in the United States.         Her husband, a pioneer of group therapy methods, died in 1982. She is survived by a son, Dr. Robin Briehl of Lewisboro, N.Y.; a brother, Peter Hawley of Yonkers; two sisters, Elizabeth Delza Munson and Sophia Delza Glassgold, both of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.       
         Rita Klimova, a former dissident who served as Czechoslovakia's first Ambassador to the United States after the ouster of the Communist Government, died yesterday in a hospital in Prague. She was 62.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press, which quoted C.T.K., the official news agency of the Czech Republic. She had recently undergone treatment for leukemia.         Mrs. Klimova was diagnosed as having the disease shortly after she was named Ambassador to Washington in February 1990. She stepped down from the post in August 1992, less than four months before her country split into two nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.         After her retirement from the Czech diplomatic service last year, she lectured on Czech affairs at several universities, including the New School in Manhattan. Schooling in New York         Mrs. Klimova was born in Europe but spent part of her youth in Manhattan, where her family fled in 1939 after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her father, Batya Bat, was a journalist and writer who used the pen name Stanislav Budin.         She attended grade school and junior high school in New York. In 1946, her family returned to Czechoslovakia, where she attended high school and college.         Mrs. Klimova became a member of the Communist Party in 1948. She worked as a translator and taught political economics at Charles University in Prague.         She was dismissed from her university post after Soviet-led troops of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the liberal reforms of Alexander Dubcek.         She devoted her efforts to defending human rights and the political opposition, and she was expelled from the party in 1970. In 1989 Mrs. Klimova became the spokeswoman for the peaceful revolution that toppled the Communist Government and elevated her fellow dissident, the playwright Vaclav Havel, to the presidency. Voice of the Revolution         When the Communist regime began to disintegrate in November of 1989, she nearly missed the big moment.         She had been in Hungary meeting with two Czechoslovak exiles, and she drove home on the night of Nov. 19. There she found a message from Mr. Havel saying he wanted to meet with her the next morning.         Arriving at his apartment, she found him facing television cameras and photographers. Mr. Havel had called a news conference to mobilize the anti-Communist opposition, and he wanted to be sure Mrs. Klimova would be there to convey his message in American English.         She sat down next to him and began interpreting. For the next several weeks, as the old order crumbled, hers was the English-language voice of the "Velvet Revolution," an expression that she coined.         She is survived by a son, Vladimir Mlynar, and a daughter, Michaela Barlova, both of Prague.
