         Nancy Walker, who played Rhoda's mother, McMillan and wife's housekeeper and a paper-towel-promoting waitress in television commercials, along with a string of brassy, loudmouthed cutups on Broadway, died yesterday at her home in Studio City, Calif. She was 69 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Frank Liberman, a family spokesman.         A long-faced, red-haired, petite actress, Miss Walker said she was never able to play what she called a "gray character."         "I don't understand it myself," she said in 1976, "but I have this effect on people, so when I walk onstage, they start laughing."         That is pretty much what happened when through a case of mistaken identity she got her big break on Broadway at age 19. Her father, who was an acrobat, asked his agent to send her to see the producer George Abbott, who was auditioning actors for a new comedy, "Best Foot Forward."  Genesis of a Comedian         She was introduced as Miss Walker -- Mr. Abbott and Richard Rodgers had been expecting a singer named Helen Walker -- and began belting out a song called "Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four." Mr. Abbott built up the "blind date" role in "Best Foot Forward" from five lines to a leading role, making her an instant success.         She knew from age 10, she said, that she wanted to be a performer. But she said she did not realize that she could be a comedian until she started getting laughs in "Best Foot Forward."         "After that," she said, "people just kept writing parts for me."         But she said it was not a case of art imitating life. "Not so talkative" was how she once compared herself with the chatty characters she played onstage and on television.         "I've always thought people who are on, offstage, save very little for onstage," she said in 1976. "You can't keep the mask on all the time: it flakes."         Miss Walker, whose name originally was Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born on May 10, 1922, in Philadelphia. Her father changed his name to Dewey Barto when he joined a vaudeville act called the Three Bartos. When Miss Walker was 3 weeks old, her mother went back on the vaudeville circuit herself, and Miss Walker slept backstage. She crawled out into the spotlight one night when she was 10 months old and stole the show.         After her success in "Best Foot Forward," M-G-M flew her to Hollywood and signed her to a seven-year contract. She appeared in the movie version of the play and in "Girl Crazy" and "Broadway Rhythm," playing variations of the blind-date character she had mastered on Broadway. She also appeared in "Lucky Me," which starred Doris Day and Robert Cummings.         On Broadway, she also starred as the jaded cabdriver Brunnhilde Esterhazy in "On the Town" in 1944 and later appeared in "Pal Joey," "Wonderful Town," "Look, Ma, I'm Dancin"' and "Do, Re, Mi," a spoof of the jukebox industry in which she played Phil Silvers's long-suffering wife. 'The Quicker Picker-Upper'         She was also the face that launched a million rolls of paper towels in television commercials beginning in the 1970's, saying: "Bounty. It's the quicker picker-upper."         She was not defensive about making commercials. "One minute's work done well is just as important as one hour," she said. "Look, if it were a bad minute, I'd feel terrible, because I get paid very well, and that would be cheating. I'm not cheating anybody. I mean, an artist is an artist no matter what he does. Besides, if I weren't doing those commercials well, I'd not have gotten on the Mary Tyler Moore show."         On "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," she played Rhoda Morgenstern's overbearing mother, and went on to a regular role when Valerie Harper, as Rhoda, got a series of her own. In 1974, when Rhoda was finally married after a long run as Miss Moore's unmarried best friend, all Rhoda and Joe wanted was a small ceremony before a justice of the peace. But as Rhoda's mother, Ida Morgenstern, Miss Walker was determined to have a slightly more elaborate ceremony in her Bronx apartment. Rhoda wanted no more than a dozen guests. Ida invited 79.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig, and their daughter, Miranda Craig who lives in Los Angeles.

The show "Rhoda" ended in 1978, after a five-year run. Miss Walker also appeared in the series "McMillan and Wife" from 1971 to 1976, playing a sassy housekeeper. She was also the host of "The Nancy Walker Show," which had a brief run in 1976.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig; a daughter, Miranda Craig, and a sister, Betty Lou Barto, both of Los Angeles.       
         La Lupe, a singer who was known during the late 1960's as the Queen of Latin Soul, died on Feb. 28 at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She was 53 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said.         La Lupe had a raspy voice and an uninhibited stage presence; she shook her long hair, shimmied in low-cut dresses and tossed her beads and shoes to the crowds. A string of hits she made with the bandleader Tito Puente in the mid-1960's established her as one of the most popular performers in Latin music.         La Lupe was born Lupe Victoria Yoli in Santiago, a village in Oriente Province in Cuba. At her parents' insistence, she earned a teaching degree, but she had also been winning local singing contests, and decided to go into performing. She married a singer in the trio Los Tropicuba; after her first performance, he said he thought she was having an epileptic fit. She soon divorced him and began working on her own, and by 1960 she was a leading performer in Havana nightclubs. She bought her own club, but after difficulties with the Fidel Castro Government -- "Castro take my club, my money, my car," she told Look magazine in 1971 -- she emigrated to the United States, and settled in New York in 1962. The Making of a Star         Soon after she arrived, she began singing with orchestras led by Mongo Santamaria and Mr. Puente, with whom she recorded a number of hit singles, including "Que Te Pedi." By the end of the 1960's, she was a star in her own right, working with Mr. Puente and with other bandleaders, and touring the United States and Latin America.         In the mid-1970's, her jobs in New York City dwindled, and she moved to Puerto Rico, where she played concerts and television programs. She returned to New York, but her career had declined and her second husband's medical expenses depleted her savings. By the early 1980's she was living on welfare. In 1984, while hanging a curtain, she fell, injured her spine and was paralyzed; not long afterward, an electrical fire burned down her house. She sang with Mr. Puente for the last time in 1985, from a wheelchair, at a concert to help pay her expenses.         According to Vernon Boggs's "Salsiology," a history of salsa in New York published by Excelsior and Greenwood, La Lupe regained her ability to walk after being blessed by an evangelical Christian preacher. She began singing Christian music, performing regularly at Iglesia Pentecostal el Fin Se Acerca (Pentecostal Church: The End is Near) in the Bronx. She also recorded a series of albums in salsa and Mexican styles with devotional lyrics.         She is survived by her son, Rene Camano, and her daughter, Rainbow Garcia, both of the Bronx.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died on Monday at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminiscences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues. While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor. Ignored for Years         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me": "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century." 'On the Outside Looking In'         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong documentary by a California film maker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominantly Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' "         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer. Lessons From the Family Cook         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may as well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941:         "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it." Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         She saw little room at the table for caution. In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Friede two years later.         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Knopf.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991. The Tablet of Her Mind         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say." she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren. A Delicious Meal Of a Bookish Kind         Here are nine of the better-known books written by M.F.K. Fisher over the course of six decades. She wrote a total of 15.         "The Gastronomical Me" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1943), collected essays.         "Here Let Us Feast (Viking, 1946), collected essays.         "Not Now But Now" (Viking, 1947), a novel.         "An Alphabet for Gourmets" (Viking, 1949), collected essays.         "The Physiology of Taste," (Heritage Press, 1949) an English translation of Brillat-Savarin's treatise.         "A Cordiall Water," (Little, Brown, 1961), folk cures.         "A Map of Another Town," (Little, Brown, 1964), reminiscence of years in Aix-en-Provence.         "With Bold Knife and Fork," (Putnam, 1968), collected essays.         "The Cooking of Provencal France," (Time-Life, 1968); Mrs. Fisher served as a consultant with Julia Child and Michael Field.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Dottie Green, the savvy, strong-armed catcher for the original Rockford (Ill.) Peaches, who dominated the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from its inception in 1943 to its demise in 1954, died on Monday at her home in Natick, Mass. She was 71 years old.         According to Mary Bond, the longtime friend who took care of her during her final illness, she died of cancer.         Although Miss Green had the same first name, and played the same position on the same team as the character portrayed by Geena Davis in "A League of Their Own," the 1992 movie based on the famous women's league, that was merely a coincidence, according to those familiar with the league and the movie, including Kelly Candaele, whose story was the basis of the movie. Handled Pitchers Well         "Dottie was a popular name back then and we had a lot of Dotties," said Dottie Collins, a former member of the Fort Wayne Daisies, who recalled Miss Green yesterday as a smart catcher who handled her pitchers well and had a dead-eye throw to second.         "I was a pitcher and I know catchers," said Mrs. Collins, who also serves as the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, the nonprofit organization that owns the rights to the league's name and emblems.         Dorothy M. Green, who was born in Natick, grew up as an all-round athlete and was captain of the girls' softball, basketball and field hockey teams in her senior year at Natick High School.         After graduation, she played semipro softball for the Olympettes, a women's team that played in Boston Garden.         When Philip K. Wrigley, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, decided to start a women's baseball league to keep up the nation's interest in the sport during World War II, Miss Green was one of several Olympettes recruited by the new league.         Assigned to the Rockford Peaches, one of the four teams that began play in 1943, she played four seasons, until a knee injury forced her to abandon her career. She was later a chaperone with the league. Rooted for the Red Sox         She became a recreation officer at the state prison for women at Framingham, Mass., and was captain of the guards when she retired several years ago.         According to Miss Bond, Miss Green was not a fan of major league baseball until later life, when she began rooting for the Red Sox.         "She thought the men were too slow," Miss Bond said. "She said she didn't care to watch them."         Miss Green is survived by a brother, John H. Green, and a sister, Beatrice Clews.       
         Several thousand friends, admirers and family members filled Riverside Church yesterday to celebrate the life and to mourn the death of Clara M. Hale, the woman who sheltered and raised hundreds of abandoned and orphaned children in her home.         The service, an afternoon of heart-felt tributes, seemed to offer solace to those who were most touched by her example. Mother Hale, as she was widely known, died last Friday of complications from a stroke. She was 87 years old.         "Our lady of inner-city royalty," was the title given her by Percy E. Sutton, the businessman and former Manhattan Borough President, who in 1975 helped Mrs. Hale find and renovate a Harlem brownstone on West 122d Street which became Hale House, only a half-dozen blocks from Riverside Church. His description prompted a string of "amens" that rippled through the listeners.         Standing amid the seasonal red and green of bright poinsettias and fragrant Christmas pines, Mr. Sutton and others recalled Mrs. Hale's capacity for loving each of her children, for placing mirrors at toddler's eye level in Hale House, for taking the frailest of babies into her own room overnight. 'We're Almost Home'         A noonday mist dampened the gray stone on the outside walls of the church facing the Hudson River along Riverside Drive, but inside, song from the lips of the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Gospel Choir seemed to reach up toward the rich blue of the church's stained glass windows.         "We're almost home," sang the 30-member choir, many of whom came of age, and mind, at Hale House. They swayed back and forth in red and yellow robes as they sang: "I'm so tired and weary, no more do I want to roam."         The service, which lasted 100 minutes, opened with a procession of so many politicians, community leaders and members of Mrs. Hale's extended family that it took more than 10 minutes for them just to file in and be seated. Mayor David N. Dinkins, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Yoko Ono were among those in the procession.         A coffin of light-colored poplar was wheeled to the front of the church during the service. Afterward, it was guarded by a detail of the Harlem Youth Marine Cadets outside before it was taken for burial. Mrs. Hale's family asked that the location be kept private.         "Woe to those who thought this woman old and frail," said Mayor Dinkins, who was greeted by a standing ovation when he went to the pulpit. "She had twice the stamina of most others.         "The best tribute we can give is to keep her legacy alive," he added, saying that efforts would be made to fulfill Mrs. Hale's wish to establish a hospice for dying children at Hale House. Quoting the poet Langston Hughes, he concluded: "Beautiful also are the souls of my people. Mother, may you rest in peace." 'Like She Knew'         Mr. Sutton recalled his fondest memory of Mrs. Hale, which was when she rose to acknowledge the applause she received from Congress in 1985, after being cited as a "true American hero" in a State of the Union address by President Ronald Reagan.         "She rose gently, with the smile she always gave, like she knew that she owned everything," Mr. Sutton said. He described her reluctance at first to appear with Mr. Reagan because the President, as Mr. Sutton put it, "was not being too kind to people in the neighborhood where she lived." She resisted the invitation with the excuse that she was ill, but after the White House insisted that her daughter, Lorraine, appear in her place, Mrs. Hale eventually gave in.         Among the day's speakers was the Rev. Carolyn Knight, Mrs. Hale's pastor at the Philadelphia Baptist Church.         "She touched children no one else would touch," Ms. Knight said. "She showed us that what children really need is a hug and a kiss and a smile.         "In this season, when much is spoken of angels sent from God, Mother Hale was an angel," she said.         Ms. Knight recalled speaking with Mrs. Hale in a quiet moment about a year ago.         "She said: 'Carolyn, do you believe God knows my way? Do you believe I will go to heaven when I die ?' "         Ms. Knight closed the service with a final goodbye, provoking tears in the eyes of many listeners: "Farewell, farewell, you gentle lovely lady, we shall meet again."       
         Helen Joseph, a white dissident who was repeatedly detained and harassed by the South African Government in a long struggle against apartheid, died today in a hospital here. She was 87.         She died of complications from a stroke she had suffered two weeks ago, news agencies reported.         Mrs. Joseph became prominent here as a symbol of white opposition to the racial policies of her adopted land in the years after World War II when apartheid gained legal force. In this way, she was ahead of most other white foes of the system of racial separation.         The Government responded in kind, for more than three decades placing the often-ailing, ever-defiant Mrs. Joseph under various forms of house arrest and issuing banning orders that prohibited her from receiving more than one visitor at a time.         She was also declared a "listed person," a punishment intended to prevent her from being quoted in any form.         Even when formally silenced, she never accepted the restrictions, imposed under the Suppression of Communism Act. "You can't silence yourself," she once told an interviewer.         In the ranks of anti-apartheid campaigners, Mrs. Joseph was a militant, an associate of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, who once referred to her as part of their "family." From Polite Background         It was not a role that her upbringing might have suggested. Born in Sussex in England in 1905, Helen Beatrice May Fennell seemed set for a middle-class English life. She graduated with an honors degree from the University of London in 1927 and went on to teach for three years in India.         Arriving in South Africa in 1931, she settled in Durban, married a dentist, and "threw herself into the life style of a socialite," as The Weekly Mail of Johannesburg said in 1986. "In those days," the profile of her added, "she was known as beautiful and flighty, leading a life of wining and dining and bridge parties."         Friends say her service as an information and welfare officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in World War II and a subsequent decision to become a social worker in Cape Town and Johannesburg exposed her to some of the realities of South Africa.         Divorced in 1948, she became a founder of the Congress of Democrats, the white wing of the African National Congress. In 1955, she was present for the adoption of the congress's Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a South Africa without racial discrimination.         The following year, Mrs. Joseph helped lead a march of 20,000 women on the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest the extension of laws requiring blacks to carry passes. She was arrested and charged with treason, and a year later was put under the first of a series of banning orders. Overcame Cancer         In 1961, Mrs. Joseph was acquitted of treason after a marathon trial. But from 1962 to 1971, as a banned person, she was not allowed to receive visitors on weekends or at night, or to socialize with more than one person at a time. The order was lifted when she entered a hospital for cancer treatment.         "I had a cancer operation and then I had a major heart attack," she told an interviewer, "and they must really have thought, 'This old girl can't go on much longer.' "         But she did go on, campaigning at English-language universities. In 1978, she was jailed again, this time for contempt after she refused to testify against Winnie Mandela.         In August 1983, she became a sponsor of the United Democratic Front, which orchestrated the protest campaign of the mid-80's on behalf of the still-outlawed African National Congress. The campaign led to international sanctions against South Africa and ultimately to President F. W. de Klerk's offer of political change and to Mr. Mandela's release in 1990.         By then some reforms had begun, including the lifting of racial restrictions in public places. It seemed that Mrs. Joseph had outlasted a legal system that persecuted her. But her age and health problems, like a painful infirmity from leg fractures, confined to a wheelchair. She was no longer strong enough to speak at rallies.         Nonetheless, when Mr. de Klerk conducted a referendum in March, seeking approval to continue talks toward nonracial democracy, Mrs. Joseph appeared in public to tell supporters that she was voting for changes she had sought for more than four decades.
