         Mary Wesley, the popular British author whose sensual and often bitingly witty novels were not published until she reached her 70's, died on Monday in Totnes, Devon, her hometown in rural southwest England. She was 90.         Born Mary Aline Mynors Farmar, an Army officer's daughter, she was a lifelong writer who made her debut in 1968 with two books of fiction for children, ''Speaking Terms'' and ''The Sixth Seal.'' But her first novel for adults, ''Jumping the Queue,'' did not appear until 1983.         It was written in the years after the death of her second husband, Eric Siepmann, a journalist she married in 1952 and whose name she kept for the rest of her life. (Known as Mary Aline Siepmann, she adapted her pen name from her great-grandmother's name, Wellesley.)         Her husband's death had left her nearly penniless, with a teenage son to raise. ''Jumping the Queue'' tells of a middle-aged widow contemplating suicide and reflecting on her life as she encounters a fugitive wrestling with the same decision.         The novel offered original characterizations, playful allusions to sex and comic seriousness. It was critically acclaimed and despite its morbid theme, drew readers to her work.         Books by Mary Wesley then appeared almost annually through the 1980's and into the 90's. They often dealt with growing up middle-class in England, but American readers sought them, too, and many are still in print in the United States. Her last, ''Part of the Scenery,'' was published last year in Britain.         Ms. Wesley created ''an idiosyncratic fictional world, a middle-class English world,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote, reviewing the novel ''Second Fiddle'' in The New York Times in 1989. Her books' ''bright comic surface belies a dark subtext of sin, incest, murder and betrayal,'' Ms. Kakutani wrote, adding that ''cuckoldry and sexual gamesmanship thrive in her novels, and a chilly air of malice (or at the very least manipulation) that's reminiscent of Muriel Spark's work hovers over her characters.''         Born in 1912, Mary Farmar attended Queens College in London and the London School of Economics and Political Science before marrying Charles Swinfen Eady, a baron, in 1937. The marriage ended in 1944. She worked in the War Office during World War II, and her later writings reflected her wartime experiences.         She was the mother of three sons: William Siepmann, from her second marriage, and Roger and Toby Eady, from her first.         Unfazed by her late-blooming popularity, she once said that her chief claim to fame was ''arrested development -- getting my first novel published at the age of 70.''       
         Françoise Giroud, a widely admired French journalist who co-founded the political weekly L'Express and later served as France's first minister of women's affairs, died Sunday in the American Hospital of Paris. She was 86.         Her daughter said the cause of death was head injuries suffered when she fell last week.         Ms. Giroud was a slim, elegant woman known for both her charming manner and her piercing commentaries on France, the status of women and life in general. She continued working until just days ago, writing a weekly column in Le Nouvel Observateur, serving on the jury of a leading literary prize and appearing frequently on television.         Ms. Giroud was not a militant feminist in the manner of, say, Simone de Beauvoir but, as both a pioneering journalist and editor and as a cabinet minister, she served as a role model for two generations of French women seeking a more prominent role in French society. She made a particular point of encouraging young women in journalism.         While women are now highly visible in both news organizations and politics, though, she also recognized that sexual equality did not yet exist in France. In a 1996 interview, she noted: ''It's an illusion to believe that, because there are women ministers, women play a role in public affairs. There have been enormous changes, positive changes, but women still have a long way to go.''         Born in Geneva on Sept. 21, 1916, to parents of mixed Russian and Turkish extraction, France Gourdji -- as she was then called -- began working at 16 as a stenographer and then became a script-girl for several French movie directors, including Marc Allégret and Jean Renoir. During World War II, she worked as a go-between for the French Resistance, but was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and imprisoned at Fresnes until liberation the following year.         After the war, she began her journalistic career in the monthly magazine Elle, rising quickly to the position of news editor. Then, in 1953, with Jean-Jacques Servan-Shreiber, she founded L'Express, France's first American-style news weekly, and served as its news editor and later as editor. One measure of its influence is that the founding editors of its two competitors today, Le Nouvel Observateur and Le Point, came from L'Express.         During the 1950's, Ms. Giroud was married briefly and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, Caroline Eliacheff.         In 1974, during the center-right presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, she was named to the new post of minister of women's affairs by Jacques Chirac, who was prime minister at the time. She moved to the culture minister's job and held it until the following year.         In 1981, her own political views moved to the left: rather than backing either Mr. Giscard d'Estaing or Mr. Chirac, she endorsed the Socialist candidate, François Mitterrand, in his successful effort to win the presidency.         Ms. Giroud never returned to politics, but her weight as a commentator gave her considerable political influence. She also became a prolific author of biographies, including those of Marie Curie and Alma Mahler, and of books of political and personal reflection. In one of her first, ''The Comedy of Power'' (1977), she recounted her experience in government. In 1997, she published her autobiography and, in 2001, a collection of essays, ''Profession Journalist.''         Only one of her books, ''Si Je Mens,'' was published in the United States, in 1974, as ''I Give You My Word'' (Harcourt), but it is no longer in print.         Her books had a loyal readership in France, not least because they were packed with well-aimed commentaries on life.         ''God, how the French love rules,'' she noted in one book, ''The Rumor of the World.'' ''They put them everywhere, even where they have no place: in literature.''         In ''Journal of a Parisian,'' she offered, ''Indifference is an ailment of the spirit and the heart.'' In the same book, she concluded: ''Youth is short. It is life that is long.''       
         Evelyn Abrams Mauss, whose lifelong political activism began when she organized the Junior International League for Peace and Freedom as a 14-year-old in 1929, died on Saturday at the Peninsula Hospital Center in Queens. She was 87 and lived in the Neponsit section of Queens.         She had passed out leaflets opposing an American attack on Iraq in Manhattan earlier and apparently suffered a heart attack on her return to Queens, her family said.         At her death, Dr. Mauss, a retired New York University physiologist, remained active in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She was on the executive committee of the New York chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility and had an office at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, where she was a consultant.         A native of Manhattan, she was the granddaughter and daughter of league members and suffragists. Her father was Morris Abrams, a manufacturer and philanthropist. She graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1936 and received her doctorate in science from Johns Hopkins University three years later.         She is survived by her husband of 64 years, Dr. Irving Mauss; two sons, Steven and Peter, and a daughter, Susan Tunick, all of New York City; two brothers, Dr. Herbert L. Abrams of Neponsit and Mason Adams of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.       
         Irene Diamond, who after a successful career scouting scripts and talent in Hollywood became a major benefactor of the arts and medical research in New York City, died Tuesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 92.         At her death, she was president of the Irene Diamond Fund, which she established in 1994 to support, in particular, the performing arts and the fight against AIDS. The fund succeeded the Aaron Diamond Foundation, which she and her husband, a New York real estate developer, set up in the 1950's.         In the 1980's, the couple took an innovative step, deciding to pay out that foundation's considerable wealth over 10 years. They made the decision just before Aaron Diamond, developer of Roosevelt Island, died in 1984. (She liked to say that at the time they married, however, she made more money than her husband.)         Mrs. Diamond remained in control of the foundation after his death. Over the next decade, as planned, she oversaw the distribution of $220 million in about 700 donations, with more than $50 million earmarked for the fight against AIDS.         Among the foundation's top priorities was the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center for the City of New York, affiliated with Rockefeller University. There, in a laboratory building facing Bellevue Hospital Center, its director, Dr. David D. Ho, made crucial discoveries about the immune system's struggle with the AIDS virus.         Through her own fund, Mrs. Diamond invested heavily in New York institutions like Lincoln Center. Recent gifts include $1.2 million for Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home, now being built at the former Coliseum site, and large grants for the Dance Theater of Harlem, New York City Ballet and the New York Public Library.         She aided causes like gun control and AIDS programs in the public schools and gave $10 million to the Juilliard School for a program to attract gifted minority students and teachers.         President Bill Clinton recognized her philanthropy in 1999 with the National Medal of Arts, and in 2001 she received the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. She also sat on the boards of Young Concert Artists, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Human Rights Watch.         Irene Levine was born to immigrant parents in Pittsburgh, where she attended public schools. Hoping to be an actor, she took the name Irene Lee and studied repertory theater in Manhattan.         She did some modeling and freelance reading for Warner Brothers in New York before getting a job in Hollywood as an assistant editor in the studio's story division. At a meeting with the producer Hal B. Wallis, she began a 25-year collaboration in which she made recommendations on the work of as many as 32 writers. Some of the scripts that crossed her desk became classics, like ''The Maltese Falcon'' and ''Dark Victory.''         In 1941, back in New York, she read an unproduced play, ''Everybody Comes to Rick's,'' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It came with several rejection slips, but its theme of the tough but idealistic American and his bar in Morocco seemed to her a perfect fit for the world news of the day.         She persuaded Mr. Wallis to let her buy the play for $20,000 -- he gave it the name ''Casablanca'' -- and the movie, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, came out in 1943. It was just in time for the Allied invasion of North Africa and the Casablanca Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill.         After her marriage to Mr. Diamond in 1942, she continued to work in show business, back in New York. After a brief stint working for the producer Sam Goldwyn, she again worked with Mr. Wallis at Paramount Pictures as a story editor and was head of the talent division until 1970.         She was involved with films like ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' with Barbara Stanwyck, and ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' with Shirley Booth. She met and furthered the careers of actors like Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas and Robert Redford.         Mrs. Diamond is survived by a daughter, Jean, and two grandsons.         Speaking about ''Casablanca'' and her charitable priorities, she liked to say that ''philanthropy is a lot like Hollywood: you find a good script; you support it.''         Her own Irene Diamond Fund will continue her work, said Jane Silver, its executive director.         Correction:  February 15, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on Jan. 23 about Irene Diamond, a philanthropist who had an earlier career scouting Hollywood film scripts, including one that became the classic ''Casablanca,'' misstated the year of that film's release. It was 1942, not 1943.       
         Nell Carter, the robustly sassy singer and actress who exploded onto the New York musical stage in the Fats Waller revue ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and went on to become a popular television star in the series ''Gimme a Break!,'' died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 54.         Ms. Carter collapsed and was found by one of her sons, said her spokesman, Roger Lane. She had been in rehearsals for ''Raisin,'' a musical adaptation of the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' at a theater in Long Beach, Calif. A diabetic, Ms. Carter survived two brain aneurysms in 1992.         Although she stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall, she was a larger-than-life stage personality who never did things in half-measures. Along with Patti La Belle and Jennifer Holliday, she belonged to a select circle of theatrical pop-soul belters whose members reveled in high-powered vocal flamboyance. A typical performance by Ms. Carter reached into the fabric of a song and tore out its seams with feral flourishes.         As a singer and stage personality, Ms. Carter was also a natural comedian. Her vocal style was descended from the humorous gutbucket blues of Bessie Smith by way of Dinah Washington, whose singing also conveyed a seam of earthy amusement. The warmth and feeling for comedy that inflected her interpretations of even the saddest songs reflected Ms. Carter's desire to be what she called ''Judy Garland without the tragedy.''         For many, Ms. Carter's performances of songs like ''Honeysuckle Rose'' and ''Mean to Me'' were legendary. That show, a potpourri of mostly Fats Waller pieces, opened at the Manhattan Theater Club in February 1978, and moved to the Longacre Theater on Broadway three months later, running there for more than 1,600 performances. Ms. Carter won a Tony for best featured actress in that musical.         Three years later she won an Emmy for the NBC television production of the same show. Ms. Carter made such an indelible impression as a shimmying, bawdy old-time vaudevillian in ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' that she often found herself typecast as a rollicking good-time mama.         Her biggest success after ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the sitcom ''Gimme a Break!,'' in which she played Miss Nellie Ruth ''Nell'' Harper, the housekeeper and surrogate mother for a widowed California police chief and his three children. The show, which ran from 1981 to 1987, earned her two Emmy nominations and revived the archetype of the mammy, an African-American woman caring for a white family.         Nell Carter was born Nell Hardy in Birmingham, Ala., on Sept. 13, 1948. While growing up, she absorbed her mother's recordings of Dinah Washington and B. B. King, along with her brother's Elvis Presley records. As a child, she sang on the gospel circuit and performed on a weekly radio show, ''The Y Teens.'' Later she sang in local coffeehouses.         Moving to New York at 19, she studied acting and performed in nightclubs like Reno Sweeney, the Village Gate, Dangerfield's, the Apartment and the Rainbow Room. ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the springboard to a wide-ranging singing and acting career.         Her television credits ranged from a role on the soap opera ''Ryan's Hope'' to an appearance on the acclaimed PBS special ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' to game-show contestant on ''Match Game.'' Her theater credits include ''Hello Dolly!,'' ''Hair,'' ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         She had film roles in ''The Grass Harp'' (1995) and ''The Proprietor'' (1996).         Married and divorced twice, Ms. Carter is survived by a daughter, Tracy, and by two sons, Joshua and Daniel.       
         Doris Fisher, a songwriter whose lighthearted, sentimental tunes became hits for the Ink Spots, Ella Fitzgerald and the Mills Brothers in the 1930's and 40's, died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 87.         Among Ms. Fisher's songs, all written with a co-author, were ''Whispering Grass (Don't Tell the Trees),'' a hit for the Ink Spots in 1940; ''Angelina (the Waitress at the Pizzeria),'' sung by Louis Prima; and ''Tutti-Frutti,'' written with Slim Gaillard, a hit in 1938 that was eclipsed by Little Richard's wildly onomatopoeic song of the same title in 1956.         Born in New York City in 1915, Ms. Fisher was the daughter of the songwriter and music publisher Fred Fisher, with whom she wrote many of her first songs. Her brothers Dan and Marvin were also noted songwriters. Early in her career she sang in radio programs under the name Penny Wise, often with the Eddie Duchin Orchestra.         In 1944 she met Allan Roberts in an elevator in the Brill Building in New York, where Roberts and Ms. Fisher's father had offices. She and Roberts began a fruitful partnership. In 1944 they wrote ''You Always Hurt the One You Love,'' a million-selling hit for the Mills Brothers that was No. 1 for five weeks that year and later a hit for Spike Jones; ''Good Good Good (That's You -- That's You),'' for Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters; ''That Ole Devil Called Love,'' for Billie Holiday; and ''Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall,'' which was a No. 1 hit for Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots.         Ms. Fisher and Roberts also wrote for more than 20 films, including ''Gilda'' (the songs ''Put the Blame on Mame,'' ''Amado Mio''), ''Down to Earth'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai,'' all with Rita Hayworth; and ''Dead Reckoning,'' with Humphrey Bogart.         In 1947 she married Charles Gershenson of Detroit and retired from the music business. She became an antiques collector and, after divorcing Mr. Gershenson, moved to Los Angeles and founded a furniture store called Cookstores.         She is survived by her daughter, Frederica Fisher Thea, of Manhattan; her son, Ned Gershenson, of Henderson, Nev.; and two grandsons.       
         Rae Carlson, a psychologist who helped shape the study of personality with her 1971 paper ''Where Is the Person in Personality Research?'', died on Monday in Fairfax, Va. She was 76.         The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter Leslie Carlson-Soloway.         Dr. Carlson's paper was published at a time when personality researchers were primarily engaged in the study of mood, thinking and perception, conducting experiments that did not take the psychology of the individual test subjects into account.         Dr. Carlson called for a renewed emphasis on the study of individual lives, examined from a variety of angles.         She established the Society for Personology in 1982 to advance this research orientation. She also studied issues like altruism and political ideology, and wrote psychobiographical works on historical figures including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor.         In 1989, she received the Henry A. Murray Award, for the study of individual lives, from the American Psychological Association.         Dr. Carlson was a professor of psychology at Rutgers University, retiring in 1996. She received her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Michigan in 1958.         Rae Stahl Carlson was born in Valentine, Neb. She lived for 25 years in Princeton, N.J., and was a resident of Fairfax at the time of her death. In addition to her daughter Leslie, of Santa Fe, N.M., Dr. Carlson is survived by her daughter Tracy Carlson of Oakton, Va., and four grandchildren.       
         Sally Michel Avery, an artist, illustrator and widow of the painter Milton Avery, died on Jan. 9. She was 100 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Avery was born in Brooklyn in 1902 and studied painting at the Art Students League. She met her husband in Gloucester, Mass., in 1924 when he was 39 and living in Hartford. He moved to New York to be with her, and they married in 1926.         For the next few decades Mrs. Avery worked as a freelance illustrator, enabling her husband to paint full time, attend the Art Students League and find his mature style. During the 1940's and 50's, she worked as an illustrator for You and Your Child, which was then a column in The New York Times Magazine. The couple often worked side by side in the living room of their top-floor apartment at 294 West 11th Street and shared painting fellowships to Yaddo in 1956 and the MacDowell Colony in 1957. Mr. Avery died in 1960, at 75.         Mrs. Avery, who always exhibited as Sally Michel, had her only solo show in New York at the Waverly Gallery in 1981. Solo retrospectives of her paintings were held in 1987 at the University of Iowa Museum of Art and in 1990 at the Fresno Art Museum in California. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Fresno Art Museum and the Israel Museum.         An exhibition of her work is to open at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery on April 12; the Knoedler Gallery plans a show of the Averys' portraits of each other, also for April.         Mrs. Avery is survived by her daughter, March Avery Cavanaugh, and her grandson, Sean Avery Cavanaugh, who are artists in New York.       
         Mary Brian, a film star and memorable ingénue who bridged the silent and early sound eras, died on Monday in Del Mar, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Los Angeles.         Between ''Peter Pan'' in 1924 and ''Dragnet'' in 1947 Ms. Brian appeared in 82 films. Petite, with blue-gray eyes and dark-brown curls, she was one of Hollywood's romantic leading ladies from the mid-1920's through the late 30's.         While she did not rank with superstars like Clara Bow or Mary Pickford, she was a bankable contract player and a gratifying attraction at the box office. Her leading men were the likes of Gary Cooper, Lew Ayres, James Cagney, Cary Grant, William Haines, Warner Oland and Dick Powell.         Among her films still shown at film festivals and on television are ''Peter Pan'' and one of the earliest western talkies, ''The Virginian,'' from 1929, with Cooper as the title character and Walter Huston as the villain.         In that film Ms. Brian portrayed Molly Wood, a schoolteacher who is the Virginian's romantic interest. In his review in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote that there was good humor in Medicine Bow when ''the lass from the East clashes with the lads from the West,'' adding that Ms. Brian helped the picture along, although ''she might have been more persuasive with less rouge on her lips.''         The review also said that ''the sounds, whether footfalls, horses' hoofs, rumbling wheels or voices, are really remarkably recorded and reproduced,'' and noted that movie depictions of life in the Wild West were ''aided immeasurably by the audibility of the screen.''         Ms. Brian was born Louise Byrdie Dantzler in Corsicana, Tex. After the family's move to Long Beach, Calif., she entered a beauty contest -- and though she did not win a prize, Paramount invited her to audition for a child's part in its film version of ''Peter Pan.''         The director, Herbert Brenon, cast the young Louise as Wendy. The studio gave her a new name, Mary Brian, and pared her age to 16, deeming 18 too grown up for the part. (After that, Ms. Brian kept her real age to herself, calling it ''negotiable.'')         She remained under contract to Paramount until 1932, appearing in more than 40 of its productions. She showed her mettle as juvenile lead or co-star in ''Beau Geste'' (1926), another Brenon film, and in ''Behind the Front'' (1926), ''Harold Teen'' (1926) and ''River of Romance'' (1929).         Easily navigating the changeover to sound, she appeared in two 1931 evergreens, George Cukor's ''Royal Family of Broadway'' and Lewis Milestone's ''Front Page.''         She played W. C. Fields's daughter in several films, including ''The Man on the Flying Trapeze'' (1935). Working with him she developed a knack for playing the straight woman in comedy, which came in handy later in her career.         Among her other movies of the 1930's were ''Shadows of Sing Sing,'' ''College Rhythm,'' ''Charlie Chan in Paris'' and ''Navy Blues.'' She appeared as herself in ''Hollywood on Parade No. 9'' (1933) and ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934).         She took to the stage in vaudeville productions at the Palace Theater in New York in 1932 and toured in the 1940's with Edmund Lowe in a farce, ''Mary Had a Little . . .''         Ms. Brian said she gained a new perspective on life during World War II when she entertained troops, venturing closer to the front lines in Europe than most headliners. She spent Christmas 1944 with the soldiers fighting the Battle of the Bulge.         She ended her movie career after the war with ''Dragnet,'' but continued to make occasional television appearances.         In 1947 Ms. Brian married George Tomasini, a Hollywood film editor; he died in 1964.         She is survived by her godson, Stuart Erwin Jr., of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.       
         Dr. Eleanor J. Gibson, a psychology professor at Cornell who made advances in the study of perception and learning processes in children, died on Dec. 30 in Columbia, S.C. She was 92.         Photographs of the ''visual cliff,'' a device she developed to study depth perception in infants and toddlers, are still included in some psychology textbooks.         Dr. Gibson, then working as a research associate at Cornell, and Dr. Richard Walk used the simulated cliff in tests to show that babies could visually distinguish depth.         The cliff was ''a wooden table from the edge of which strong plate glass extended,'' Life magazine reported in 1959.         ''Children were put on the table top and coaxed to crawl out over the glass,'' the magazine said. ''But when they got to the edge of the cliff and looked down almost all of them quickly withdrew. Even their mothers' most persuasive urgings could not get them out.''         Similar studies were done with animals, including rats and kittens.         The findings indicated that perception is an essentially adaptive process, or as Dr. Gibson put it, ''We perceive to learn, as well as learn to perceive.''         Dr. Gibson also did pioneering work in the relationship of perception and reading.         Eleanor Jack was born in Peoria, Ill. She received her bachelor's degree from Smith in 1931 and her master's degree in 1933. She earned her doctorate in psychology at Yale in 1938.         Her marriage in 1932 to Dr. James J. Gibson, a psychology professor who also conducted research on perception, was both a help and a hindrance to her career.         They collaborated occasionally, but when he joined the faculty of Cornell in 1949, she was unable to secure a teaching post there because of anti-nepotism rules, which were common in universities. So she worked as a research associate at Cornell.         In 1965, after the rules changed, she was appointed to an endowed chair as a professor of psychology, and the Gibsons became one of the first married couples in a single department at the university.         She also held academic appointments at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, Calif.; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the Universities of Minnesota, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Connecticut; Emory and the Salk Institute.         In 1982, she was invited to Beijing to teach Chinese psychologists about recent theories and techniques of research.         Dr. Gibson was the author of five books, including the memoir ''Perceiving the Affordances: A Portrait of Two Psychologists,'' published in 2001.         Recently, Dr. Gibson lived in Columbia.         Her husband died in 1979. She is survived by a son, James J., also of Columbia; a daughter, Jean Rosenberg of Middlebury, Vt.; a sister, Emily Jack of Washington; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  January 8, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Dr. Eleanor J. Gibson, a psychology professor at Cornell who was a pioneer in perception studies, misstated the number of her grandchildren and referred incompletely to her residence. She had four grandchildren, not three. In recent years, she spent time in Middlebury, Vt., in addition to Columbia, S.C.       
         Jean Kerr, whose wry wit and unerring eye for life's everyday absurdities kept legions of readers and theatergoers laughing with books like ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies'' and plays like ''Mary, Mary,'' died on Sunday in White Plains. She was 80.         The apparent cause was pneumonia, her son Christopher said. She was in White Plains Hospital and lived nearby in Larchmont, N.Y., also in Westchester County.         Mrs. Kerr, who was the widow of the drama critic Walter Kerr, was well acquainted with the glamour, grit and egocentric follies of life in the theater and capitalized on that experience. She wrote entertainingly and often about show business, musing about what to say when lunching with a prospective producer (order a drink, so you look relaxed, but don't touch it lest he think you're an alcoholic), or gloomily anticipating negative reviews of her latest work (''If I have to commit suicide, I have nothing but Gelusil'').         But she also had an unquestioned gift for finding the comic in the commonplace anxieties of suburbia and married life. She cheerfully acknowledged doing most of her writing in the family car, parked several blocks away from the scrambling chaos of several children and pets (''There is nothing to do but write, after I get the glove compartment tidied up'').         The Kerrs made their debut as a team on Broadway in 1946 with ''Song of Bernadette,'' a dramatization of Franz Werfel's novel about a young Frenchwoman who was canonized after saying she had seen visions of the Virgin Mary in a grotto near Lourdes. It was not a success, nor was her solo writing effort two years later, a comedy called ''Jenny Kissed Me,'' about a priest who finds his household disrupted by the arrival of his housekeeper's niece.         Jean and Walter Kerr teamed up again in 1949 with ''Touch and Go,'' a revue for which they wrote the sketches and lyrics and which Mr. Kerr directed. The show was a hit, with sketches ranging from ''Hamlet'' performed as a musical comedy to a location rehearsal for a film sequence in which one of the characters, a trained ape, turns out to be smarter than the glamorous actress who is the star of the film. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times,praised the Kerrs' ''breezy and informed wit'' and hailed the show as the best of the season.         After contributing some sketches to another revue, ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac,'' in 1953, Mrs. Kerr joined forces to write ''King of Hearts'' with Eleanor Brooke. Starring Donald Cooke, Jackie Cooper and Cloris Leachman, and staged by Mr. Kerr, the 1954 comedy about a comic-strip artist and his love-struck secretary was well received.         Mrs. Kerr scored her first big success outside the theater with the publication in 1957 of ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies,'' a witty and wide-ranging collection of pieces about everything from the pet dogs in her life to the oddities of the Kerrs' house in Larchmont, which boasted a two-story fireplace and a carillon that played the duet from ''Carmen.'' The book became a best seller and then a movie in 1960, with David Niven and Doris Day. It became a television situation comedy as well, and ran on NBC from 1965 to 1967.         The Kerrs returned to Broadway in 1958 with their musical comedy ''Goldilocks,'' staged by Mr. Kerr, with music by Leroy Anderson, lyrics by the Kerrs and Joan Ford, and choreography by Agnes de Mille. The show closed after a mercifully brief run, and the Kerrs made a mutual vow never to mention its name again.         Mrs. Kerr went on to take Broadway by storm in 1961 with ''Mary, Mary,'' a comedy about a divorced couple who seem headed for new and misguided relationships until they discover that they still love each other. Barbara Bel Geddes played the title character, Barry Nelson her stubbornly obtuse former spouse, with Betsy von Furstenberg and Michael Rennie as the handsome troublemakers. The Times's critic, Howard Taubman, gave the show a mixed review.         Nevertheless, audiences packed the theater nightly and ''Mary, Mary'' became one of the longest-running productions of the decade. Its 1963 screen adaptation, was directed by Mervyn LeRoy with Debbie Reynolds and Barry Nelson. Meanwhile, the original show was still on Broadway, with more than 1,500 performances in all.         Jean Collins Kerr was born in Scranton, Pa., on July 10, 1922. She attended Marywood Seminary and Marywood College in Scranton and acquired a taste for theater while still a student. She was serving as stage manager of a college production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' when she met Mr. Kerr, then a professor of drama at Catholic University in Washington. Shortly after earning her bachelor's degree at Marywood, she married and received a master's degree from Catholic University in 1945.         Her self-deprecating humor was amply evident in her other published work. She also wrote ''The Snake Has All the Lines'' (1960), ''Penny Candy'' (1970) and ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' (1978), collections of humorous essays.         Her family was a rich source of comic inspiration, a minefield of the unexpected that demanded resilience and a gift for improvisation. In addition to Christopher, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Kerr is survived by her sons Colin of Port Jefferson, N.Y., John of Portland, Me., Gregory of Coopersburg, Pa., and Gilbert of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.; her daughter, Kitty of Arlington, Mass.; her brothers Hugh Collins of Meriden, Conn., and Frank Collins of Ardmore, Pa., and 11 granchildren.         Mr. Kerr, whose long career embraced teaching, playwriting, directing and theater criticism -- first for The New York Herald Tribune and then for The Times -- died in 1996 at 83.         A tall, handsome woman with a ready smile, Mrs. Kerr never took herself too seriously. ''I'm not a natural playwright at all,'' she told an interviewer. ''I write what I know.'' There were those who felt she drew water from the same well too often. Phyllis Theroux, writing about ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' in The New York Times Sunday Book Review, noted that ''beneath her cleverness lies a sizable literary talent'' waiting to be aired.         Mrs. Kerr returned to the theater in 1964 with ''Poor Richard,'' a coolly reviewed romantic comedy.         Nearly 10 years passed before her next appearance on Broadway, with another romantic comedy, ''Finishing Touches'' (1973).         The 1980 comedy ''Lunch Hour'' turned out to be Mrs. Kerr's farewell to the theater. Set in the Hamptons and directed by Mike Nichols, the play starred Sam Waterston and Gilda Radner.         For all her experience and success in the theater, Mrs. Kerr never stopped worrying about how her work would be received.         She regarded opening night as ''a public hanging, and you're the hanged.'' She once said, ''I think if you can write a play or produce a play,'' the first step toward success has been made, if ''people don't want to kill themselves in the lobby.'' Then came the inimitable extra twist of Kerr: ''Now there must be four or five other steps, but that's the first.''       
         Sarah McClendon, the tiny, klaxon-voiced White House reporter who covered, pestered, lectured and often infuriated presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt, chiefly as the leader of her one-woman McClendon News Service, died today at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center here. She was 92.         First mocked in an almost all-male press corps, then scorned as a vocal crank and finally honored as a pioneer, Ms. McClendon was the nation's longest-serving White House reporter, from 1944 to the early days of the current Bush administration. She became celebrated for questions at presidential news conferences that included local concerns in Texas, her home state, and government lapses overlooked by others.         In the 1950's, she identified herself successively as the representative of so many of her small-town newspaper clients that Dwight D. Eisenhower once demanded to know, ''Do you get fired every week?''         Helen Thomas, the veteran White House correspondent recalled: ''She made the veins stand out in Eisenhower's head, because he would get so mad. Sometimes people thought her questions were off the wall, but other times, she hit them right in the eye.''         Indeed, Ms. McClendon once advised Eisenhower to ''leave off some of your golf and go out and visit some of the small cities.'' She later apologized.         ''Citizen journalist is a mission I took for myself,'' Ms. McClendon wrote in her 1996 memoir, ''Mr. President, Mr. President! My 50 Years of Covering the White House.'' ''It offers the best opportunity to serve one's country, the people and the public interest.''         In her later years, with just a handful of clients left, she sometimes embraced conspiracy theories without proof. But through the 1990's, she checked the White House's recorded announcement of the president's schedule before dawn. Her hair rinsed a reddish shade called Frisky Fawn, she used a wheelchair but still shouted questions in a style that Eric Sevareid once said could ''give rudeness a bad name.''         In 1962, she drew a withering rebuke from John F. Kennedy for publicly calling two State Department employees ''security risks.'' Early in his tenure, the first President Bush publicly warned her that ''the loudest voice won't always get recognized because it isn't fair to the others.'' But he took her questions just the same.         ''Many a president thought he could change the subject by calling on Sarah and lived to regret it,'' said Michael D. McCurry, press secretary for President Bill Clinton.         Mr. Clinton issued a statement today saying, ''I hope St. Peter is prepared for the kinds of questions that nearly a dozen presidents had to face.''         Ms. McClendon served as a public relations lieutenant in the Women's Army Corps in World War II, and she diligently covered the Veterans Administration, later the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 1974, she drew criticism for asking President Richard M. Nixon about delays in processing G.I. Bill tuition checks for Vietnam veterans. It turned out to be a real problem, and Nixon later acknowledged her in a radio address. Ms. McClendon disclosed that the Secret Service had warned her never again to aim a ballpoint pen at President Nixon when questioning him.         Ms. McClendon was born in Tyler, Tex., and began her career on small Texas newspapers before moving to the Washington bureau of The Philadelphia Daily News in 1944. Two years later she started her news service.         A brief marriage to John Thomas O'Brien produced her only child, Sally Newcomb MacDonald. Mr. O'Brien abandoned his wife while she was pregnant and later died. Besides her daughter, who lives in Washington, Ms. McClendon is survived by a granddaughter and great-granddaughter.         She was a single, working mother when that was rare, and on the day of her first Washington assignment she had to plead with a baby sitter to stay overtime. The sitter agreed, and Ms. McClendon made her deadline.       
         Amy Bess Williams Miller, who helped found Hancock Shaker Village, a restoration of a former Shaker community and a museum, died on Sunday at her home in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 90.         Mrs. Miller, an expert on the Shaker religious movement, was president of Hancock Shaker Village Inc. from 1959 to 1990. The museum and historic site on the border between Pittsfield and Hancock contains many pieces of Shaker handiwork, including Shaker furniture that Mrs. Miller donated.         She also raised funds and directed the restoration of the site, which had been a Shaker community for a century. The Shaker movement, named for the pious trembling of its members, began in 1747 in Britain as a celibate offshoot of the Quakers.         She began her work shortly before the Shakers ended the settlement in 1960, a century after Shakerism had begun to decline, leaving behind more than 12 buildings. At one time, it appeared that a nearby racetrack would acquire the buildings. But a group of Pittsfielders bought them from the remaining Shakers.         Mrs. Miller's writings include ''Shaker Medicinal Herbs: A Compendium of History, Lore, and Uses'' (1998, Storey in association with Hancock Shaker Village).         A doctor's daughter, Amy Bess Williams was born in El Paso and grew up in Worcester, Mass. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield and studied at the Sorbonne.         Her husband, Lawrence K. Miller, who was editor and publisher of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, died in 1991, after 58 years of marriage,         Her survivors include a daughter, Margo Miller of Boston; three sons, Kelton II, of Shaftsbury, Vt., and Michael and Mark, both of Pittsfield; a sister, Margery Adams of Charlotte, N.C.; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Eve Stillman, a retired lingerie designer who also owned and led the lingerie company that bore her name, died on Friday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 97.         In the 1940's when Gracette Lingerie, a company founded by her husband, Harry Stillman, encountered financial problems, she intervened and helped shift the company to higher-priced products.         In 1956 she changed the company's name to Eve Stillman, and later it became Eve Stillman Inc.         Its products included hand-embroidered nightgowns, and it had particular success with horsehair petticoats for the full-skirted fashions of the 1950's.         In 1981, she received a Femmy award from Intimate Apparel Industry, a trade group for lingerie makers.         When she retired in 1989 most of the assets of her company were sold and became a division of Kefco Industries.         Eve Feinberg was born in Upper Manhattan and attended Hunter College.         Her husband died in 1979 after 44 years of marriage.         She is survived by her twin sister, Bertha Freeman of Miami; a brother, David Feinberg of West Palm Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Frances Linderman of Trinidad, Calif.; and two grandchildren.       
         Lillian Nadel Gerard, who was active in exhibiting and marketing foreign films in the United States for three decades, died last Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The cause was complications of cancer, her husband, Philip R. Gerard, said.         After she was hired in 1936 by an American importer of foreign films, she did publicity and advertising for ''The Eternal Mask,'' a film produced in Switzerland.         As she recalled in 1985, ''That picture launched my debut in foreign films, and through my hands passed films of every origin in every genre, films that are now classics: 'Grand Illusion,' 'Pépé le Moko,' 'Children of Paradise,' 'The Seventh Seal' and many others, including a revival of Chaplin's 'City Lights.' ''         Over the years, she was an executive of the Paris Theater in Manhattan and a consultant to the Rugoff Theaters, the Little Carnegie and the Fifth Avenue Cinema. She also worked with independent film importers.         In 1950, as the Paris Theater's managing director, she protested the banning by New York City's Department of Licenses of the film ''The Miracle'' as ''blasphemous'' while it was being shown at the Paris.         She also worked on special projects at the Museum of Modern Art.         A Bronx native, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Bernard Baruch College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard; a daughter, Jennifer Gerard Maric; three grandchildren; and a brother, Irwin.       
         Cora Ginsburg, a prominent dealer in antique fabrics and clothing, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 92.         After World War II she worked with her husband, Benjamin Ginsburg, at Ginsburg & Levy, his family's antiques firm, at 815 Madison Ave., in Manhattan.         Its customers included the Metropolitan Museum of Art and notable collectors like Henry du Pont, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Electra Havemeyer Webb and Ima Hogg, who made purchases for themselves and for museums.         Mrs. Ginsburg was also a consultant and seller to Colonial Williamsburg, the Fashion Institute of Technology and other major institutions.         From about 1950 on, she was the buyer of textiles, needlework, ceramics, silver and brass for Ginsburg & Levy, which was dissolved in 1976. She did the same for her husband's successor firm, Benjamin Ginsburg Antiquary, until he retired in 1982.         She helped develop the field of costume in the worlds of antiques and museums, sharing her knowledge with a number of museums in the United States and elsewhere.         She opened a gallery, Cora Ginsburg, Inc., at 819 Madison Ave in 1982 and later moved it to 19 East 74th St. In 1997 Titi Halle became the owner of the gallery, which is now named Cora Ginsburg LLC. It sells antique costume, textiles and needlework from the 16 century through the 20th.         Cora Kling was born and grew up in the Bronx and attended Hunter College. She contributed valuable costumes and textiles to museums.         Her husband, whom she married in 1929, died in 1994.         She is survived by two sons, Henry, of London and Carl, of Frankfurt; a daughter, Deborah Ramsden of Woodstock, N.Y.; two grandchildren; and a sister, Elizabeth Trace of Peekskill, N.Y.       
         Noriko Sawada Bridges Flynn, a writer and civil rights worker who managed to transcend the struggle between management and labor in her personal and professional life, died on Feb. 7 at her home in Pescadero, Calif. She was 79.         Her first marriage, to Harry Bridges, the fiery Marxist leader of the West Coast longshoremen's union, required a change in legislation. After his death more than three decades later, she married Ed Flynn, president of a Pacific shippers association, who had long skirmished with Mr. Bridges across bargaining tables and picket lines.         For half a century, Ms. Flynn worked for union rights, fair treatment of immigrants and racial and sexual equality but was best known for her contrasting marriages.         Her first wedding, planned as an elopement, was initially thwarted by a Nevada law forbidding marriage between whites and Asians. She was the American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, and Mr. Bridges was an immigrant from Australia. Friends said Ms. Flynn had a wicked sense of humor. She married Mr. Flynn, the shipping boss, on May Day, the international socialist holiday.         Ms. Flynn grew up on rented land near Los Angeles, where her parents grew fruit and vegetables. Beginning in 1942, when the government ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast, the family spent three years in a desert camp in Arizona. After the war, she moved to the San Francisco area, where for 12 years she was a secretary for Charles Garry, a lawyer whose clients included leading political dissidents and radicals. Mr. Garry introduced her to Mr. Bridges.         As Ms. Flynn described that first meeting to Robert Cherny, a history professor at San Francisco State University who is working on a biography of Mr. Bridges, her future husband was quite drunk. ''Where have you been?'' he mumbled. She replied, ''You mean, as in all your life?''         A relationship ensued and in December 1958, the couple drove to Reno for what they hoped would be a quiet and private wedding.         However, when Mr. Bridges, 58, and Ms. Sawada, 35, asked for a marriage license, the clerk explained that an 1846 law prohibited marriages between whites and Asians. Mr. Bridges protested, saying that his bride was an American, born in the United States, while he was the foreigner.         News accounts quoted the clerk as saying, ''It's not a matter of where you were born. It's the blood. It's against the law here.''         Mr. Bridges quickly took his case to the national press. Within four days lawyers for the couple succeeded in having the law struck down. The two obtained their license and were married in Reno.         For the next 32 years, until Mr. Bridges died in 1990, they were one of San Francisco's most prominent couples. She resumed the studies interrupted by her internment and wrote articles about her childhood for several national magazines. She was also at her husband's side in the 1970's when he stepped up his union's battle with the shippers for guarantees of job security.         In that bitter struggle, Mr. Bridges's major adversary was Ed Flynn, president of the Pacific Maritime Association. In 1971 a strike by Mr. Bridges's union shut down all 56 Pacific ports. But the two men liked and respected each other and understood each other's positions, Mr. Cherny said. He said they would battle in negotiations and then go out for dinner with their wives.         After they both retired, they continued to see each other. And after Harry Bridges's death, his widow kept in touch with his old opponent, who had become a widower. They married in 1994.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Flynn is survived by a daughter, Katherine Bridges Wiggins of Bandon, Ore., and two stepchildren, Robert Bridges of Fremont, Calif., and Marie Shell of San Francisco.       
         Baroness Liliane de Rothschild, the wife of Baron Elie de Rothschild, an art collector, philanthropist and meticulous caretaker of the history of the family she married into, died on Feb. 17 in her home in Royaumont, outside Paris. She was 86.         Her husband, a member of the French branch of the Rothschilds, was a skilled polo player and is reputedly the family's foremost wine connoisseur and a widely knowledgeable collector of art. But as much as the baron exemplifies the family's grand style, he once said his wife was the family member most steeped in family history, tradition and élan.         In Derek Wilson's book ''Rothschild: the Wealth and Power of a Dynasty,'' the baron said his wife was more Rothschild than the Rothschilds.         Liliane Fould-Springer was born on May 11, 1916. She was part of a rival French financial family, a great-niece of Achille Fould, the rival of James Rothschild in the mid-19th century. Mr. Fould's financial house, Crédit Mobilier, had threatened to smash the Rothschild supremacy, but in the end lost out to the family.         The Rothschilds were childhood sweethearts and became engaged before World War II. Baron Elie and his brother, Alain, were serving at the front when Germany overran France in 1940. Both were captured and ended up in Colditz Castle, the Germans' most secure prison, after separate escape attempts.         Baron Elie wrote to Miss Fould-Springer and proposed that they marry by proxy. Her parents were opposed to the idea, pointing out that it was not helpful to bear the name Rothschild with the Gestapo swarming over France.         But Liliane agreed. Wedding ceremonies took place many months apart, with Baron Elie giving his pledge at Colditz on Oct. 7, 1941, and Miss Fould-Springer giving hers at Cannes on April 7, 1942.         After the war, her husband ran Chateau Lafite, one of the family vineyards. Chateau Mouton, long owned by Philippe de Rothschild, is equally famous. The vineyards have been rivals since 1855, ever since Lafite was classified as premier cru, or first category, and Mouton as only second. Mouton achieved the long-sought first category in 1973.         The vineyard rivalry sometimes approached bitterness. But when Philippe's daughter, Philippine, was to be married in 1961, Liliane de Rothschild fulfilled her frequent role of unifying the family. In the face of Philippe's heated campaign to burnish Mouton's allure, Baroness de Rothschild staged the wedding in the vaulted cellars of Lafite.         ''Here all lifted glasses to the bride, to groom, to both Rothschild vineyards, and to Liliane, the hostess,'' Frederic Morton wrote in ''The Rothschilds: A Family Portrait.''         Baroness de Rothschild was a frequent presence in the world of haute couture. The designer Balenciaga made a doll for her, depicting one of her daughters at the age of 9.         She was also important in the art world, particularly as a recognized expert on 18th-century art. Part of her role, according to the Morton book, was organizing the vast art purchases her husband made.         But sometimes she made her own purchases. The New York Times in 1999 reported her vigorous bidding on several items, including a German clock case from around 1550, that another branch of the Rothschilds was auctioning off. She paid $148,105 for items expected to sell for $16,000 at most.         Her social circle included the expected royalty and celebrities, like her friend Greta Garbo, whom she called ''the loveliest woman you or I ever saw or will see,'' but she preferred that they be interesting people.         The baroness is survived by her husband; two daughters, Nellie Munthe of London and Elisabeth of Paris; a son, Nathaniel of New York City; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         She was famed for both her worldly wit and her great composure. Christopher Ogden, in his book ''Life of the Party: The Biography of Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman,'' told of the evening in 1954, when the baroness was seated at a dinner next to the Duke of Windsor.         He turned to her and asked, ''Which Rothschild is the lover of Pamela Churchill?''         ''My husband, sir,'' the baroness replied.       
         Anne Burr McDermott, who as Anne Burr was a leading lady on Broadway and radio and in early television in the 1940's and 50's, died on Feb. 1 not far from her home in Old Lyme, Conn. She was 84.         After acting in stock and radio roles, she made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the drama ''Native Son,'' staged by Orson Welles.         Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times praised what he called her ''grim acting of the rich man's daughter'' as ''an accurate and fearless sketch of character without loss of time or motion.''         Other plays she acted in included ''Plan M'' (1942) and ''The Hasty Heart'' (1945). She signed a long-term contract at R.K.O. Radio Pictures and performed in radio dramas. In the early 1950's she was the leading lady, playing a doctor, in the CBS television series ''City Hospital.''         She was also one of the original stars of ''As the World Turns.''         After being blacklisted during the McCarthy era, she returned to an active television career.         In 1959 she ended her professional career and moved to Los Angeles with her husband, Tom McDermott, whom she had married in 1953.         Her husband died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Maggie McDermott-Walsh of Bernardsville, N.J.; two sons, Burr, of Boston, and Michael, of Beijing; and five grandchildren.       
         Peggy Conklin, a stage actress who found early success in ''The Petrified Forest'' in 1936 and followed it with a wide variety of dramatic and comic roles on Broadway, died last Tuesday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 96.         Ms. Conklin had leading or featured roles from the 1930's through the 1950's. She made a brief detour to Hollywood in 1934, making five films in a few years, then returning to New York.         She was Gabby Maple, the filling-station waitress, in Robert Sherwood's ''Petrified Forest.'' The drama featured Humphrey Bogart as the desperate killer Duke Mantee, a role that would help make him a star. Ms. Conklin also appeared with Helen Hayes in ''The Wisteria Tree,'' Joshua Logan's 1950 adaptation of Chekhov's ''Cherry Orchard.'' She was Janice Rule's anxious mother in William Inge's ''Picnic'' (1953), which also starred Ralph Meeker, Eileen Heckart, Kim Stanley and Paul Newman.         In 1941 she originated a role on Broadway that was to remain popular for decades on radio and television: Pam North, the amiably ditzy wife of Jerry North in Owen Davis's 1941 adaptation of Richard Lockridge's detective story ''Mr. and Mrs. North.'' Playing opposite Albert Hackett, the urbane New York couple stumble into a murder mystery: a corpse in their closet.         ''Peggy Conklin's charm keeps Mrs. North's informality from being the annoyance it probably is,'' the theater critic Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times.         Peggy Conklin was born on Nov. 2, 1902, in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. She spoke little of her childhood, her son, Michael Thompson, said yesterday, except to say that it had been marked by poverty and her father's absence. Her mother died when Miss Conklin was 12, he said, and she was left in the care of two aunts. After graduating from high school, she left for New York to pursue an acting career.         Ms. Conklin married James D. Thompson, an advertising executive, in 1935. He died in 1998. Besides her son, of Redwood City, Calif., she is survived by a daughter, Antonia West, of Stroud, Gloucestershire, England, and three grandchildren.         Although she continued to act after her marriage, the demands of family life proved distracting. ''In later years,'' her son said, ''she would look back and say, 'Gosh, I wonder if I could have had a career like Helen Hayes or Mary Martin.' ''         Correction:  March 27, 2003, Thursday  An obituary of the actress Peggy Conklin on Tuesday misstated her birth year. It was 1906, not 1902.       
         Anne Logan Davis Wichern, a lung specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and professor emeritus at New York University who established one of the country's first emphysema clinics, died March 9. She was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said, and she died at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital.         Dr. Davis, as she was known professionally, was a pioneer in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. She founded the emphysema unit at Bellevue in 1956 and remained its director until two years ago, when it was merged into the hospital's chest and asthma units.         She was associated with Bellevue since she started her internship there in 1949. An authority in pulmonary critical care, she formally retired in December as an attending physician at the hospital.         She directed the Bellevue chest clinic from 1987 to 1992, overseeing some 6,000 patient visits every year. Through the 1970's and 1980's, she also was a physician and consultant at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan.         She started her academic career as an instructor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1957, rising to assistant professor of medicine in 1968. That year, she accepted an associate professorship with permanent tenure at the New York University School of Medicine, from which she retired in December.         Anne Logan Davis was born in Rahway, N.J., and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945 and received her medical degree at Columbia in 1949. She decided to specialize in chest and pediatric pulmonary medicine while a resident at Bellevue in the 1950's, after recovering from tuberculosis contracted during her internship.         From experience, she found that in a busy municipal hospital the special needs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary illnesses tended to receive short shrift. She was given the opportunity to organize the emphysema clinic to deal comprehensively with the patients' medical, social and economic conditions, and to undertake a systematic study and record of their progress.         Dr. Davis is survived by her husband of 47 years, Dr. Walter Adam Wichern Jr., chairman emeritus of surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center; a son, Walter A. III, and a daughter, A. Logan Wichern, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Carol Goodman of Morristown, N.J.       
         Elaine Barrie, the fourth wife of the Shakespearean actor John Barrymore, with whom she shared a tumultuous on-again, off-again engagement and marriage that enthralled the nation in the darkest days of the Depression, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her story unwinds like an old-fashioned movie. As a Hunter College student of 19, she wrote an adoring letter to Barrymore, then 53 and hospitalized in Manhattan. He phoned her, they had a pleasant talk and he invited her to visit him. There was a most meaningful kiss in his hospital room.         They almost immediately became known to the public by the Shakespearean names they had bestowed on each other, Ariel and Caliban, from ''The Tempest.'' There was a mysterious voyage on Barrymore's yacht, a cross-country chase (with her pursuing him), an elopement and tender reconciliations after spectacular quarrels.         But there were darker elements to the tale. Barrymore, one of the leading interpreters of Shakespeare in the 20th century, was in decline because of the ravages of alcoholism, reduced to reading his lines. Many speculated that the young woman was using him to help her own nascent acting career.         The saga at times seemed to sink to slapstick. When Barrymore got his bride a role in a 1940 play, ''My Dear Children,'' the most photographed, talked-about scene occurred when he held her in his lap and spanked her. And the best-remembered of her few films was undoubtedly the saucy short ''How to Undress in Front of Your Husband,'' released in 1937 and still available for sale.         Elaine Jacobs, the daughter of a traveling salesman, was born on July 16, 1915. She first saw Barrymore in the 1931 film ''Svengali'' and vowed to marry him, a friend, Linda Herman, recounted. At 16 she won a walk-on part with a stock company that turned into a talking role. She wrote and directed plays at Hunter College.         Even before she married, Miss Jacobs changed her name to Barrie because it sounded like Barrymore. She used Barrymore during her marriage.         She wrote a series of articles about her romance for The New York Mirror in 1935. In the first installment she told of reading that Barrymore's marriage to the actress Dolores Costello was on the rocks and of ''turning faint with exultation.''         In her fateful letter, dated March 3, 1935, she told Barrymore he could ''make a dream of mine come true!'' She followed up with a phone call.         Sandford Dody, who helped Miss Barrie write her autobiography, ''All My Sins Remembered'' (Appleton-Century, 1964), suggested that Barrymore had found her a breezy change of pace.         ''It was easy to see why the aging actor, sick in a hospital and sated with strawberry blondes of Hollywood who were as bland as Wonder Bread, found this bright and wry little New York girl, with all her crust, a tasty morsel,'' he wrote in his own autobiography, ''Giving Up the Ghost: A Writer's Life Among the Stars'' (M. Evans, 1980).         It was an uneasy courtship, with one argument leading to Barrymore's seizing the diamond ring he had given her and saying that he would return it only if she did not call it an engagement ring.         The marriage, celebrated a few minutes after midnight on Nov. 9, 1936, in Yuma, Ariz., was hardly smooth sailing, either. There were at least four public separations, including one legal divorce that they agreed to reverse. The first tiff, in which Mrs. Barrymore said her husband ''roughed me up a bit,'' came 57 days after their wedding, on New Year's Eve. The final divorce was on Nov. 27, 1940.         The Barrymore family -- which traces its acting tradition to 1752 and is today most famously represented by Drew, the granddaughter of John Barrymore and Miss Costello -- treated Miss Barrie as a pariah. She was the first of John's four wives to use the Barrymore name professionally, and the first Barrymore to undress onstage.         Miss Barrie appeared in radio, plays and movies at the behest of her husband, but she is credited with only one full-length film, ''Midnight,'' a 1939 movie starring Claudette Colbert. After the divorce she remained part of the Hollywood scene and dated Errol Flynn and Ray Milland, among others.         She later ran a business importing straw baskets and handbags from Haiti. Last year she sold at auction a silver pillbox once owned by her friend Marilyn Monroe. To help Christopher Plummer prepare for a one-man show on John Barrymore on Broadway in 1997 she showed him Barrymore's love letters.         Miss Barrie was the only former wife to attend Barrymore's funeral in 1942. She never remarried and has no immediate survivors. In 1957 she told The New York Herald Tribune that marrying anybody else would have been ''anticlimactic.''       
         Nadine Conner, who sang on the radio with Bing Crosby and Gordon MacRae before a lengthy career as a lyric soprano at the Metropolitan Opera, died March 1 in Los Alamitos, Calif. She was 96.         She made her New York debut on Dec. 22, 1941, as Pamina in an English version of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' conducted by Bruno Walter. She was hailed for both her vocal promise and her youthful beauty. It was not generally known that she was then about 35.         After singing the role of the Forest Bird in ''Siegfried,'' she went on to demanding roles in 1943, singing the first of 25 Sophies in ''Der Rosenkavalier.''         She also sang with the New York Philharmonic beginning in 1942, when she took a solo part in Mahler's Second Symphony, under Walter, who then chose her for annual performances of the Bach ''St. Matthew Passion.''         Among her outstanding recordings was one of ''Hansel and Gretel'' in 1947, in which she and Risë Stevens sang the title roles. It was the first complete opera recording made in this country, according to the Met archivists.         In 1951, also under Walter, she sang Marzelline in ''Fidelio,'' in which her voice had to stand up to the heroic sounds of Kirsten Flagstad.         She progressed to a memorable Tyrone Guthrie production of ''Carmen'' in 1951 and 1952, and sang Mimi in a new production of ''La Bohème'' as well.         Altogether she gave 249 performances of 15 roles before her last Met performance, in ''Faust,'' on March 12, 1960.         The New York Times said her final performance made ''an appealing Marguerite'' that showed her vocally in admirable form. ''Her farewell performance,'' wrote John Briggs, ''was one of the best of her Metropolitan career.''         She was born Evelyn Nadine Henderson into a large, artistic family in Compton, Calif., and studied piano and drama as a child. In high school she studied voice on the side, and she soon decided that her voice belonged in the lighter lyric repertory rather than in roles like Puccini's ''Tosca'' or ''Madame Butterfly.''         She found a niche in radio, singing with orchestras in national broadcasts. She got the attention of talent scouts and, finally, the invitation to audition at the Metropolitan.         While studying music at the University of California in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to a classmate, whose name she kept for the stage.         She was married again, in 1939, to Laurance Heacock, a surgeon, with whom she returned to Southern California in 1970.         They settled in Cypress, where she taught singing.         Dr. Heacock died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Sue Lynn Hawkins of Irvine, Calif.; a son, Loren Heacock of Fountain Valley, Calif.; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Johnson, who sang in musical theater on and off Broadway in the 1950's, died on Feb. 24 at her daughter's home in Sacramento. She was 75.         She had emphysema, said Greg MacKellan, who produced some CD's she sang on.         Her biggest moment came when she was a featured performer in the role of Cleo, the heroine's waitress friend, in the musical ''The Most Happy Fella.'' It opened on Broadway in 1956.         She won a Theater World Award for her performance.         She was born in Columbus, Ohio, and arrived in New York City in 1947. She was in the chorus of Radio City Music Hall. By 1950 she had the comic role of Meg Brockie in the musical ''Brigadoon'' at the New York City Center near Broadway.         Her marriage to Robert Pastene, an actor, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Chet Kehn, died in 1984.         Her survivors include a daughter, Corianne, from her second marriage.       
         Judy V. Wilson, long a successful publisher of children's books, most recently at Orchard Books, an imprint of Scholastic Inc., died in Manhattan on Friday. She was 63 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, said Deborah Hochman Turvey, a family friend.         Mrs. Wilson was the president and general manager of the Macmillan Publishing Co. Children's Book Group from 1988 to 1994. Under her leadership, the book group's distinguished children's hardcover imprints -- Macmillan, the Bradbury Press, Margaret K. McElderry Books, Atheneum, Four Winds Press and Scribner's and two paperback lines, Aladdin and Collier -- were integrated into one profitable organization with shared service departments, an innovation for the time. Revenues tripled, and the group was cited by The Wall Street Journal as ''the jewel of Macmillan's assets.'' It was sold in 1993 as a unit to Paramount Inc., then the parent of Simon & Schuster, and most of the imprints were eliminated.         In 1996 after Orchard's editorial and marketing staff left to start another company, Mrs. Wilson re-established the Orchard Books imprint, diversified it and led it through its acquisition by Scholastic Inc. She retired in 2001.         Mrs. Wilson was born in Old Hickory, Tenn., raised in Iowa and Virginia and graduated from Smith College in 1961 with a degree in philosophy and English. She began her career as a project manager for the Encyclopedia Britannica. From 1965 to 1985 she was a publisher within the professional group of John Wiley & Sons Inc. first developing the Self-Teaching Guide series, then computer books for Atari and Radio Shack, selling books to computer manufacturers for packing with personal computers. She established the Wiley Press, a trade paperback line, and Wiley Professional Software.         She is survived by her husband, Robert Wilson; her son, Rob; and her daughter, Hilary.       
         Margaret Formby, a rancher's daughter whose collection of cowgirl costumes, stored in the basement of a local library, evolved into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, died on April 10 at her home in Hereford, Tex. She was 73.         She apparently hit her head in a fall in her bathroom, where her housekeeper found her, The Associated Press reported.         The hall of fame opened in a $21 million building in Fort Worth last year. But it began in 1975 with an even longer name, the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center, and not much else.         The Chamber of Commerce of Hereford had begun a rodeo for women. The festivities included honoring famous cowgirls, and Mrs. Formby had a luncheon for them.         The first woman inducted was Alice Greenough Orr, billed as Queen of the Rodeo. A Montana cowgirl, Ms. Orr won three national rodeo championships in the 1930's and 40's. She rode fighting bulls in Spain, taught Dale Evans how to ride and performed movie stunts into her 80's.         Stories like Ms. Orr's prompted Mrs. Formby to begin collecting cowgirl artifacts. Deeply interested in rodeo, Mrs. Formby was the first woman elected to the Texas Tech Rodeo Hall of Fame. She was also an English and speech teacher.         ''I was finding out how much of the old cowgirls was lost,'' she said in an interview with The Dallas Observer in 1996.         So for six years she nurtured an exhibit in the Deaf Smith County Library. Then a Hereford couple donated their 6,000-square-foot house to hold the collection, which had expanded from bandannas and a few pistols to treasures like the red, white and blue rhinestone hat owned by an early Western music star, Patsy Montana, a yodeler whose recording of ''I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart'' sold a million copies.         Mrs. Formby was so enthusiastic about the project that she did not realize the difficulties she faced.         Visitors were few. ''We'd go for stretches, where for days on end, nobody would come,'' Mrs. Formby said in an interview with The Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 2002.         Money was scarce. Concerts, bake sales and renting the museum for social occasions did not raise enough. Licensing the name Cowgirl Hall of Fame to a Manhattan restaurant brought more honor than honorarium.         But Mrs. Formby kept adding to the little museum.         Her husband, Clint Formby, who owns the local country radio station, survives her, as do her sons Chip of Hereford, Marshall of Lubbock and Scott of Manhattan; her daughter, Mary Beth Powell of Hereford; and four grandchildren.         Mrs. Formby had to face a geographic truth: the hall of fame was a great idea but in the wrong place. So she and her board asked other cities if they were interested in having it. Thirty-five cities in six states responded. Fort Worth was chosen.         But as new people, many of them Fort Worth socialites, took over the museum, Mrs. Formby's role declined.         ''It's kind of like having a child and having to give that child up,'' she said in the Chronicle interview. ''It's sad.''       
         Nina Simone, a singer whose distinctively emotional style blended elements of jazz, gospel, blues, European art song and other influences, died yesterday at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, France, near Marseille. She was 70.         Her manager, Clifton Henderson, said she had been ill for some time, but he released no cause of death.         Ms. Simone had only one Top 20 hit in her long career -- her very first single, ''I Loves You, Porgy,'' released in 1959 -- but her following was large and loyal and her impact deep and lasting. Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack and Laura Nyro were among the singers who were influenced by her. In recent years her songs resurfaced and won new fans on television commercials and in dance-club remixes.         Although she was most often characterized as a jazz singer, Ms. Simone, who usually performed with a rhythm section and always accompanied herself on piano, was almost impossible to classify.         ''If I had to be called something,'' she wrote in 1991 in her autobiography, ''I Put a Spell on You,'' ''it should have been a folk singer because there was more folk and blues than jazz in my playing.''         But her piano playing also revealed her classical training more clearly than most jazz pianists', and her singing -- at times rough and raw, at other times sweet and pure -- owed an unmistakable debt to black gospel music. Her repertory was similarly eclectic: it ranged from blues to Broadway, from Jacques Brel to Screamin' Jay Hawkins to the Bee Gees.         Ms. Simone was as famous for her social consciousness as she was for her music. In the 1960's no musical performer was more closely identified with the civil rights movement. Though she was best known as an interpreter of other people's music, she eloquently expressed her feelings about racism and black pride in those years in a number of memorable songs she wrote herself.         ''Mississippi Goddam'' was an angry response to the killing of the civil rights advocate Medgar Evers. ''Young, Gifted and Black,'' written with the keyboardist Weldon Irvine Jr., became something of an anthem, recorded by Aretha Franklin and many others. ''Four Women'' painted a subtle but stinging picture of the suffering and the strength of African-American women.         She was born Eunice Waymon on Feb. 21, 1933, in Tryon, N.C., and grew up singing in a church choir and studying piano. She received a scholarship to the Juilliard School of Music in 1950, although she had to work as an accompanist for singers and as a piano teacher to help support herself. She eventually ran out of money, left Juilliard and moved back in with her family, at that time living in Philadelphia.         In 1954 she got a job playing piano at a bar and grill in Atlantic City, where she assumed her stage name -- because, she later explained, she did not want her mother to find out what she was doing. After her first night on the job, she was told that she had to sing as well as play, so she began emulating Billie Holiday and other singers she admired. She later said that she kept herself from getting frustrated with the often indifferent crowds by playing the piano in a manner ''as close to classical music as possible.'' This unusual mixture of approaches produced what the music writer Ashley Kahn has called ''an impassioned, impromptu approach that became her signature.''         Ms. Simone soon began to work in better venues and develop a devoted following. In 1958 she signed with Bethlehem Records; a few months later, she was on the pop charts. One of her best-remembered hits was ''My Baby Just Cares for Me.''         Her subsequent recordings for the Colpix, Philips and RCA Victor labels established her as a potent attraction on the cabaret, concert and festival circuits. Unafraid to speak her mind, she frequently clashed with promoters and occasionally berated her audiences for not paying attention, but her temperament did nothing to diminish her appeal.         Her survivors include three brothers, a sister and a daughter, Lisa, a singer and actress known professionally as Simone who is currently appearing on Broadway in ''Aida.''         In the 1970's her music fell out of fashion in the United States; she divorced her husband and manager, Andy Stroud, and beset by financial problems she left the country in 1973, living in Liberia and Barbados before settling in France. In a 1998 interview, she said she had left the United States because of a racial situation she called ''worse than ever.''         In recent years, as her health began to fail, Ms. Simone performed less and less, although she continued to draw enthusiastic crowds wherever she appeared. Al Schackman, who played guitar in her backup group for four decades, said she had recently canceled a tour of Britain but had been planning a United States tour for this spring.       
         Martha Wright Griffiths, a longtime United States representative who was a legend in Michigan Democratic politics and one of the most effective women's civil rights legislators of her day, died on Tuesday at her home in Armada, Mich. She was 91.         Known for her sharp intellect and blunt language, she entered Congress in 1955, was re-elected nine times and served through 1974, when she chose not to run again. She successfully fought to bring women under the protection of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, her crowning achievement in Congress.         Her persistence became a decisive factor in House approval of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution in 1970. It was her second triumph as a lawmaker, even though it remained a symbolic victory.         Mrs. Griffiths pursued passage of the amendment calmly, with the persuasive skills of the trial lawyer she once was. Her arguments went a long way toward persuading a male-dominated House to subscribe to a cause that had been on the table for 47 years, since women got the vote in 1923.         The Senate followed suit in 1972, and the proposed amendment then went to the states for approval. It gained a majority but fell three states short of the 38 needed for ratification.         Opponents of ratification raised the specter of economic ruin and combat duty for women, but Mrs. Griffiths continued the fight at the state level. She and Phyllis Schlafly, a principal opponent, sharply debated the issue at a national forum in 1976.         ''If we had five minutes more,'' said Rosemary Mullaney, one of the forum's organizers, ''they would have killed each other.''         For much of her life, Mrs. Griffiths scored firsts, like becoming the first woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee. She also sat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and was chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy.         Such key assignments gave her leverage to lobby for giving women specific protection under the Civil Rights Act. As proposed, the bill would have barred discrimination on the basis of race, religion or national origin; she led the drive to add ''sex'' as a listed category.         Mrs. Griffiths noted that inequalities could run either way, telling her colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee at one point, ''I am tired of paying into a pension fund to support your widow but not my widower.''         She ascribed part of her success to her husband and sometime law partner, Hicks G. Griffiths, who was once state Democratic chairman of Michigan. He died in 1996.         She was born Martha Wright in Pierce City, Mo., the daughter of a rural mail carrier, and became a champion debater in high school. She met Mr. Griffiths, a fellow student, at the University of Missouri, where both were on the debating team.         They eloped the year before she graduated in 1934. They studied law, and in 1940 were the first couple to graduate together from the University of Michigan Law School.         They went into practice in Detroit in 1946 as Griffiths & Griffiths. Another partner was G. Mennen Williams, whom they helped in his bid for governor in 1948. By then Mrs. Griffiths had lost her first race for the state Legislature.         She gained a seat in the state House, one of only two women in that chamber from 1949 to 1952, when she lost her first bid for Congress. Instead, Governor Williams appointed her to the bench of Recorder's Court in Detroit, and she was a judge until her election to the House in 1954, the first Democratic woman elected to Congress from Michigan.         After leaving Congress, she inhabited corporate boardrooms where few women had ever been members. She returned to politics in 1982, when James J. Blanchard, the Democratic candidate for governor, made her his running mate. She was elected lieutenant governor and re-elected with him in 1986.         Governor Blanchard's decision to replace her on his ticket in 1990 caused political furor in Michigan. Mr. Blanchard indicated that he had dropped her because of her age and increasing frailty, but Mrs. Griffiths, ever feisty, took issue and said women and the elderly had put Mr. Blanchard into office in the first place.         Mr. Blanchard narrowly lost the election to John M. Engler, a Republican.         ''I don't know if I feel vindicated, but I think it clearly shows that I won it for him the first two times,'' Mrs. Griffiths said after Mr. Blanchard's defeat. ''I feel bad for him, but he took some very bad advice.''       
         Elaine Anderson Steinbeck, who was one of the first women to become a Broadway stage manager and who in later years kept bright the artistic torch of her late husband John Steinbeck, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Steinbeck was active in the theater before her marriage to Mr. Steinbeck in 1950 and remained so after his death in 1968.         Elaine Anderson was born in Austin, Tex., on Aug. 14, 1914. She studied drama at the University of Texas, where she met her first husband, Zachary Scott, the actor, when both were involved in theater there. They were married in 1934 and several years later came east. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne had recommended the couple to Lawrence Langer of the Theater Guild. The result was a summer job at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut. Although the young Mrs. Scott had acting ambitions of her own, she began working for the Theater Guild so that her husband could pursue his acting career.         In the 1940's she was the stage manager of ''Oklahoma!,'' becoming one of the first women to achieve that position on Broadway. Soon after, she became one of the first women to take a show on the road, organizing and supervising the national tour of ''Othello'' with Paul Robeson.         The Scotts, who had a daughter, were divorced in 1949.         Mrs. Steinbeck met John Steinbeck during a visit to California in 1950. Mr. Steinbeck had been asked to escort Ava Gardner to a dinner party in Carmel and when Miss Gardner was unable to attend, the hostess asked to pick up the actress Ann Sothern and ''a friend.'' The friend was Elaine Anderson Scott. They were married that same year, and until his death, Mr. Steinbeck would often raise a glass at parties and offer a toast to Ava Gardner.         Mrs. Steinbeck, as the executor of the Steinbeck estate, worked to keep Steinbeck's work in print and promoted books about him. Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962.         She was also active in the Steinbeck Research Center at San Jose State University in California and in 1996 donated an archive of more than 200 letters sent to Steinbeck by John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman, Carl Sandburg, Alice B. Toklas, Ingrid Bergman and others.         Mrs. Steinbeck was a board member of the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, where she had a summer home.         She is survived by her daughter, Waverly Scott Kaffaga, of New York City; a stepson, Thomas Steinbeck; four grandchildren; and two sisters, Jean Boone of New York City and Frances Atkinson of Tuscaloosa, Ala.         Correction:  May 26, 2003, Monday  An obituary on April 29 about Elaine Anderson Steinbeck, a former stage manager and the widow of John Steinbeck, misspelled the surname of a co-founder of the Theater Guild, where she found work after first coming to New York, and misstated her job with the original Broadway production of ''Oklahoma!'' The co-founder was Lawrence Langner, not Langer. Ms. Steinbeck was a replacement assistant stage manager, not stage manager.       
         Muriel Topaz, the former director of the Dance Notation Bureau and the dance division of the Juilliard School, and an authority on the choreography of Antony Tudor, died on Monday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 70 and lived in Milford, Conn.         The cause was liver disease, said her son, Daniel Druckman.         Though trained as a performer and choreographer, a passion for preserving dances through notation dominated much of Ms. Topaz's career.         In a polemical statement to the 1982 conference of the Dance Critics Association in New York, she asked, ''Is choreography an evanescent form existing only in the bodies and personalities of the initial performers, or does it, like all other performing art forms, have a substance, a compositional integrity that transcends the initial performance?''         ''For surely, if it does,'' she continued, ''there can be no question of our obligation to document and pass on that art form to future generations.''         She championed the notation system known as Labanotation (invented by Rudolf von Laban in the 1920's), yet she urged choreographers to record dances in any way that might be comprehensible to others. In an interview with The New York Times in 1985, she said, ''Most of the revivals we see are possible only because someone at some time wrote something down.''         Ms. Topaz's convictions led her to notate works by more than 25 choreographers, including such diverse figures as George Balanchine, Gower Champion, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, José Limón, Jerome Robbins, Paul Taylor and Tudor.         She felt a special affinity for Tudor, the British-born choreographer who created major productions for American Ballet Theater. Last year, she published a study of his achievements, ''Undimmed Luster: The Life of Antony Tudor'' (Scarecrow Press), and at the time of her death she was reconstructing as much as possible of ''The Planets,'' a legendary Tudor ballet that has not been performed since the 1940's.         Ms. Topaz was born in Philadelphia. She studied ballet and modern dance there and at New York University and Juilliard. She retained close ties to Juilliard, serving as the rehearsal director of the Juilliard Dance Ensemble from 1966 to 1970 and directing its dance divison from 1985 to 1992, succeeding Martha Hill, the department's founder.         Long associated with the Dance Notation Bureau in New York, Ms. Topaz was director of its Labanotation studies from 1970 to 1978 and its excutive director from 1978 to 1985. She also organized international notation conferences in Tel Aviv (1984) and Hong Kong (1990).         Ms. Topaz received a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1998, served as a panelist for many cultural organizations, including the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the New York State State Council on the Arts, and was an auditor for the National Endowment for the Arts. She adjudicated dance festivals across America and frequently wrote for dance publications.         Ms. Topaz's husband, the composer Jacob Druckman, died in 1996. In addition to her son, of Orangeburg, N.Y., she is survived by a daughter, Karen S. Jeanneret-Druckman, of Rolle, Switzerland, and three grand-daughters.       
         The performer who used the stage name Pepper LaBeija as a glamorous queen of the Harlem drag balls immortalized in the 1991 documentary ''Paris Is Burning'' died on May 14 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She, as she preferred to be called, was 53.         A woman who answered the telephone at her mother's home but who would not identify herself said the cause of death was a heart attack.         Miss LaBeija (pronounced la-BAY-zha) appeared proudly in luxuriant female garb that was often golden and shimmering, and referred to herself in feminine terms, her friend Marcel Christian LaBeija said.         Marcel's given name is Herman Williams, but the last name of LaBeija is used by all members of the House of LaBeija, the group of performers Pepper led.         When Pepper LaBeija was not onstage, she was William Jackson of the Bronx, who sometimes dressed as a man.         Pepper was the last of the four great queens of the modern Harlem balls; Angie Xtravaganza, Dorian Corey and Avis Pendavis all died in recent years. These four exuded a sort of wild expressionism that might make Las Vegas showgirls seem tame.         ''This is the end of the golden age,'' said Brian Lantelme, a photographer who has covered the balls.         The House of LaBeija was one of the first houses, founded in 1970. The female impersonator who first led it thought the name LaBeija seemed glamorous. Pepper took over in 1971 or 1972, Marcel said.         Pepper LaBeija was called ''mother''; the house's younger members were the ''children.''         ''A house is a family for those who don't have a family,'' Miss LaBeija said in the movie.         Marcel LaBeija and Mr. Lantelme said that Pepper was also survived by a son and daughter, but did not know these survivors' names.         Miss LaBeija had diabetes, which had led to the amputation of both feet, and had been bedridden for most of the last decade. She last performed at a ball in 2001, when 30 attendants delivered her on a litter to the crowd's jubilation.         ''Her specialty was the Egyptian effect,'' Marcel LaBeija said.         Pepper LaBeija was a legend to the members and patrons of the Harlem ball scene, a world of extravagant make-believe that crosses sexual boundaries and that was chronicled in ''Paris Is Burning,'' directed by Jennie Livingston. In an interview, Ms. Livingston spoke of Pepper's ''glamorous bravado'' that stood out in a flock of Marilyn Monroes.         The public also glimpsed the ball scene in a Madonna video that featured voguing, a highly stylized and posed dance form used in the balls. Voguing was also featured at the Love Balls, which were held at Roseland in 1989 and 1990 and drew top fashion industry figures.         Though men have long dressed as women for many reasons, the modern institution of the Harlem ball began around 1960, said Marcel LaBeija, who is writing a book on the subject. The idea was to give gay blacks and Hispanics a place to dress up and perform. An earlier circuit for drag performers had been geared to white people, and black performers had sometimes whitened their faces to fit in.         The new balls did more than add racial justice. They set up changing categories within which to compete; these sometimes included Town & Country types, military personnel, corporate executives, schoolgirls and schoolboys and fashion models.         Trophies were awarded to those who best achieved ''realness,'' or resemblance to an archetype. The paradox was more bitter than sweet: performers strove to become the very people who would reject them. The best won trophies; no one won more than Miss LaBeija, who took away around 250, mostly for extravagant takes on high fashion.         Like many such performers, she had surgically implanted breasts. But she did not want a sex-change operation, explaining that women don't have it so great.         The drag ball scene, as portrayed in ''Paris Is Burning,'' had its sad aspects as well. One man says that the biggest ''realness'' a man can attain is to be convincing enough to make it home on the subway without getting beaten up for being in costume.         For most of her life, Miss LaBeija's world was the balls. Marcel said that Pepper supported herself by producing them and by teaching modeling.         In an interview with The Village Voice in 2000, Miss LaBeija said her life had grown more ordinary, and called herself an ''old-way legend in recovery.'' Without mentioning her disabled status, she volunteered that she had even given up shoplifting designer clothes, called ''mopping'' by performers who rely on the practice.         ''You mop, you get locked,'' she explained.         Correction:  May 28, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday about Pepper LaBeija, a leading performer at drag balls in Harlem, misattributed comments in a Village Voice interview about giving up shoplifting of high-fashion garments. They were made by Gerald Dupree LaBeija, a member of the House of LaBeija troupe, not by Pepper LaBeija.       
         Rachel Kempson, the matriarch of the Redgrave acting clan and one of the clarion voices of British stage and screen, died on Saturday at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 92.         Miss Kempson was perhaps the least known of the Redgraves in the United States. But in Britain her performances in large and small roles in Shakespeare's plays were greatly admired, as were her appearances in other treasured British classics, including Richard Sheridan's 1777 comedy, ''The School for Scandal,'' in which she appeared over the years both as Maria and, earlier, as Lady Teazle. She also performed in plays like ''Not for Children'' (Belfast, 1955), ''The Seagull'' and ''Saint Joan of the Stockyards'' (London, 1964) and ''The Old Country'' (London, 1977).         Americans knew her mostly through her work in motion pictures and in television presentations like ''Lady Randolph Churchill,'' PBS, 1975; ''The Jewel in the Crown,'' Masterpiece Theater, PBS, 1984; ''Jane Eyre,'' Hallmark Hall of Fame, NBC, 1971; and ''Camille,'' CBS, 1984. Her movies that were best known in America included ''Tom Jones'' (1963), ''Georgy Girl'' (1966) and ''Out of Africa'' (1985).         In her 1986 memoir, ''Life Among the Redgraves,'' Miss Kempson said: ''I have never quite belonged anywhere. I think it is to do with my lack of an important ingredient: a tough ego.''         But her ego and sense of belonging were very much in evidence one London evening in 1973, when she was appearing in a new John Osborne play, ''A Sense of Detachment.'' Two young men in the audience began to heckle Lady Redgrave, who was then 62 years old. According to a short item in The New York Times, she became annoyed with them, jumped from the stage and ''pummeled her detractors.''         Although she seemed to many to be a properly reserved, traditional Englishwoman, her 50-year marriage to Sir Michael Redgrave was anything but traditional.         She so totally loved Sir Michael that early in their relationship, in the early 1930's, she proposed marriage to him, even though she knew he was bisexual and given to escapades. Mr. Redgrave at first ''was worried,'' she later wrote, and hesitant about marrying her. ''He said there were difficulties in his nature and he felt he ought not to marry,'' she continued.         But she said she told him she understood, and added, ''It doesn't matter to me -- I love you so.'' Whereupon he replied, ''Very well, if you are sure, we will.'' And so they did, in 1935. Over the years, Lady Redgrave wrote, she and her husband endured their respective dalliances, and the marriage lasted until his death in 1985.         Lady Redgrave is survived by three children, the actors Vanessa, Corin and Lynn Redgrave, 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         Rachel Kempson was born in Dartmouth, Devon, on May 28, 1910, the daughter of Eric William Kempson, an educator, and the former Beatrice Hamilton Ashwell. Part of her education came in a convent school, and it was there that she first became interested in the theater.         As a young woman she was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and worked hard there to learn acting, though she complained the classes were too large.         Her work onstage earned her a prize, and in 1932 she was sent to Stratford-on-Avon, where she appeared in six of Shakespeare's plays. In a single year she played a witch in ''Macbeth,'' a dancer in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' Phoebe in ''As You Like It,'' a lady-in-waiting in ''Richard II,'' Virginia in ''Coriolanus'' and Hero in ''Much Ado About Nothing.''         She met several young, promising directors there, among them Tyrone Guthrie, who was still in his 20's.         After doing a Shakespeare production at Oxford, she was asked to play opposite Michael Redgrave in John Van Druten's ''Flowers of the Forest.''         She was immediately taken with him and vividly recalled what he said to her when they were first introduced: ''Oh, good, you're tall. I thought you were going to be tiny.''         Correction:  May 30, 2003, Friday  An obituary on Monday about Rachel Kempson, a British actress and matriarch of the Redgrave acting clan, misstated the name of a character she played in Shakespeare's ''Coriolanus'' in 1932. It was Virgilia, not Virginia.       
         Erika Fromm, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and an expert on the use of hypnosis in therapy, died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 93.         Dr. Fromm considered hypnosis a valuable analytical tool that, when used by a skilled practitioner, could provide access to a patient's unconscious conflicts and desires. She said hypnosis could induce an altered state of consciousness involving heightened awareness and focus in approximately 1 in 12 people.         She used hypnosis to treat severely disturbed patients as well as victims of incest and those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders. She also advocated self-hypnosis as a path to self-exploration.         In the 1980's, Dr. Fromm joined the growing field of behavioral medicine, which uses hypnosis, meditation, biofeedback and other techniques to treat physical ailments. Her book ''Hypnosis and Behavioral Medicine,'' written with Dr. Daniel P. Brown and published in 1987, presented research supporting those methods in treating allergies, asthma, migraines and hypertension.         She was the longtime editor of the journal Research Developments and Perspectives in Hypnosis. Her books include ''Dream Interpretation: A New Approach'' (1964), written with Dr. Thomas French; ''Hypnotherapy and Hypnoanalysis'' (1986), written with Dr. Brown; and ''Self-Hypnosis: The Chicago Paradigm'' (1990), written with Dr. Stephen Kahn. Her final book, ''Changes in the Therapist'' (2000), also written with Dr. Kahn, looked at the impact that patients can have on their therapists.         Born Erika Oppenheimer in Frankfurt, Germany, on Dec. 23, 1909, she received her doctorate in psychology from the University of Frankfurt in 1933. Alarmed by Nazism, she moved to the Netherlands that year and to the United States in 1938. She was a research assistant in psychiatry at the University of Chicago from 1939 to 1940, then spent years in practice and joined the university's faculty in 1961.         Her husband was Paul Fromm, a cousin of the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and the founder of the Fromm Music Foundation at Harvard, which supports contemporary composers. He died in 1987. Her daughter, Joan Fromm Greenstone, died in 1996. She is survived by a sister, Clementina Kro of Israel; three brothers, Walter Oppenheimer of Germany, Asher Oppenheimer of Israel and John Ormond of Piedmont, Calif.; two grandsons; and two great-grandsons.       
         Sue Sally Hale, who broke American polo's sex barrier in 1972 when she gained membership in the sport's national governing body after playing matches disguised as a man for two decades, died last Tuesday at her ranch in Coachella, Calif. She was 65.         The cause was a ruptured aorta, her former husband, Alex Hale, said.         When Hale was growing up in Southern California, polo retained an image as a rich man's sport. But the United States Polo Association, the national governing agency, now lists some 600 women among its membership of 3,600. And the Hale family remains a major presence. Hale's daughter Sunny Hale is one of the leading women's players in the world, having competed with men at polo's premier event, the United States Open.         Hale was reared amid the glitter of Hollywood's polo set. Her father, Grover Jones, a well-known screenwriter, and her mother, Susan Avery, a former ballerina, wasted no time introducing her to the sport.         ''I had my first horse at 3,'' Hale told The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., earlier this year.         Her father died at about that time, and her mother later married Richard Talmadge, a motion-picture stuntman and actor. The glamorous matches at the Riviera Country Club were close at hand, but Hale did more than watch. She was ready to compete with men by the time she reached her early teens.         But women were not welcome except for minor club matches, so she applied mascara to her lip to simulate a mustache, wore oversized shirts and pulled her hair up under her helmet. She competed under the name A. Jones, her real identity known only to her teammates at first, although it eventually became clear in the polo world that A. Jones was really Hale.         ''After a game it was a kick to clean up for the parties and mingle unrecognized with the guys I'd just played on the field with,'' she told The Los Angeles Times years later.         Hale's repeated efforts to gain admission to the United States Polo Association were rebuffed. But her friends in the polo world applied pressure as well -- a lawsuit was threatened, as she recalled -- and in 1972 the association admitted her as its first woman.         Hale became a leading player, and in December 1990 she and her daughters Sunny and Stormie, along with France's leading polo-playing woman, Caroline Anier, won the first United States Women's Open.         Hale also coached polo teams at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and at the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Santa Ana, Calif., and provided polo lessons for handicapped people.         Capt. Caryll G. Rice II, the secretary of the Marine team she coached in the mid-1990's, recalled her enthusiasm. ''She had us posting without stirrups in the middle of August out in the desert,'' he wrote in Marines magazine. '' 'Come on, it'll be fun,' she said.''         Her marriage to Alex Hale, of Carmel, Calif., ended in divorce in 1976.         In addition to Sunny, of Norman, Okla., and Coral Gables, Fla., and Stormie, of Pacific Grove, Calif., she is survived by another daughter, Dawn, of Pacific Grove; a son, Trails, of Simi Valley, Calif.; a brother, Harold Jones, of Palm Desert, Calif.; and three grandchildren.         Hale worked to organize tournaments for women. Late in 1972, when her team played in Florida against a squad from the East Coast, the emotions were overwhelming.         ''We all just sat and cried,'' she told The Press-Enterprise, ''because we didn't think we'd ever get to play. Those were great games at that tournament. And that's where women's polo really started.''       
         Suzy Parker, the willowy, red-headed beauty whose elegant poses on scores of magazine covers defined glamour in the 1950's and paved the way for the supermodels to follow, died on Saturday at her home in Montecito, Calif. She was 69.         Her husband, the actor Bradford Dillman, said she had suffered from a number of serious ailments over the last six years.         In the period just after World War II, models were becoming celebrities. Fashion's influence was inexorably expanding from high society to society at large, and Suzy Parker, along with other models like Dovima and Lisa Fonssagrives, signified a postwar world of stylish promise for all. When Miss Parker posed in one of fashion's first bikini shots, America noticed.         Miss Parker was the first model to make more than $100 an hour and $100,000 a year, said Eileen Ford, the doyenne of modeling agents. She also worked as a professional photographer and editor, and she appeared in lead roles in movies with Cary Grant and Gary Cooper.         Ms. Ford said she was simply staggered when the famed model Dorian Leigh, Miss Parker's oldest sister, introduced her to Suzy, then 15.         ''She was the most beautiful creature you can imagine,'' Ms. Ford said. ''She was everybody's everything.''         Miss Parker's trademark in photographs and later on the movie screen was icy sophistication, often likened to that of Grace Kelly, but in person she exuded a girl-next-door prettiness and a sort of wacky loquaciousness. Audrey Hepburn's role in ''Funny Face,'' as a fast-talking beatnik who somewhat unwillingly becomes a world-famous model, was inspired by her, and she made a cameo appearance in the film, her first movie role.         Miss Parker adored slouch hats of the sort favored by Garbo and collected Coco Chanel's classic designs for herself. Richard Avedon, the photographer, called her ''my most challenging and complicated of muses.''         Cecilia Ann Renee Parker was born in San Antonio on Oct. 28, 1933. While still in high school in Jacksonville, Fla., she modeled in the summers for Ford Models, and after graduation went to work full time for the agency. In a silent profession Miss Parker was outspoken.         ''Suzy Parker didn't stop talking when I first tried to take her picture,'' Horst, the photographer, said. ''I said, 'You keep talking,' and I left. When she got into the movies, I joked that maybe she would do for the movies what she would never do for me -- hold still.''         She publicly condemned drinking and smoking and said marriage killed romance. The New York Daily News reported her lecturing a French economist about the French economy. She said she talked too much for most men.         Her often-quoted remark that she could love a man more when she was not married to him exploded in headlines when it turned out she was secretly married.         That marriage, to Pierre de la Salle in 1958, was actually her second; she had been briefly married to a high school sweetheart. She and Mr. de la Salle, from whom she was later divorced, had a daughter, Georgia, of Paris, who survives her.         In 1963 she married Mr. Dillman, who survives her, along with their daughter, Dinah Kaufman of Irvine, Calif.; their sons Charles, of Los Angeles, and Christopher, of Encinitas, Calif.; and four grandchildren.         Her sisters Dorian Leigh of Paris and Florian Boice of Annapolis, Md., also survive her.         Miss Parker said she looked in the mirror each day and thanked God for her cheekbones. But she insisted that she modeled only for money and had other professional ambitions. In the mid-1950's she temporarily abandoned being a cover girl for several years to be a photographer herself, apprenticing with Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris and working for the French edition of Vogue.         It was through Mr. Avedon that Miss Parker parlayed her modeling fame into a movie career. As visual consultant in the movie ''Funny Face,'' Mr. Avedon selected her for a brief but conspicuous appearance. Written by Leonard Gershe and directed by Stanley Donen, the 1957 film depicted a high-fashion photographer not unlike Mr. Avedon, played by Fred Astaire. Miss Parker was the inspiration for Audrey Hepburn's character in the film, a somewhat kooky intellectual and free spirit.         Hepburn, in turn, became such a cheerleader that Miss Parker called the actress her ''Hollywood press agent.''         Miss Parker was cast opposite Cary Grant in ''Kiss Them for Me'' in 1957, getting bad reviews. She appeared with Gary Cooper the next year in ''Ten North Frederick.'' This time, Bosley Crowther in The New York Times said she underplayed her part ''neatly.''         She appeared in 1959 in ''The Best of Everything,'' based on Rona Jaffe's novel. In 1961 she played opposite Mr. Dillman in ''A Circle of Deception.'' They wed in 1963.         Miss Parker was in several more movies and became a sought-after television guest in the 1960's. Her most famous television appearance was in a 1963 episode of ''Twilight Zone'' in which she played six different parts.         She retired from acting in the mid-1960's and moved with Mr. Dillman to the Santa Barbara area.         In his book ''Cover Girls and Supermodels, 1945-1965'' (Marion Boyars, 1996), the French journalist Jean-Noël Liaut said Miss Parker had escaped the unhappy outcomes of other stellar models.         He wrote, ''She became a perfect housewife, even to the extent of baking her own bread.''       
         Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, a lawyer and psychiatrist who founded the drug treatment program Odyssey House and went on to give widely quoted but sometimes disputed testimony on subjects like child abuse and pornography, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Dr. Sarah Baden, who added that her mother lived in Westport, Conn., and had come to New York for Mother's Day.         In 1966, Dr. Densen-Gerber founded Odyssey House, one of the earlier drug-free therapeutic communities that helped addicts recover. She was a leading advocate of such programs, which involved group residence and group therapy, as opposed to methadone-maintenance programs.         She got to know Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller when she picketed in front of his house to demand funds for her program, and they became friends. In the 1970's she became a conspicuous figure at public hearings, society balls and ghetto demonstrations with her bouffant hairdo, rhinestone-studded glasses and cigars.         A 1979 profile in New York magazine quoted Mayor Edward I. Koch as saying that she was ''one of those seminal forces, original, a go-getter.'' He said there were ''few people who can claim as many accomplishments.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber's success at getting government help became her downfall when the state investigated her use of public funds in the early 1980's and found irregularities. She resigned as executive director of Odyssey House in 1983, but remained active in affiliated programs.         Her influence extended to areas like child pornography. In 1977, her testimony that there were 264 monthly publications devoted to the subject helped persuade the House of Representatives to unanimously pass a bill to regulate it.         IPT, the publication of the Institute for Psychological Therapy, reported in 1992 that later government investigations proved her estimates to be exaggerated by ''several orders of magnitude.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber also commented on many other hot issues from a psychiatric point of view.         In 1991, she went to Omaha to testify in court that her interview with a man convinced her he had witnessed four satanic ritual killings. She characterized herself as an expert at deprogramming survivors of satanic cults.         In 1997, she appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television program to analyze a videotape of JonBenet Ramsey in a children's beauty contest.         Her unorthodox approach extended to her psychiatric practice. In 1999, she agreed to pay $200,000 to settle a civil lawsuit over her inability to account for 1,270 vials of medicinal cocaine. She denied any violation of the law.         She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1934. Her mother, Beatrice Densen, who had kept her own name, was an heiress of the Densen paper-box fortune. Her father, Gustave Gerber, a chemical engineer, became a lawyer in his 40's and was considering studying medicine in his 60's.         Dr. Densen-Gerber's parents persuaded her to study law before supporting her through medical school. She graduated from Columbia Law School and New York University Medical School. She did her residency at Metropolitan Hospital, where during one of her pregnancies, the director suggested she spend an hour or two a day working with addicts. That led to her assembling, in 1966, a group of addicts who wanted to cure themselves without using drugs. Before she found a home for them, they slept in 11 temporary shelters, giving rise to the name Odyssey.         Her original capital was $3.82, and dinner was often rice and spaghetti. Her first permanent building, on East 109th Street, was rented for $17 a month. There were 17 residents.         Within four years, other Odyssey Houses had started to spring up in other cities. In New York, Dr. Densen-Gerber reached out to new populations like prostitutes and addicted mothers.         Her own celebrity grew, and in 1981 The New York Times noted her costume at the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria. She wore a leather lionlike mask and a lionlike coiffure.         By the next year, Dr. Densen-Gerber faced stiff challenges. She agreed to pay back $20,000 in excessive personal expenses to close a state investigation. News reports suggested she had become intoxicated with her own power.         ''I remember her grandly lying back and being grande dame to all the peons who were lying around,'' Nancy Hoving, a former member of Odyssey's advisory council, said in a New York magazine interview.         In 1997, her marriage to Michael Baden, who had been the city's medical examiner and a top forensic official for the state police, burned out in a flurry of lawsuits and spectacular accusations.         The marriage's beginning had also been unusual. Mr. Baden said in an interview with The Daily News in 1989 that he took her to an autopsy on their first date and proposed by phone while assisting in the post-mortem on the bullet-riddled body of the mobster Albert Anastasia.         In addition to her daughter Sarah, Dr. Densen-Gerber is survived by another daughter, Trissa Baden of Hopewell, N.J.; a son, Lindsey, of Brookline, Mass.; and two grandchildren.       
         Dame Wendy Hiller, the distinguished English stage and screen actress who was George Bernard Shaw's choice to play two of his most famous heroines, Eliza Doolittle and Major Barbara, died on Wednesday at her home in Beaconsfield, England. She was 90.         Dame Wendy's performances were celebrated for spirit and integrity, and she became a major film personality despite only a handful of starring roles in movies.         In her 20's, she became an international film star by playing Eliza, the celebrated Cockney flower seller, exchanging barbs and grimaces with Henry Higgins (Leslie Howard) in the 1938 film of ''Pygmalion,'' and an heiress turned Salvation Army worker, matching wits with her professorial fiancé (Rex Harrison), in ''Major Barbara'' (1941).         Dame Wendy was also memorable for her broad cheekbones and impeccable enunciation, in a warm but somewhat quavering voice. She cemented her fame by playing a materialist turned romantic in a lyrical 1945 film, ''I Know Where I'm Going!,'' and a lonely but resilient hotelkeeper in ''Separate Tables'' (1958), which earned her an Academy Award as best supporting actress.         She played an obsessive mother in ''Sons and Lovers'' (1960), a steadfast wife in ''A Man for All Seasons'' (1966), a fussy Russian princess in ''Murder on the Orient Express'' (1974) and a compassionate nurse in ''The Elephant Man'' (1980).         Her other films included ''Outcast of the Islands'' (1952), ''Something of Value'' (1957), ''Toys in the Attic'' (1963), a television adaptation of ''David Copperfield'' (1969), ''Voyage of the Damned'' (1976), ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1979) and ''The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987). Her last movie, in 1992, was the television film ''The Countess Alice,'' in which she played the title role, a former society beauty who is interviewed 50 years after her fame.         Dame Wendy said she had tried to make only films that were ''rather special and have stature,'' and to play only roles that were ''undull.'' She repeatedly rejected parts she did not believe in and passionately pursued those she liked.         She was also noted for carefully shaping and defining memorable characters. Basil Rathbone, who starred with her in the play ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square,'' said he had never rehearsed with any performer who worked with such concentration, adding, ''She shuts everything else out in a most absolute way.''         Shaw chose her to star in his plays ''St. Joan'' and ''Pygmalion'' in a 1936 festival at Malvern, Worcester, before selecting her for the film adaptations of ''Pygmalion'' and ''Major Barbara.'' She described him as ''a most approachable and understanding person who talked to me a good deal.''         Dame Wendy recalled that at the age of 81, Shaw would stay up to all hours watching rehearsals of ''St. Joan.'' ''Once,'' she said, ''it was 3 in the morning when we finished rehearsing, and Shaw came up on the stage and said quietly, 'If you'd like to go through that again, I'd like to listen.' We were pale gray, and he was pink and fresh and blooming.''         ''He's a wonderful actor,'' she said. ''He used to act out all the parts, and he always put us to shame. He's also a cruel mimic. Once he gave me a demonstration of my walk; he said I walked like a schoolmistress. He made me feel the way I walked, and I never walked like that again.''         Wendy Hiller was born on Aug. 15, 1912, in Bramhall, a Cheshire town. Her father, Frank Watkin Hiller, a cotton-cloth manufacturer, and her mother, the former Marie Elizabeth Stone, also had three sons, René, Michael and John.         After completing secondary school, Wendy joined the Manchester Repertory Theater, where she was a bit player and later an assistant stage manager. Over the next five years, she won increasingly important roles and gained her first starring part, as the Lancashire heroine in ''Love on the Dole,'' an adaptation of Walter Greenwood's novel. Her acclaimed performance helped make the play a hit in London in 1935 and on Broadway in 1936.         A year later, she married Ronald Gow, one of the two writers who adapted the work for the stage. They had two children and lived quietly in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Mr. Gow died in 1993, and Dame Wendy's survivors include their daughter, Ann, and their son, Anthony.         She often limited her film and theater work to be with her family, but remarked to an interviewer that it was ''impossible to make a success'' of both home and career all the time.         ''Pygmalion,'' which was later the basis for the Lerner and Loewe musical ''My Fair Lady,'' gave Dame Wendy some of her finest scenes. As a reformed Cockney, she passes her tryout tea party by stressing her ''H's'' precisely while informing her guests that ''in Hampshire, Hereford and Hartford, hurricanes hardly ever happen,'' her famous elocution lesson.         In a later scene, she artfully blends pride and tension at a ball where she winningly impersonates a grand lady, conveying a stunning character transformation. The actress graciously credited this change entirely to Shaw, saying: ''He changes Eliza mentally. That is why the change is so profound.''         In World War II, Dame Wendy went on extensive factory tours throughout Britain, appearing as Viola in ''Twelfth Night.'' Later, on Broadway, her critical and popular triumphs included ''The Heiress'' (1947), ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' (1957), ''Flowering Cherry'' (1959) and ''The Aspern Papers'' (1962), another James adaptation. In 1975, Queen Elizabeth II named her a Dame of the British Empire.         Dame Wendy's occasional television roles included an imperious but vulnerable principal of a women's college in a 1983 mystery, ''Miss Morison's Ghosts.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, John J. O'Connor said she had ''reached that stage of her career where she can make the tiniest gesture speak volumes.''         He added, ''Her performance is the equivalent of a master class in acting.''       
         Dorothy Nelkin, a New York University sociologist who chronicled the uneasy relationship between science and society, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the university said.         Professor Nelkin, a prolific author who began her research at Cornell in 1963, was a close observer of science and how it is perceived -- and, often, misperceived -- by the public.         As a practical matter, that often involved giving warnings about the potential dangers posed by scientific advances that proceed unchecked by careful discussion of their implications. In an interview last year, she said it was hardly surprising that many nonscientists were unnerved by the commercialization of the human body, as scientists seek patents for genes and tissues.         ''If you are looking at the public image of the mad scientist or the scientist out of control,'' she said, ''the issue of patenting has aroused a lot of concerns. The public concern doesn't just come out of space. It comes out of real things that are happening.''         But Professor Nelkin, whose husband of 50 years, Mark Nelkin, is a physicist, was no enemy of science. Although her academic background was in the humanities and the social sciences, she was generally comfortable in the world of science, especially biology. Still, she kept her intellectual distance, believing that lay writers often had a tendency to lionize science.         ''She always saw science in relationship to society, and she never went native,'' said Prof. Troy Duster, a sociologist at N.Y.U.         Dorothy Wolfers Nelkin was born on July 30, 1933, in Boston and raised in Brookline, Mass. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell, where she met her husband. In addition to Mr. Nelkin, she is survived by a daughter, Lisa Nelkin of Baltimore; a sister, Nancy Wolfers of London; and a granddaughter.         Although she never earned more than a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Cornell, Professor Nelkin rose to hold one of N.Y.U.'s highest ranks, university professor.         She wrote or co-wrote 26 books, including ''Selling Science: How the Press Covers Science and Technology,'' ''The DNA Mystique: The Gene as a Cultural Icon'' and ''Body Bazaar: The Market for Human Tissue in the Biotechnology Age.'' She also served as an adviser to the federal government's Human Genome Project. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1983.         Much of her work focused on the friction between science and technology and the public. In the early years, she might have looked at how the location for a nuclear plant was chosen or workers' attitudes toward their safety. Over the past decade, though, her focus narrowed on DNA breakthroughs and their effect on the public. She recently began exploring the aesthetic of DNA, and its increasing depiction in art and popular culture.         The goal, colleagues said, was to lend perspective to a public alternately smitten and scared by scientific advances.         Professor Nelkin believed that the science would be unable to live up to the hopes floated by its promoters, many of whom stood to make a lot of money.         She worried, too, about the civil liberties issues raised by efforts to amass databases of people's DNA for crime-fighting purposes. And she was a firm skeptic about efforts to link behavior, especially criminal behavior, to heredity.         ''By making social factors irrelevant,'' she wrote, ''genetic explanations of crime provide convenient excuses for those seeking to dismantle the welfare state.''       
         Katharine Hepburn, the actress whose independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of women and a beloved heroine to filmgoers for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 96 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Her physical presence was distinctive, her often-imitated voice filled with the vowels of a well-bred New Englander, and her sharp-planed face defined by remarkably high cheekbones. In her youth she did not have classical leading-lady looks, but a handsome beauty. In old age she was a familiar figure with her hair, gradually changing from auburn to gray, always in a topknot and her boyish figure always in the trousers that she helped to make fashionable.         She played sharp-witted, sophisticated women with an ease that suggested that there was a thin line between the movie role and the off-screen personality. The romantic comedy ''The Philadelphia Story'' and the screwball classic ''Bringing Up Baby'' were among her best, most typical roles. But through 43 films and dozens of stage and television appearances, she played comic and dramatic parts as varied as Jo in ''Little Women,'' the reborn spinster Rosie in ''The African Queen'' and Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter.''         Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day. Tracy was unhappily married and the father of two when they met, and he remained married until the end of his life. He and Miss Hepburn lived together for 27 years, until his death in 1967, and made nine films together.         ''Woman of the Year,'' ''Adam's Rib'' and ''Pat and Mike'' are typically bright and biting Tracy-Hepburn collaborations. She is wickedly smart, slightly aloof and emotionally vulnerable. He is commonsensical, down-to-earth and deeply decent. He manages to bring her down a peg; she never minds.         Hepburn and Tracy, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''so beautifully complemented each other'' that their relationship ''never seemed to be a matter of capitulation.'' Rather, he added, it was ''a matter of understanding and acknowledging each other's boundaries.''         The frisson of their off-screen romance, always hinted at but never acknowledged during his lifetime, followed them on screen and became especially poignant when they played a married couple in their last movie together, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' Tracy died just 17 days after they had finished filming it.         Through most of her career, Miss Hepburn had a reputation for being private and elusive with the press. In fact, she frequently granted interviews, although she was reticent about her personal life. But after the death of Tracy's wife, Louise, in 1983, Miss Hepburn felt free to discuss the love affair.         In later years she spoke openly about her life and career, especially in her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Although admittedly sketchy rather than a comprehensive memoir, the book captured the qualities that endeared Miss Hepburn to audiences: a conversational tone, a no-nonsense attitude and disarming candor. The autobiography became a best seller, a tribute to her enduring appeal across generational lines.         In 1993 she appeared in an autobiographical television documentary, ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me,'' made for the TNT cable network. She began: ''So this is about Katharine Hepburn, public, private. Can you tell which is which?'' She added, laughing, ''Sometimes I wonder myself.''         Longing to Be a Boy         Katharine Houghton Hepburn was born into a close family whose comfortable social status and unconventional opinions fostered self-confidence and independence. Her father, Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn, was a Hartford surgeon and a pioneer in fighting venereal disease. Her mother, Katharine Houghton, was a suffragist and a strong advocate of birth control.         In ''Me,'' Miss Hepburn finally revealed her age. ''I was born May 12, 1907,'' she wrote, ''despite everything I may have said to the contrary.'' For years she had said she was two years younger and had given her birthday as Nov. 8. That was the birthday of her older brother, Tom, who died at 16. Miss Hepburn, then 14, found his body hanging from the rafters of a house the family was visiting in New York City. The Hepburns said they never knew whether he had committed suicide and left open the possibility that he had been practicing a magic trick.         Although the family always called her Kathy or Kath, one summer Miss Hepburn so hated being a little girl that she cut her hair and called herself Jimmy. ''I thought being a girl was really the bunk,'' she said in an interview. ''But there's no bunk about Jimmy.''         After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1928, she had small parts in stock theater companies. She was dismissed from more than one play when she was starting out, but she retained supreme self-confidence. Late in life, she laughingly said of her younger self, ''I am terribly afraid I just assumed I'd be famous.''         She was first noticed professionally in her role as Antiope in the play ''The Warrior's Husband,'' a Greek fable in which she entered by descending a narrow staircase, carrying a stag over her shoulder.         That role led to a Hollywood screen test and her first film role, as John Barrymore's daughter in ''A Bill of Divorcement'' (1932). It was directed by George Cukor, who become one of her dearest friends (she and Tracy lived for years in the guest house on Cukor's Hollywood estate) and the director of many of her films, including ''Little Women.'' He once recalled of her screen test: ''She was unlike anybody I'd ever seen or heard. I was rather moved by the test, although the performance wasn't that good. But I thought, 'That girl is rather interesting.' ''         Fast Rise to Stardom         Miss Hepburn became a movie star quickly. She won an Academy Award for her role as Eva Lovelace, the naïve aspiring actress who learns a tough lesson about survival, in the 1933 film ''Morning Glory,'' only her third movie. Over the years she was nominated for a dozen Oscars, a record unbeaten until Meryl Streep received her 13th nomination this year. Miss Hepburn won three more, for ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''The Lion in Winter'' and ''On Golden Pond,'' but never showed up to collect any of them.         When she was 84, she looked back at those early days and, with her trademark tough-mindedness, said: ''In the beginning I had money; I wasn't a poor little thing. I don't know what I would have done if I'd had to come to New York and get a job as a waiter or something like that. I think I'm a success, but I had every advantage; I should have been.''         She also credited her husband with helping her get started in her career. For most of her life, the public thought she had never married. In fact, in 1928 she married Ludlow Ogden Smith, a member of a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She immediately made him change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow, partly because she didn't want to be known as Kate Smith.         They led separate lives long before their divorce in 1934, but they remained friendly. The town house they bought together in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan was Miss Hepburn's home until the end of her life (along with the family home on the Connecticut River, to which she returned often).         In later years she expressed regret at the way she had treated her husband. In an interview that echoed what she wrote in ''Me,'' she assumed a self-chastising, no-nonsense tone and said she had been ''an absolute pig with Luddy, absolute pig.'' She continued: ''He was an angel. I thought of myself first, and that's a pig, isn't it?''         ''I would have been terrified alone in New York City,'' she said. ''We bought this house in '31, and then the minute I won the Academy Award, I got rid of Luddy.'' Many years later, not long before he died, ''I tried to make up to him for the horror I had caused him,'' she added. ''He was so generous-spirited that I don't think he considered it horror. He just considered it a kid who was wildly ambitious or something.''         Miss Hepburn is survived by a brother, Dr. Robert H. Hepburn, and a sister, Margaret H. Perry, both of Canton, Conn.; four nieces; and nine nephews.         Trousers as a Trademark         Despite her early success, reviewers in those days sometimes found her strident and mannered. In 1933 she returned to Broadway in a spectacular failure, ''The Lake,'' which inspired Dorothy Parker to write her famous aphorism, ''She ran the gamut of emotion from A to B.''         Of those early years, she said: ''I strike people as peculiar in some way, although I don't quite understand why. Of course, I have an angular face, an angular body and, I suppose, an angular personality, which jabs into people.''         Over time her screen presence softened and became more likable; meanwhile, society was catching up to her willful, independent style. She had been wearing pants, then considered quite unladylike, since the 1930's.         In her 1993 television autobiography, she recalled: ''I realized long ago that skirts are hopeless. Anytime I hear a man say he prefers a woman in a skirt, I say: 'Try one. Try a skirt.' '' Although her choice was based on comfort, her trademark trousered look became so influential that the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave her a lifetime achievement award in 1986.         Many of her early films are now regarded as classics. Playing a tough, determined actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), she read a line from a play -- ''The calla lilies are in bloom again'' -- that became the all-time favorite of Hepburn impersonators. Life magazine said that ''Stage Door'' proved that she was ''potentially, the screen's greatest actress.''         She played a free-spirited heiress in ''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938), opposite Cary Grant and a leopard. But the film, now treasured, was a box-office flop, and by then her career was in decline. In 1938 she appeared on a list of actors labeled ''box-office poison'' in a poll of movie exhibitors.         Rather than appear in a film called ''Mother Carey's Chickens,'' she bought out her contract with R.K.O. She made ''Holiday,'' another classic romantic comedy with Grant, in which she was another high-spirited socialite.         Then Miss Hepburn took charge of her career in a way few women dared in those days of the studio system. Philip Barry wrote the play ''The Philadelphia Story'' for her, modeling his heroine, Tracy Lord, on Miss Hepburn. Tracy Lord is a beautiful, high-spirited rich woman, about to marry her second husband, when her first husband and a reporter who is covering the wedding arrive to create an unexpected romantic tangle.         The play was a hit, and Miss Hepburn owned the rights to it because Howard Hughes, a sometime beau, had bought them for her. She went to Louis B. Mayer, the head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, and sold him the property on the condition that she play the lead. She chose her friend George Cukor to direct. And she asked for Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable as her co-stars. She got Cary Grant as her former husband, James Stewart as the reporter, and a hit movie. She never lost control of her career again.         Soon she went back to Mayer with another script, ''Woman of the Year,'' the story of the unlikely romance between a hotshot political columnist and a sportswriter. She asked for Tracy, whom she had never met, to play the sportswriter. This time she got him.         A Loving Partnership         The success of ''Woman of the Year'' (1942) and the stars' off-screen relationship led to other Tracy and Hepburn films that followed a similar pattern. In ''Adam's Rib'' (1949), they are married, opposing lawyers, both nicknamed Pinky. In ''Pat and Mike'' (1952), she is a champion athlete, and he is her rough-hewn manager, with whom she falls in love.         The film was devised to show off Miss Hepburn's well-cultivated athletic ability. Almost to the end of her life she played tennis and swam, and in earlier years she golfed.         It was in ''Pat and Mike'' that Tracy spoke the often-quoted line about Miss Hepburn's figure, ''Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce.' ''         Miss Hepburn often said Tracy was the best actor she had ever known and compared him in complimentary terms to a baked potato: solid, substantial stuff. ''He's meat and potatoes, meat and potatoes,'' she would say. ''I'm more like a fancy French dessert, I'm a little bit fancy, aren't I? But I wish I were meat and potatoes.'' Her other films with Tracy included the political dramas ''Keeper of the Flame'' (1942) and ''State of the Union'' (1948).         One of her most enduring films without Tracy was ''The African Queen'' (1952), in which she played the straitlaced Rosie opposite Humphrey Bogart for the director John Huston.         She wrote about it in her first book, published in 1987, whose title captures the direct, colloquial style of her writing: ''The Making of the African Queen: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind'' (Knopf).         Later she achieved one of her great artistic triumphs in an unlikely role, as the 12th-century Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968). There was still something of the typical Hepburn persona in the steely manipulation and breaking heart of the aging, dismissed queen, but none of the actress's contemporary mannerisms.         Her versatility lasted well into her career. She played the distraught, drug-addicted Mary Tyrone in the 1962 film of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' She was a fair match in toughness for John Wayne in the western ''Rooster Cogburn'' (1975). And in ''On Golden Pond'' (1981) she starred opposite Henry Fonda as a feisty older woman coping with her husband's failing memory and insisting that they should go on and live life to the fullest. In that role, the on-screen and off-screen Hepburn seemed to meld as easily as they had in her youth.         Her final screen appearance, in 1994, was a minor but tremendously emotional role in ''Love Affair.'' Playing Warren Beatty's wise old aunt, she gave advice to the woman he loved, played by Annette Bening. Miss Hepburn's age gave the role the trappings of a farewell to movies, but if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been, even venturing an unprintable line about ducks.         Throughout her career, she returned to the stage periodically. She appeared in ''The Millionairess,'' by George Bernard Shaw, on Broadway in 1952. In the late 1950's she also appeared in several Shakespeare plays in Stratford, Conn.         And in 1969, when she was 62, she made her singing debut on Broadway in the Alan Jay Lerner musical ''Coco,'' based on the life of the fashion designer Coco Chanel. She also appeared on Broadway in 1976 in ''A Matter of Gravity,'' by Enid Bagnold, and in 1981 in ''The West Side Waltz,'' by Ernest Thompson, who had written ''On Golden Pond.''         Her performances in all three of these plays were received with dazzling praise; the works themselves were treated more harshly. Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote about her performance in ''The West Side Waltz'' in terms that reflected the general critical opinion: ''One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.''         A Beloved Aunt on TV         In the 1970's she acted in television movies, including the Edwardian romantic drama ''Love Among the Ruins'' (1975), with Laurence Olivier, and ''The Corn Is Green'' (1979), both directed by Cukor. And in later years she kept busy with minor television movies.         She played a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character in ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'' (1986), ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' (1988) and ''The Man Upstairs'' (1992).         In 1994 she appeared in a few scenes in the television movie ''One Christmas,'' as yet another wise old aunt. Her tailor-made Hepburn lines included these: ''I've always lived my life exactly as I wanted. I wouldn't change a single thing. No regrets.''         As she aged, she had some physical problems from which she recovered well. She had hip-replacement surgery and operations on both her shoulders, but she remained spry. Although her head shook visibly in television interviews from the 1980's on, she vehemently denied the rumor that she had Parkinson's disease, saying she had inherited her shaking head from her grandfather Hepburn.         Her most striking television appearance was not in a dramatic role, but in a 1986 tribute to Spencer Tracy. Speaking openly about their relationship at last, she read a letter she had written to him, which she later included in her autobiography. She recalled their last years together, when he was ill and had trouble sleeping, and she would sit on the floor by his side and talk. She wondered why he drank.         ''What was it, Spense?'' she asked. It was an eloquent and sentimental performance that distilled the way her public and private lives blended.         At the conclusion of ''All About Me,'' her own television biography, she said: ''In some ways I've lived my life as a man, made my own decisions. I've been as terrified as the next person, but you've got to keep a-going; you've got to dream.'' In typical Katharine Hepburn style, she faced the camera and, at the age of 85, tacitly acknowledged how close she had to be to the end.         ''I have no fear of death,'' she said. ''Must be wonderful, like a long sleep. But let's face it: it's how you live that really counts.''         With her angular beauty and unmistakable voice, Katharine Hepburn was a distinctive presence in films and on stage, whether sparring with a modern-day suitor or trading quips in Shakespearean dress. Here are some of the plays and films in which she appeared.         Plays         The Warrior's Husband -- 1932  The Lake -- 1933  Jane Eyre -- 1937  The Philadelphia Story -- 1939  Without Love -- 1942  As You Like It -- 1950  The Millionairess -- 1952  The Merchant of Venice -- 1957  Much Ado About Nothing -- 1957  Twelfth Night -- 1960  Antony and Cleopatra -- 1960  Coco -- 1969  A Matter of Gravity -- 1976  The West Side Waltz -- 1981         Films         A Bill of Divorcement -- 1932  Christopher Strong -- 1933  Morning Glory -- 1933  Little Women -- 1933  The Little Minister -- 1934  Alice Adams -- 1935  Sylvia Scarlett -- 1936  Quality Street -- 1937  Stage Door -- 1937  Bringing Up Baby -- 1938  Holiday -- 1938  The Philadelphia Story -- 1940  Woman of the Year -- 1942  Dragon Seed -- 1944  The Sea of Grass -- 1947  State of the Union -- 1948  Adam's Rib -- 1949  The African Queen -- 1951  Pat and Mike -- 1952  Summertime -- 1955  The Rainmaker -- 1956  Desk Set -- 1957  Long Day's Journey Into Night -- 1962  Guess Who's Coming to Dinner -- 1967  The Lion in Winter -- 1968  Rooster Cogburn -- 1975  Love Among the Ruins (television) -- 1975  The Corn Is Green (television) -- 1979  On Golden Pond -- 1981  Love Affair -- 1994       
         Elizabeth Fowler, who wrote a harrowing book about being the only woman among 35 passengers on a lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for 10 days during World War II, died on May 30 at a convalescent home in West Orange, N.J. She was 95.         On an autumn evening in 1942 she was in her early thirties and had finagled passage on a cargo ship from Africa to escape a troubled marriage and join her young daughter in Connecticut. She was knitting when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship.         Ms. Fowler endured pounding rain, hunger, excruciating thirst, frigid waves and circling sharks as she and her desperate companions bobbed through an intense human drama in a very small space. The episode, as described in news reports, columns and magazine articles, sounds very much like the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie ''Lifeboat.'' But there appears to be no direct link. Ms. Fowler's book, ''Standing Room Only'' (Dodd, Mead) was published the same year the movie was released.         Lucy Greenbaum in The New York Times Book Review called Ms. Fowler's account ''a tight, terse tale of war drama where each swell of a wave is matched by the surge of a human emotion.''         The Saturday Review of Literature called the book ''almost unbearable reading at times,'' but said that its directness and vividness made it impossible to put down.         For 35 years, until recently, Ms. Fowler lived in Montclair, N.J., and her saga only gradually became known to friends she met at the local Y.M.C.A. She was a legend there for her daily exercise regimen: swimming 18 laps and doing 36 pull-ups on the diving board well into her 90's. In her 80's, she was still putt-putting around town on a motor scooter.         As Ms. Fowler intermittently spun out the story of her life, friends in the Y's steam room at first thought it implausible.         ''We all thought she was exaggerating,'' Elizabeth Crann she said. ''She was never exaggerating.''         Elizabeth Japp was born in the United States on March 13, 1908, said Ms. Crann, who interviewed her about her life. Miss Japp's father was Sir Henry Japp, a British engineer who built the rail tunnels under the East River. A profile of Sir Henry by The New York Times in 1906 called him ''the wizard.''         In her book, Ms. Fowler, who had both American and British citizenship, said the family moved back to England when she was 12. She attended English schools and then went to study music in Paris, where someone burst into one of her lessons and demanded that the master hear two children. One was the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who immediately became a pupil.         While in France, Miss Japp became engaged to an English businessman who died in a plane crash when she was 21. She returned to New York.         At some point she met Frank Fowler, a physician who worked on the Gold Coast for the Colonial Medical Service. They left their only daughter, Niccie, in England. After German bombing began, they sent her to live in Connecticut. After strains in her marriage, Ms. Fowler talked her way onto the West Kebar, a ship carrying palm oil from what is now Ghana to New York.         She was the only woman on board, and wrote that the men resented her because they believed she could not pull her weight. German submarines had been attacking many merchant ships, but Ms. Fowler on a pleasant evening was relaxing on deck, knitting. Suddenly, the captain screamed, ''This is it!''         Thirty-five people ended up in a 26-foot lifeboat, a self-contained universe of fear, boredom and oddity. Ms. Fowler wrote of trying to evade a man intent on kissing her, and how she finally managed to urinate in a bucket. Repeatedly and inexplicably, she wrote, she mourned the Burberry coat she had lost.         Mostly she told of her boat mates and their interaction. ''Human decency showed more brightly with some,'' she wrote. ''That was all -- but that was everything too.''         The lifeboat was finally spotted from land, off the coast of Barbados. After they were rescued, she worked as a nanny in Connecticut but was also something of a celebrity. Lord & Taylor displayed her bedraggled dress from the lifeboat in its window, and women's magazines profiled her. The columnist Elsa Maxwell wrote that she ''has had more emotional experiences out of this war than any other human being I know.''         Ms. Fowler, as a result, always thought she was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie, although her book was a published a month after the release of ''Lifeboat.'' John Steinbeck, who wrote the novella and the screen treatment that became ''Lifeboat,'' does not seem to have mentioned her experience.         But there is no question that her story was in the public eye, and when Ms. Fowler later met the movie's star, Tallulah Bankhead, Miss Bankhead said, ''So I was supposed to be you,'' a comment Ms. Fowler did not take as flattering.         For many years, Ms. Fowler worked as an editor for book and magazine publishers. She is survived by her daughter, Niccie Sesson of England, and a grandson, Ms. Crann said.         She treasured a piece of the lifeboat's sail her companions had given her. ''To a good shipmate,'' it said.       
         Lois Fried Rosenfield, a theatrical and film producer with her husband, Maurice, died on May 25 at her home in Glencoe, Ill. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Rosenfield and her husband backed Broadway productions like ''Barnum'' (1980), a 1983 revival of ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''Singin' in the Rain'' (1985), which they also presented in London.         Their company, Rosenfield Productions, got its start in 1973 with the film ''Bang the Drum Slowly,'' a classic baseball tale. Mrs. Rosenfield took credit for casting a virtually unknown Robert De Niro as the doomed catcher, and Mr. Rosenfield, a Chicago corporate lawyer, appeared as a team owner.         Off Broadway, in 1988, the couple helped produce a new play by Athol Fugard, ''The Road to Mecca.'' They also produced ''Falsettoland'' Off Broadway and ''Other People's Money'' in Chicago.         Lois Rosenfield grew up in Chicago, the daughter of a clothing manufacturer. She attended public schools and the University of Wisconsin. Besides her husband, she is survived by her sons, James, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Andrew, of Lake Forest, Ill.; her brothers, Howard and Donald Fried; and four grandchildren.       
         Marilyn Cole Fischbach, the founder and former sole owner of the Fischbach Gallery in Manhattan, known for showing work by young artists, died on Sunday in Paris. She was 72 and had lived mainly in Paris for two decades.         She had a long illness, said her sister, Sheila Cole.         Mrs. Fischbach founded the gallery in 1960 at 799 Madison Avenue, at 67th Street. She was its sole owner from then until the early 1980's, when she became one of four partners. She remained a partner until her death.         She had a flair for discovering and representing young artists who later became well known, including Ronald Bladen, Eva Hesse and Alex Katz.         When Mrs. Fischbach founded the gallery, she showed 1960's avant-garde art, which had not yet found an audience. When she moved the gallery to two successive locations on 57th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, she began showing art that was less avant-garde and more realistic, including works by Jane Freilicher and Nell Blaine.         Last year the gallery moved to 210 West 11th Street, at 25th Street, in Manhattan.         Marilyn Cole was born in Manhattan, where she attended the Ethical Culture School. She graduated from the Fieldston School in the Bronx, and attended New York University.         In addition to her sister, Sheila Cole of Sonoma, Calif., Mrs. Fischbach's survivors include her husband, Herbert X. Fischbach of Sonoma; sons Peter, of St. Petersburg, Fla., John, of New Orleans, and James, of Phoenix; a daughter, Sally Fischbach-Willard of Geneva, Switzerland; and grandchildren.         Correction:  June 21, 2003, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Marilyn Cole Fischbach, founder of the Fischbach Gallery in Manhattan, misstated its address. It is at 210 11th Avenue, not 210 West 11th Street.       
         Doris Bass Andrews, who with her husband, Sperry Andrews, pursued the preservation of Weir Farm, where the Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir and friends met for painting and social activity, died on May 25 in Danbury, Conn. She was 82.         The farm, in Ridgefield and Wilton, Conn., is now the Weir Farm National Historic Site, with programs for both artists and the public. The programs are run by the Weir Farm Trust, a private nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the National Park Service.         Doris Bass was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from the Erskine School in Boston. She was an Army telegraph operator during World War II and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1947, she married Mr. Andrews, a fellow student, and they became working artists who painted in watercolors.         In the late 1950's they bought the buildings that Weir owned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1982, amid plans to build housing on former Weir farmland owned by others, the Andrewses were among those campaigning to preserve the site. Sixty acres of the original farm won historic status in 1990.         The trust's programs for professional artists include a competitive artist-in-residence program and a regional visiting artist program.         Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Catherine Barrett Andrews of Madison, Ga.; two sons, Charles Sperry Andrews IV of Sedona, Ariz., and Albert Ballard Andrews of Wilton; and a brother, Bruce Bass of Louisville.       
         Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker who specialized in portraits of New York City Ballet dancers, died last Wednesday at her daughter's home in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan and Remsenberg, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Catherine Tambini, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Belle's two earliest films, ''Baymen -- Our Waters Are Dying,'' about the clam diggers of eastern Long Island, and ''Henry,'' about an independent old man living on a barge on the Hudson River, were shown on PBS. She later produced a trilogy of dance films about Suzanne Farrell, Alexandra Danilova and six ballerinas who worked with George Balanchine. The 1996 film ''Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse,'' an Academy Award nominee that she directed with Deborah Dickson, was a revealing portrait of a reticent young ballerina, Balanchine's last great inspiration, whom the choreographer loved deeply but failed to win off stage.         Ms. Belle captured all of the gaiety and pragmatism of Danilova, prima ballerina of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1938 to 1952, in her 1987 documentary ''Reflections of a Dancer: Alexandra Danilova.''         ''Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balanchine Ballerinas,'' a 1989 documentary that Ms. Belle directed with Ms. Dickson, had affectionate portrayals of the choreographer and the ballerinas Maria Tallchief, Mary Ellen Moylan, Melissa Hayden, Allegra Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler.         At her death, Ms. Belle was working on a documentary on Stanley Williams, a teacher at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, and had an option to film the book ''Passionate Nomad'' by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, a biography of the explorer Freya Stark.         Born in Chile, she grew up in Canada, Morocco and England and studied ballet in London before moving to New York City. She worked for a time in New York as a freelance writer and an editor at House & Garden magazine. She received a master of fine arts degree from the New York University Graduate Institute of Film and Television in 1968.         Ms. Belle also produced, directed and edited several short films for the Children's Television Workshop. Her films have been shown at the Sundance and New York Dance Films Festival and at festivals in Berlin, Montreal, Chicago, Leningrad, Melbourne and Sydney.         In addition to her daughter, Antonia, of Los Angeles, Ms. Belle is survived by her husband, John Belle, partner in the architectural firm of Beyer, Blinder, Belle; her brother Michael Stagg of Oakland, Calif.; her son, David, of New York City; her stepchildren, Sebastian, of Augusta, Me., Fenella of Charlottesville, Va., and Amelia, of Sonoma, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Khieu Ponnary, the quiet Cambodian intellectual who was the first wife of the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and a prominent member of the movement in its early days, died on Tuesday in Cambodia. She was 83.         A nephew, Ieng Vuth, said she died in the northwestern city of Pailin.         Despite the notoriety of her husband, Khieu Ponnary had been out of the public eye for decades. Sometime during the austere years of guerrilla war, she began suffering from mental illness. By the time the Khmer Rouge won power in 1975 and undertook the revolution that led to the deaths of 1.7 million people, she was incapacitated by her illness.         The daughter of a judge, Khieu Ponnary led a privileged life in the French colonial era. She attended the elite Lycee Sisowath in Phnom Penh where in 1940 she became the first Cambodian woman to earn a baccalaureate degree.         Intent on earning teaching credentials, she traveled to Paris with her younger sister, Khieu Thirith. There they met their future husbands, who became masterminds of the Khmer Rouge revolution.         Khieu Thirith, the outgoing if less studious sister, married Ieng Sary, who was part of the brain trust under Pol Pot, then known by his given name, Saloth Sar.         The two men were students in Paris and members of a Marxist-Leninist study circle; they spent most of their time plotting how to end French rule of their country. As they embarked on their secretive pursuit of a Communist revolution, the Cambodian radicals chose wives they could trust. By marrying sisters who shared their political goals they cemented that bond with family ties.         When they returned to Cambodia, Khieu Ponnary became a widely respected high school teacher, helping to support her husband as he began organizing for the revolution. Eventually both had to flee the capital to avoid arrest by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, then the Cambodian leader.         Ieng Sary became foreign minister of Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge victory. Khieu Thirith, then known by her married name, Ieng Thirith, became the minister of social affairs in a regime that became notorious for overworking the population, starving many to death and tearing apart families.         They became the most public members of the short-lived Communist government, while Khieu Ponnary was largely invisible, housed separately from Pol Pot and put under the care of her sister.         Once the Vietnamese overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Pol Pot separated from Khieu Ponnary and took a much younger wife, with whom he had a daughter.         He died in 1998, escaping all efforts to capture him and try him for crimes against humanity.         Despite a sojourn in China for medical treatment, Khieu Ponnary never recovered. She lived with her sister and brother-in-law in Pailin, where they were granted amnesty by the Cambodian government, after a major defection from Pol Pot and the remaining Khmer Rouge in 1996.       
         Carol Shields, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Canadian novelist who captured and illuminated the ordinariness of life -- ''domesticity, the shaggy beast that eats up 50 percent of our lives,'' as she put it -- died on Wednesday in Victoria, British Columbia. She was 68.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, which was diagnosed late in 1998.         In her 10 novels, 3 collections of stories and 3 volumes of poetry, Ms. Shields's subject was almost invariably the profundity of the mundane, the kind of subject matter that, she said, usually gets ''shoved aside by fiction writers.''         In her hands the commonplace turned into extraordinary, a skill that became evident to an audience beyond Canada with her seventh novel, ''The Stone Diaries,'' published by Random House Canada in 1993 and by Viking in the United States a year later. Narrated with humor and irony, ''The Stone Diaries'' traced the nearly nine-decade 20th-century life of Daisy Goodwill Flett, an ordinary woman but a pilgrim in search of herself. As well as a Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1995, the novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Governor General's Award for fiction, and was shortlisted for a Booker Prize. (Dual citizenship in Canada and the United States made her eligible for numerous prizes.)         Earlier Ms. Shields had built a following with her novels and stories about ordinary people in everyday situations. ''Because she's a comic writer and genuinely funny, early on she was put in the 'sweet' box, where she does not belong,'' the novelist Margaret Atwood, a friend, told an interviewer. ''The fact is, there's a dark thread in everything she writes.''         Ms. Shields once explained her writing this way: ''My novels have centered on half a dozen concerns -- the lives of women, notions of gender, the force of time, the genesis of art, synchronicity, the relationship of fiction and biography.''         Carol Ann Warner was born on June 2, 1935, in Oak Park, Ill., the third child (after fraternal twins) of Robert Elmer, a candy factory manager, and Inez (Selgren) Warner, a schoolteacher. She attended Hanover College in Indiana, and after earning a bachelor's degree in 1957 she married Donald Hugh Shields, a Canadian civil engineer. They met while she was on a study-abroad program in Britain. The couple settled in Winnipeg and had five children -- John, Anne, Catherine, Meg and Sara. Her husband, children and 11 grandchildren survive her, as well as her brother, Robert Warner, and her sister, Barbara Hipple.         Despite the demands of domesticity, Ms. Shields kept writing poems and stories in what little personal time she had. She once described herself as ''the mother who typed.'' She earned a master's degree in literature at the University of Ottawa in 1975, writing a thesis on the Canadian writer Susanna Moodie. Material that she could not work into her thesis became part of her first novel, ''Small Ceremonies'' (1976), about a woman writing a biography of Moodie. She would play such literary games throughout her career, often borrowing from other writers -- like Margaret Laurence and John Updike -- and making her derivativeness a playful theme of her fiction.         ''Small Ceremonies'' was accepted for publication just as Ms. Shields turned 40, and it began her career. At first she followed conventional naturalistic forms, in ''The Box Garden'' (1977), about the unmarried sister of the protagonist in ''Small Ceremonies''; in ''Happenstance'' (1980), a pair of complementary novellas, one narrated by a wife, the other by her husband; and in ''A Fairly Conventional Woman'' (1982), about a woman who chooses her marriage over an extramarital affair.         But she grew impatient with the classic plot of the hero or heroine facing a crisis that worsens before it can be resolved. ''I wanted wallpaper in my novels, cereal bowls, cupboards, cousins, buses, local elections, head colds, cramps, newspapers,'' she wrote in 1998, ''and I abandoned Chekhov's dictum that if there is a rifle hanging over the fireplace, it must go off before the story ends.'' She continued: ''A rifle could hang over a fireplace for countless other reasons. For atmosphere, to give texture, to comment on the owner of the house, to ignite a scene with its presence, not its ammunition.''         She began to experiment in ''Various Miracles'' (1985), a short-story collection, and continued in ''Swann'' (1987), in which the relationship of art to its audience is amusingly explored in four narrative voices and a concluding film script. ''The Republic of Love'' (1992) played with the romance-novel form -- tracing a courtship with chapters that alternate between male and female viewpoints -- and won Ms. Shields a wider international audience. Then came ''The Stone Diaries,'' followed by ''Larry's Party'' (1997), which set out to explore, as the author put it, ''what it's like to be an ordinary, middle-aged guy at the end of the century.''         The year her first novel was published she began to teach literature, first at the University of Ottawa, then, in 1978 and '79 at the University of British Columbia, and, from 1980 to 2000, at the University of Manitoba. In 1996 she became chancellor of the University of Winnipeg, and in 2000 she became its chancellor emerita.         Her cancer was diagnosed just before Christmas in 1998. After beginning chemotherapy and recovering from the shock of learning she was sick (she spent a month ''just crying on the sofa,'' she told an interviewer for The New York Times Magazine), she finished compiling another collection of short fiction, ''Dressing Up for the Carnival'' (2000), completed a brief biography of Jane Austen for the Penguin Lives Series, and set to work on a 10th novel.         In an unexpected burst of energy, she completed ''Unless,'' a feminist story about a writer whose oldest daughter, Norah, drops out of college and takes up silent begging on a sidewalk with a cardboard sign reading ''Goodness'' hanging from her neck. The novel was published in May 2002 to favorable reviews. Ms. Shields was working on another novel at the time of her death, and research for it brought her back to Chicago, her hometown.         ''I believe in goodness,'' she has said. ''I'm amazed by the amount of goodness in the world.''         She appended this view later: ''I think that evil is the occasional breakdown of goodness, a very occasional rupture,'' she told an interviewer for Maclean's magazine. ''To me, it seems astonishing that people are as good as they are. That's the surprising thing.''         She added, ''I do feel this sense of goodness is part of our human condition -- the biggest part of it.''       
         Carol Matthau, whose outspoken memoir of her life and three marriages to two famous men brought her notoriety far beyond her own wide circle of Hollywood and literary celebrities, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her son Charles Matthau, a film director.         Mrs. Matthau was the widow of the actor Walter Matthau, to whom she was married from 1959 until his death three years ago at 79. She was previously wed twice to the author and playwright William Saroyan.         With the publication of ''Among the Porcupines: A Memoir'' (Random/Turtle Bay) in 1992, the mercurial wit that was both loved and feared by friends like Maureen Stapleton, Oona O'Neill, Gloria Vanderbilt and Truman Capote became public property.         For example, when a Swedish starlet flirted with Mr. Matthau and he asked her age, Mrs. Matthau said she interjected, ''For God's sake, Walter, why don't you chop off her legs and read the rings?''         In an interview with The New York Times shortly after the book's publication, she said: ''I married Saroyan the second time because I couldn't believe how terrible it was the first time. I married Walter because I love to sleep with him.''         She was a friend of Capote for decades and laid claim in her memoir to having been his muse for Holly Golightly, the blithe spirit of his ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' She also figured in the ''Côte Basque'' section of his ''Answered Prayers'' and defended Capote long after other unwitting celebrity subjects turned against him.         Rejecting the Holly Golightly part later in life, however, she said there were only two roles she coveted: Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and Amanda Wingfield, or, as she put it: ''The lady who sells magazine subscriptions on the telephone. You know, 'The Glass Menagerie.' ''         Ms. Matthau had begun an acting career before her marriages and also published a novella about her own childhood under the pen name Carol Grace, ''The Secret in the Daisy,'' in 1955.         Carol Grace Marcus Matthau was born in Manhattan and never knew her father; she grew up in foster homes until she was 8, when her mother married Charles Marcus, an executive with the Bendix Aircraft Corporation, who adopted her.         Moving to Fifth Avenue, she went to the Dalton School, became friends with Oona O'Neill, the daughter of the Eugene O'Neill who later married Charlie Chaplin, and started meeting other people in the theater.         As told in ''Among the Porcupines,'' Saroyan, the Pulitzer Prize laureate, dated her when she was still in her teens, and they were married in 1943.         They had a son, Aram, and a daughter, Lucy, who died earlier this year. The union with Saroyan, who was well known for his difficulty, was far from happy. After the second divorce, they parted company for good. By then she had met Walter Matthau and studied Method acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.         She understudied Jayne Mansfield in ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' and married Matthau in August 1959. After that, she listed herself as a homemaker and freelance writer.         Mrs. Matthau is survived by her two sons, Charles, known professionally also as Charlie Matthau, of Manhattan, and Aram Saroyan of Los Angeles; a sister, Elinor Pruder of Brooklyn; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  July 26, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on Thursday about Carol Matthau, who wrote of her life among Hollywood and literary celebrities, misstated the residence of her surviving sister, Elinor Dee Pruder. It is Southampton, N.Y., not Brooklyn.       
         Gertrude Samuels, a writer and photographer whose 50-year career took her from the displaced-persons camps of postwar Europe to the blight of drug addiction in America's cities, died Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side. She was 93.         Beginning in the wartime 1940's, she worked as a writer, photographer and editor on the staff of The New York Times Magazine. In 1975, she turned to freelance writing.         Before and after, her byline appeared in many publications, to which she contributed picture essays. She remained a United Nations correspondent for The New Leader magazine until a few years ago.         As a writer, she was at home in genres beyond topical journalism. She produced books for young readers, stage plays and a biography of David Ben-Gurion, along with other writings on Israel.         Miss Samuels was an early practitioner of photojournalism as documentary. She covered national and foreign affairs for The New York Post, Newsweek and Time magazine before she joined the staff of The Times in 1943.         Her pictorial articles also appeared in magazines like National Geographic, Redbook and The Saturday Evening Post. Her reports were broadcast overseas by the United States Information Service.         Gertrude Samuels was born in Manchester, England, and came with her family to Chicago when she was 14. She attended Busch Conservatory of Music there and George Washington University but dropped out to join the staff of The New York Post in 1937.         She returned to the classroom years later, after leaving The Times. She received a B.A. in English literature at N.Y.U. in 1982; she earned a master's degree one year later.         At The Times, in 1943, she wrote news summaries for the Week in Review before The Times Magazine assigned her to cover events nationally and abroad.         She toured displaced-persons camps in Europe, traveled the Middle East reporting on the birth of Israel and the refugees in the region, and, in the early 1950's, contributed magazine articles from Southeast Asia, North Africa and Korea. On the home front, she told readers about the racial unrest attending school desegregation in the South, juvenile delinquency in the inner cities and drug addiction.         Her work was recognized with photography awards and a 1955 George Polk Award, among others.         ''B-G: Fighter of Goliaths; The Story of David Ben-Gurion'' (Crowell, 1961; rev. ed. 1974) included her own photographs from Israel, as did ''The Secret of Gonen: Portrait of a Kibbutz on the Border in a Time of War'' (Avon, 1969).         Her other books included ''The People vs. Baby: A Documentary Novel'' (Doubleday, 1967); ''Run, Shelley, Run!'' (Crowell, 1974); ''Mottele: A Partisan Odyssey'' (Harper, 1976); ''Adam's Daughter'' (Crowell, 1977); ''Of David and Eva: A Love Story'' (New American Library, 1978); and ''Yours, Brett'' (Lodestar, 1988).         Among her plays were ''The Plant That Talked Back'' and ''Judah the Maccabee and Me,'' both produced at the Lambs Club Theater in 1970.         Miss Samuels is survived by her son, Paul Oppenheimer of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Gertrude Samuels is among those featured at an exhibition in the Mugar Library of Boston University in Boston, ''On the Front Line: Women Journalists on War and Politics,'' which opened in January.       
         Jane Barbe, who was known to millions, though not by name or appearance, as the voice of telephone-company recordings and voice-mail systems across America, died on July 18 in Roswell, Ga. She was 74.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her husband, John.         Ms. Barbe began her career of delivering impersonal messages in friendly, helpful tones in 1963. Working for Electronic Communications Inc. in Atlanta, she recorded the time and temperature information provided by phone companies, then tackled the ''intercept'' messages -- like ''The number you have dialed is not in service'' -- that greet misdialers and the misinformed.         She also recorded daily horoscopes as well as a short-lived series of seasonal messages from Mrs. Claus, which was discontinued after out-of-state parents complained about the long-distance charges run up by their children.         In the early 1980's, Ms. Barbe was chosen by Octel Communications, now part of Avaya, to record messages for its nascent voice-mail technology. Her voice is now heard at thousands of companies, helping employees to administer personal greetings and outside callers to find their way out of ''voice-mail jail.''         Ms. Barbe's talent involved more than a pleasant phone manner. She had the ability to give readings of precise lengths, often measured in tenths of seconds, which are required in a medium in which messages are often assembled from dozens of individual sound bites.         She was also adept at vocal characterizations. She recorded messages for an Australian phone company in an Australian accent and provided the voice of Margaret Mitchell for the 1988 film '' 'Gone With the Wind': The Making of a Legend.'' The soft Southern accent came naturally to her; she usually suppressed it in the recording studio.         Born Jane Schneider on July 28, 1928, in Florida, she moved with her family to Atlanta as a small child. She studied drama at the University of Georgia.         She is survived by her husband, John, a composer who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Susan Stubin of Passaic, N.J.; a son, David, of Athens, Ga., and seven grandchildren.         In contrast to her sometimes long-winded messages for voice-mail systems, her own home answering machine's message was refreshingly direct and to the point. ''I keep it as simple as possible,'' she explained in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''I have a friend whose machine says, 'At the beep, speak.' I like that.''       
         Frances Stevens Reese, a founder and chairwoman emeritus of the environmental group Scenic Hudson and a veteran of the fight to keep a power plant from being built on Storm King Mountain, died last Wednesday in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 85 and lived in Hughsonville, a village in Dutchess County, N.Y.         She was fatally injured in a car accident on Wednesday on Route 9 near Cold Spring when her driver lost control of the car and struck a utility pole, according to the Putnam County sheriff's office. The driver, Pedro S. Arce, 48, of Hughsonville, survived with lesser injuries.         To members of her organization and to many Hudson River preservationists, she was known as the grande dame of the Hudson Valley.         Franny Reese, as she was known, was a spark plug in a movement that began 40 years ago with a handful of local gentry who sought to check the unbridled development of the Hudson River Valley.         Their immediate cause was to forestall a projected dig for the world's largest hydroelectric power plant, which would have forever changed the dramatic face of Storm King Mountain, looming above the Hudson in Orange County. Her little band won legal standing in 1965 to take on the Federal Power Commission and the developer, Consolidated Edison.         The movement became today's Scenic Hudson, a potent force in the national environmental movement. It was the group's victory in the Storm King case that established the principle that citizens could intervene in court cases affecting the environment even if those individuals were not in danger of sustaining damages to their properties.         The Storm King fight was the first in which a group of such citizens was granted court access in a site-licensing decision. Language derived from that precedent was incorporated into the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which established the Environmental Protection Agency and mandated environmental impact studies for such construction projects. Scenic Hudson helped secure passage of other important legislation, like the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the 1980 Superfund Law.         Mrs. Reese remained a mainstay of Scenic Hudson as it helped create dozens of riverfront parks and preserves from Manhattan north to the foothills of the Adirondacks.         As chairwoman from 1966 to 1984, she also oversaw the group's legal and educational work. She attended board meetings until her death and remained cheerfully active as a strategist for policy and litigation, a liaison to state and federal governments and one of the organization's leading fund-raisers.         Frances Stevens was born in Manhattan. She attended Barnard College, majoring in playwriting and English, and Yale Art School. In 1937, she married Willis Livingston Meier Reese, who shared her interests in conservation and historical preservation in the Hudson Valley.         Mrs. Reese was a longtime trustee and benefactor of Marist College.         Her husband, who was a Charles Evans Hughes Professor of Law at Columbia, died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Frances R. Olivieri of Manhattan; three sons, John R., of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., George B., of Manhattan, and Alexander S., of Hughsonville; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Kathleen Raine, a mystically inclined British poet and a scholar of Yeats and Blake, died on Sunday in London. She was 95.         Less known in the United States than in Europe, where she was regarded as a grande dame of European letters, she published several books of poetry in America in addition to her scholarly works.         Starting in 1943, she published a considerable oeuvre of her own even as she became a celebrated interpreter of the mystical poet William Blake to the English-speaking world.         She was inspired at a very young age by the visionary elements of English romance literature, and her poetic work has a spiritual streak seeking to fuse reason and the ethereal, the knowable and faith. Her tastes were eclectic, including Jungian psychology and neo-Platonism.         She preferred to think, citing W. B.Yeats, that ''poetry and religion are the same thing.'' Over the years she attracted many admirers, including the Prince of Wales, who in 1990 gave his patronage to a ''school of wisdom'' that she founded, the Temenos Academy of Integral Studies.         Temenos, a teaching institution, preached a universalist theme, braiding the mystical strains of Buddhism and Hinduism with Judaism, Christianity and Islam, a considerable departure from her strict Methodist early upbringing. In 1999 she began the Temenos Academy Review, which publishes selected lectures along with articles and poetry.         Britain's Royal Society of Literature in 1991 named her one of the 10 greatest living writers. She received the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 1992 and was honored as a Commander of the British Empire three years ago.         By then her reputation was firmly established well beyond Britain. Translations of her books on Yeats and Blake were read from Sweden to Spain. Her first volume of autobiography, ''Farewell Happy Fields,'' was published in 1973. In France the last two parts of her three-part autobiography, ''The Land Unknown'' (1975), and ''The Lion's Mouth'' (1977), sold briskly as ''Le Royaume Inconnu'' (1978), and ''La Gueule du Lion'' (1987), and she became a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2000.         Kathleen Jessie Raine was born in Ilford, Essex. She studied natural sciences and psychology at Girton College, Cambridge, and graduated in 1929.         While many of her contemporaries drifted to the political left, she explored the mystique of Celtic history, magic and astronomy. She spent the war years in and out of London in various jobs.         She made her debut with ''Stone and Flower: Poems'' in 1943, followed by ''Living in Time.'' Her first book to appear in the United States was ''The Pythoness and Other Poems'' in 1952.         In 1956 she received an appointment as a fellow at Girton, where she taught and pursued her scholarly work.         She was briefly married to Hugh Sykes Davies, a critic and Cambridge don, who died in 1984. Her second marriage to Charles Madge, a poet and sociologist, also ended in divorce; he died in 1996. She is survived by a daughter, Anna Hopwell Madge; a son, James Madge; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Kathleen Raine's works currently listed in Books in Print are ''Blake and Antiquity'' (Routledge; 2d ed., 2002); ''Collected Poems'' (Basic, 2001); ''India Seen Afar'' (Braziller, 1991); ''Inner Journey of the Poet'' (Braziller, 1982); ''Defending Ancient Springs'' (Anthropomorphic; repr., ed., 1985); ''Golgonooza -- City of Imagination: Last Studies of William Blake'' (Anthropomorphic, 1991); ''Presence: Poems 1984-1987'' (Anthropomorphic, 1987); ''Selected Poems'' (Anthropomorphic, 1988); and ''William Blake'' (Thames Hudson, 1985).       
         Laura Rapaport Borsten, who was in the first group of 40 recruits accepted to be a Wave, a member of the women's Navy corps, died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91.         Her husband, Orin, said Mrs. Borsten, who lived in Los Angeles, kept up with other veterans and believed she was the last surviving member of the first group, made up of officer trainees.         Lt. Billy Ray Davis, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that Mrs. Borsten, then Laura Rapaport, joined as one of the first 40 Waves on Aug. 28, 1942. She rose to the rank of lieutenant commander.         President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the law creating the Women's Reserve of the Navy on July 30, 1942. The corps was soon christened Waves, for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Capt. Mildred McAfee, first director of the corps, suggested that it really meant ''Women Are Very Essential Sometimes.''         Organized to allow more men to be available for combat, women soon filled jobs like repairing aircraft, breaking enemy codes and serving as gunnery instructors. Many did clerical work.         Before the Waves, neither the women who served in World War I nor Navy nurses were permitted to become officers. Mrs. Borsten and her fellow officer trainees were greeted by newsreel cameras and autograph hunters when they reported for training at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.         By the end of the war, there were 8,000 Wave officers and 76,000 enlisted Waves. Though the name Wave was dropped in 1972, Navy women have gone on to command battleships and fighter squadrons, and rise to the rank of three-star admiral.         But they presented challenges to military tradition. For example, Miss McAfee decreed that Waves would be allowed to wear enough makeup ''to look human.''         Laura Golde Rapaport was born on a farm in McIntosh County, N.D., on Feb. 29, 1912.         She graduated from the University of Minnesota with honors in library science. Just as she was starting a job in adult education, Leo W. Schwarz, an author and lecturer on Jewish concerns, met her in Minneapolis. He asked her if she wanted a job in New York City.         She became director of international relations and social relations for the National Council of Jewish Women, and, among other things, helped bring Jews out of Hitler's Germany. In 1938, she testified a Senate committee against the equal-rights amendment, saying that it might jeopardize the gains women had made in areas like widows' pensions.         In 1942, she received a call from Elizabeth Reynard, a Barnard professor who was to become assistant director of the Waves. Professor Reynard said that Miss McAfee, who was to become Waves director, wondered if she was interested in joining.         Like most of the original 40 officer candidates, all of whom had distinguished themselves professionally, Miss Rapaport had no idea why she was asked.         After training at Smith, Miss Rapaport was selected to teach the 750 women arriving for officers' training. She was then assigned to teach officers and enlisted Waves at U.S.S. Hunter, the name the Navy had given Hunter College in the Bronx. She succeeded in her quiet campaign to recruit black officers, and helped forestall a proposal for segregated platoons.         Her last assignment was in Hawaii, the first posting of Waves outside the continental United States. As a transportation officer there, she learned to drive.         After her discharge, she visited her sister in Los Angeles. On a street corner, she saw Mr. Borsten, whom she had dated before the war. They were married a few months later.         In addition to him, Mrs. Borsten is survived by a son, Joseph Borsten of Los Angeles; a daughter, Joan Borsten Vidov of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Minkowski of Santa Cruz; and a grandson.       
         Gisele MacKenzie, the Canadian singing star of the 1950's television show ''Your Hit Parade,'' died on Friday in Burbank, Calif. She was 76.         The cause was colon cancer, said her daughter, Gigi Downs.         Although she was known mainly for her contralto voice, Ms. MacKenzie also traded barbs and violin riffs with Jack Benny and played the piano on her own variety show. On ''Your Hit Parade,'' she sang the most popular tunes of the week with her fellow cast members Snooky Lanson, Dorothy Collins and Russell Arms.         Gisele Marie Louise Marguerite La Fleche was born on Jan. 10, 1927, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her father, a doctor who played the violin, and her mother, who sang and played the organ, encouraged her musical talent. She studied violin in her teens at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, but she began singing and playing popular songs on the piano after school. At a party where she sang for wartime sailors, she met Robert Shuttleworth, a military bandleader, who later hired her to perform with his hotel orchestra.         He became her business manager, and in 1958, her husband.         Ms. MacKenzie wavered between a career as a singer or one as a concert violinist until her $3,000 violin was stolen from a parked car. Her vocation thus resolved, she began singing on a Canadian radio show called ''Meet Gisele'' in 1946, her popularity earning her the informal title of Canada's first lady of song.         In 1951, when she began to sing in the United States, she took her father's middle name, MacKenzie, as her last name. In an interview with The New York Journal in 1956, she said she worried that the name Gisele La Fleche ''sounded like a strip tease artist's.''         She sang for two years on Bob Crosby's radio show ''Club 15,'' and when it went off the air, she joined Jack Benny on tour. The attention she gained with Mr. Benny won her a spot on ''Your Hit Parade,'' replacing June Valli.         She appeared on the show from 1953 to 1957, then left to star in her own variety series, ''The Gisele MacKenzie Show,'' which lasted only six months. In 1963 she was on weekly television again, becoming a regular on ''The Sid Caesar Show.'' Over the next four decades, she starred in regional theater and made guest appearances on television game shows and series like ''MacGyver'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.''         Her two marriages, to Mr. Shuttleworth and to Robert Klein, a businessman, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Downs, of Newport Beach, Calif., she is survived by a son, Mac Shuttleworth; a brother, George La Fleche; a sister, Janine Helzer; and two grandchildren.       
         Marie Foster, a dental technician whose quiet but effective efforts to win voting rights for blacks made her a national symbol when she was beaten by the police in the Selma, Ala., voting rights march in 1965, died on Saturday in Selma. She was 85.         She was one of the original eight members of the Dallas County Voters League, a group that came to be called the Courageous Eight and worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to make Selma the center of a national crusade. She was later called ''the mother of the voting rights movement'' by its local organizers.         She tried eight times to register to vote before succeeding; she had already started coaching blacks on how to pass the deliberately bewildering voter registration tests.         She was clubbed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge when state troopers stopped the first march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7. Two days later, she tried to hobble forward in another march, one that was stopped peacefully.         On March 11, when President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to announce that he would send Congress a strong voting rights bill, it was in Mrs. Foster's living room that Dr. King watched and wept at the news.         When the march was finally permitted to begin on March 21, two weeks later, Mrs. Foster walked 50 miles in five days with injured knees.         In his book on the civil rights movement, ''The Children'' (Random House, 1998), David Halberstam called Mrs. Foster ''one of the heroes of the Selma group.''         Marie Priscilla Martin was born on Oct. 24, 1917, in rural Wilcox County, near Alberta, Ala. Her mother wanted her children to be educated, but her father resisted moving to town, Mrs. Foster said in a statement prepared for the Web site of the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, which she helped found. Her mother then sneaked away and took her children to Selma.         Mrs. Foster dropped out of high school to marry and had three young children when her husband died. After working for years, she returned to high school and graduated after her daughter, Rose. She then went to junior college, became a dental hygienist and went to work for her brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson.         She became involved in the growing voting rights movement because of anger over racial discrimination. Mr. Halberstam suggested that being employed by her brother protected her from economic pressure from the white establishment.         Working with the Dallas County Voters League, she went door to door with leaflets and asked all ministers in town to announce the registration effort from their pulpits.         Things at first went slowly. Taylor Branch, in his book ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998), said her first nighttime class to teach literacy for the voting test drew one student, a man in his 70's.         In 1964, she was named in an injunction against voter registration leaders along with John Lewis, the civil rights leader who is now a Georgia congressman, Mr. Branch wrote. The Ku Klux Klan threatened her life several times.         In 1985, Mrs. Foster told about her experience at the bridge in an interview with United Press International.         ''It was a trooper who hit me,'' she said, adding that it happened just as she crossed the bridge near the head of the column of about 525 demonstrators. ''I lay on the pavement with my eyes closed. I didn't move. I stood my ground.''         Mrs. Foster is survived by her son, James Foster of Indianapolis; her daughter, Rose Davis of Salt Lake City; her brothers, Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Thomas Martin, both of Selma; and three grandchildren.         Her activism never stopped, said Rose Sanders, a friend and civil rights lawyer. Among more recent battles, Mrs. Foster was a leader in successful fights for public housing for poor people in Selma and the removal of a statue of the founder of the Klan from a public park.         She conducted reading classes for underprivileged children in a small classroom next to her home, and made it a point to take poor children to Sunday school.         ''She never quit,'' Ms. Sanders said.       
         Norma Storch, a white woman whose decision to have her 4-year-old mixed-race daughter raised by a black couple became the subject of an Emmy Award-winning documentary made by the daughter in adulthood, died on Aug. 28 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, said the daughter, June Cross, the producer of the documentary, ''Secret Daughter,'' which PBS broadcast in 1996.         The film was heralded as a searing look at race relations in the 1950's and 60's, and drew praise for its emotional rawness and the bravery of both mother and daughter. Other reviews suggested that the documentary's power came from a mother's willingness to reject her daughter and then rationalize it.         Ms. Cross said in an interview last week that this impression properly reflected the documentary but not their real relationship. She said that tensions were exaggerated for dramatic effect.         But for almost 35 years, Mrs. Storch and her husband -- the actor and comedian Larry Storch, who starred as Cpl. Randolph Agarn in the 1960's comedy series ''F Troop,''-- indisputably lived a lie. They told friends and acquaintances that the black girl who visited them at their Hollywood home was their adopted daughter, who lived with a black family for most of the year.         The truth was that Ms. Cross was the child of an affair Mrs. Storch had had with Jimmy Cross, a black song-and-dance man who was Stump in the well-known performing team Stump and Stumpy.         Mrs. Storch fled Mr. Cross soon after their daughter's birth in 1954, because of his drinking, drug use and violence toward her, she said. As June matured and her complexion darkened, she and her mother encountered racist reactions, including a petition from residents of their Manhattan building demanding that they leave.         Mrs. Storch asked two friends, a middle-class black couple in Atlantic City, to raise June. After they took her in, Mrs. Storch cried every night, developed shingles and wrote daily letters to the girl, according to the documentary.         Norma Greve was born on April 6, 1922, in Pocatello, Idaho. Her mother moved from place to place, married seven times or so, and from time to time vanished completely. From the time Mrs. Storch was 9 until her marriage, she used the last name Booth, the name of one of her stepfathers.         Shortly after graduation from high school in Long Beach, Calif., Norma Greve married Jack May, a competitive surfer, with whom she had a son, Lary. After their divorce in 1945, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, and became a member of the Circle Repertory Theater.         In 1947, she had a brief romance with Larry Storch, and gave birth in 1948 to a daughter, Candace, whom they put up for adoption. Ms. Cross said that Candace and the Storches were reunited after Candace read an article about the documentary in People magazine.         Mrs. Storch had placed Lary with various caretakers as she pursued her acting career. He is now a professor at the University of Minnesota and helped persuade his mother to participate in the documentary.         In addition to June Cross and Lary May, Mrs. Storch is survived by her husband, who lives in Manhattan; her daughter Candace Herman of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Storch was working as a hatcheck girl in Manhattan in 1959 when she renewed her relationship with Mr. Storch. They were married in 1961, and two years later moved to Hollywood, where she managed his career.         June Cross spent many summers with them. For the couple's conservative friends, they concocted an elaborate story about having adopted June, who they said was the abused child of former neighbors. They said they had sent the girl to live with black friends of theirs, which was true.         ''In those days, people were encrusted in prejudice,'' Mr. Storch said in an interview with People magazine in 1996. ''We saw no reason to rock the boat.''         Neither did Ms. Cross, even after graduating from Harvard and making a successful career as a television producer, with PBS's MacNeil-Lehrer Report, then at CBS News and later with ''Frontline'' on PBS.         She had one reunion with her father, months before he died of cancer in 1981. She told People magazine that she felt only ''detached curiosity.''         But Ms. Cross said she came to appreciate the decision her mother had made when she was a little girl. In one scene in the documentary, she laughs nervously when her mother says she would have aborted her if she had had enough money.         At another point in the film, she says, ''I think the truth of it is that she loved me enough to give me away.''       
         Margaret E. Murie, a conservationist and an author who helped preserve millions of acres of unspoiled land in Alaska and across the United States by encouraging the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the passage of the Wilderness Act, died on Sunday at her ranch in Moose, Wyo. She was 101.         A longtime official of the Wilderness Society, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Bill Clinton in 1998.         Ms. Murie, who was known as Mardy, grew up in a log cabin in Alaska, an experience that she wrote about in her autobiography, ''Two in the Far North.''         Published in 1962 and still in print, the book describes the winter night when she was 14 and Fairbanks caught fire, prompting her father and other men to burn the town's bacon supply as fuel to keep the steam-powered water pump running; her late-winter dogsled trips over thawing rivers; how in 1924 she became the first woman to graduate from the University of Alaska; and her marriage later that year, in a 3 a.m. sunrise ceremony, to Olaus Murie, a biologist for the Biological Survey, the forerunner of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.         ''Two in the Far North'' also recounts the couple's honeymoon, a 500-mile caribou research expedition by dogsled, as well as a later river journey taken with their infant son, Martin, strapped to their canoe.         Although Ms. Murie (pronounced MYUR-ee) and her husband moved to Wyoming in the 1930's to study elk migrations, they never lost their focus on Alaska and returned there often.         After traveling in the Brooks Range above the Arctic Circle in the summer of 1956, they began a campaign to set aside parts of the area as a wildlife refuge.         Four years later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower designated eight million acres as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; President Jimmy Carter more than doubled the protected area in 1980.         The Muries extended their preservation campaign in the early 1960's by lobbying Congress in behalf of the Wilderness Act, legislation intended to prevent development on designated lands nationwide. Ms. Murie continued her support after her husband's death in 1963. She was invited to the White House by President Lyndon B. Johnson to attend the signing of the act.         Ms. Murie received numerous other honors for her support of conservation and the protection of the environment, including the 1980 Audubon Medal and the 1983 John Muir Award from the Sierra Club.         Born Margaret Elizabeth Thomas on Aug. 18, 1902, in Seattle, she moved to Alaska with her family when she was 9.         In addition to her autobiography, she wrote two other books, ''Island Between,'' published in 1977, and ''Wapiti Wilderness,'' published in 1966 with her husband as co-author.         Their Wyoming home, the Murie Ranch, was declared a National Historic District in 1997 and today is the headquarters of the Murie Center, an educational center dedicated to conservation.         Ms. Murie is survived by her sister Louise Murie-MacLeod of Jackson, Wyo., who was the wife of Olaus's brother Adolph, who was a National Park Service biologist and an author; two sons, Martin, of North Bangor, N.Y., and Donald, of Palm Springs, Calif.; a daughter, Joanne Miller of Brookline, Mass.; 9 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a pivotal figure in one of the 20th century's great epics -- the struggle for control of post-imperial China waged between the Nationalists and the Communists during the Japanese invasion and the violent aftermath of World War II -- died on Thursday in Manhattan, the Foreign Ministry of Taiwan reported yesterday. She was 105.         Madame Chiang, a dazzling and imperious politician, wielded immense influence in Nationalist China, but she and her husband were eventually forced by the Communist victory into exile in Taiwan, where she presided as the grande dame of Nationalist politics for many years. After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, she retreated to New York City, where she spent the rest of her life.         But her old influence overseas was matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the relentless and sophisticated lobbying effort she and her husband set up in Washington, through which they distributed uncounted millions through law firms and public relations companies to promote Taiwan's cause and maintain recognition by the American government.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband blamed the United States for the Nationalists' loss of China, and continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland. Although that hope eventually faded, American support for Taiwan remained strong for years, delaying Washington's recognition of Beijing as the capital of China until 1979, three decades after the Communists seized power.         As a fluent English speaker, as a Christian, as a model of what many Americans hoped China to become, Madame Chiang struck a chord with American audiences as she traveled across the country, starting in the 1930's, raising money and lobbying for support of her husband's government. She seemed to many Americans to be the very symbol of the modern, educated, pro-American China they yearned to see emerge -- even as many Chinese dismissed her as a corrupt, power-hungry symbol of the past they wanted to escape.         Ultimately, that difference in perspectives was perhaps one reason that she fled an increasingly democratic Taiwan, where many people reviled her and where she felt less at home as native Taiwanese eclipsed the exiled mainlanders.         Madame Chiang was the most famous member of one of modern China's most remarkable families, the Soongs, who dominated Chinese politics and finance in the first half of the 20th century. Yet in China it was her American background and style that distinguished Soong Mei-ling; that was her maiden name, sometimes spelled May-ling.         For many Americans, her finest moment came in 1943, when she barnstormed the United States in search of support for the Nationalist cause against Japan, winning donations from countless Americans who were mesmerized by her passion, determination and striking good looks. Her address to a joint meeting of Congress electrified Washington, winning billions of dollars in aid.         She helped create American policy toward China during the war years, running the Nationalist government's propaganda operation and emerging as its most important diplomat. Yet she was also deeply involved in the endless maneuverings of her husband, who was uneasily at the helm of several shifting alliances with Chinese warlords vying for control of what was then a badly fractured nation.         A devout Christian, Madame Chiang spoke fluent English tinted with the Southern accent she acquired as a schoolgirl in Georgia, and she presented a civilized and humane image of a courageous China battling Japanese invasion and Communist subversion. Yet historians have documented the murderous path that Chiang Kai-shek led in his efforts to win, then keep, and ultimately lose power. It also became clear in later years that the Chiang family had pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid intended for the war.         Madame Chiang had a notoriously tempestuous relationship with her husband, and then with his son by a previous marriage, Chiang Ching-kuo, who became Taiwan's leader after Chiang Kai-shek's death. She had no children.         Her skill as a politician, alternately charming and vicious, made her a formidable presence. She made a play for Taiwan's leadership after Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, even though she was 90 and living in New York.         Although she suffered numerous ailments, including breast cancer, she outlived all her contemporary rivals. She was said to credit her religious faith -- she told friends she rose at dawn for an hour of prayer each day -- for her good health.         Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, who worked closely with her when he commanded American forces in China during the war, described Madame Chiang in his diary as a ''clever, brainy woman.''         ''Direct, forceful, energetic,'' he wrote. ''Loves power, eats up publicity and flattery, pretty weak on her history. Can turn on charm at will and knows it.''         Soong Mei-ling's rise to power began when she married Chiang in an opulent ceremony in Shanghai in 1927, bringing together China's star military man with one of the nation's most illustrious families.         Her eldest sister, Soong Ai-ling, directed the family's affairs and innumerable money-making ventures with the help of her husband, H. H. Kung, a scion of one of China's wealthiest banking families.         Madame Chiang's second sister, Soong Qing-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China's first president after the last emperor was toppled in 1911. After Sun's death, Soong Qing-ling carried his banner over into the Communist camp, causing an irreparable rupture in the family.         When the vanquished Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Soong Qing-ling stayed behind. The Communist Party leadership called her the only true patriot in the Soong family, and appointed her honorary chairman of the People's Republic in 1980, a year before her death.         A Telling Ditty         Today, Chinese still remember the three sisters with a telling ditty: ''One loved money, one loved power, one loved China,'' referring respectively to Ai-ling, Mei-ling and Qing-ling.         Madame Chiang's elder brother, T. V. Soong, often called Nationalist China's financial wizard, served at various times as finance minister, acting prime minister and foreign minister, where his primary role was raising money from America.         Although Madame Chiang developed a stellar image with the American public, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other leaders became disillusioned with her and her husband's despotic and corrupt practices. Eleanor Roosevelt was shocked at her answer when asked at a dinner at the White House how the Chinese government would handle a strike by coal miners. Madame Chiang silently drew a sharp fingernail across her neck.         ''She can talk beautifully about democracy,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said later. ''But she does not know how to live democracy.''         By the end of the war, the loyalty of Nationalist officials melted away as the government grew corrupt and fiscally traitorous, printing money so aggressively that the Chinese currency fell to an exchange rate of several million yuan to the dollar. Many Nationalist soldiers were reduced to begging for food because they went unpaid, yet American diplomats discovered that military supplies sent from the United States to China sometimes appeared on the black market soon after arrival.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland, although That hope eventually faded.         In New York, Madame Chiang lived in an apartment on Gracie Square in Manhattan. In March 1999, as she turned 101, hard of hearing but still quick-witted, she told visitors that she read the Bible and The New York Times every day.         The Soong family's saga, cutting across many strands of modern Chinese history, began when Madame Chiang's father, Charlie Soong, sailed to the United States at the age of 12. Coming from a family of traders in Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Mr. Soong was taken in by Methodists in North Carolina who converted him to Christianity in hopes of sending him back to spread the word of Jesus in China.         After returning to Shanghai in 1886, Mr. Soong, a genial wheeler-dealer, passed up missionary life to start a business printing Bibles, earning a fortune. He also printed political pamphlets secretly for Sun Yat-sen, then working to overthrow China's last emperor. On Jan. 1, 1912, Sun became China's first president.         Sun lasted in office only a few months before his coalition disintegrated, and after he fled to Japan, he hired Mr. Soong's second daughter, Soong Qing-ling, as a secretary. They soon married, despite the age difference: he was 50 and she was 21.         Educated in America         Mei-ling Soong was born in Shanghai on March 5, 1898, although some references give 1897 as the year because Chinese usually consider everyone to be one year old at birth. At the age of 10, she had followed her elder sisters to the Wesleyan College for Women in Macon, Ga.         She entered Wellesley College near Boston in 1913; her brother, T. V., was enrolled at Harvard. She majored in English literature, and was remembered by her classmates as a chubby, vivacious and determined student. She graduated in 1917 and returned to Shanghai speaking English better than Chinese.         She was introduced to her future husband in 1922. By that time, she had matured into a slender beauty and taken to wearing full-length, body-hugging gowns.         Chiang Kai-shek, a severe-looking military aide to Sun who established a school for officers in southern China, may have been as attracted to the Soongs' financial and political connections as he was to their youngest daughter. His initial overtures to her were rebuffed, and after Sun's death in 1925, as Chiang took the title generalissimo and tried to succeed him as the leader of the Nationalist cause, he proposed to Sun's young widow, Soong Qing-ling. She said no.         Chiang allied himself with warlords in southern and central China and with the Soviet Union, where Stalin regarded the Nationalists as more progressive than the warlords who still controlled Beijing and northern China. Communist rebels, not yet led by Mao Zedong, felt they deserved Moscow's support. But Stalin insisted on supporting the Nationalists.         In 1927, Chiang shocked his Soviet backers by carrying out a massacre of leftists in Shanghai. Edgar Snow, the American journalist, estimated that Chiang's forces had executed more than 5,000 people.         The massacre caused a permanent rent in the Soong family. Soong Qing-ling, as Sun's widow, led a faction of Nationalists who voted to expel Chiang from all his posts. T. V. Soong resigned as finance minister, though he was later persuaded to resume his alliance with Chiang.         When Chiang renewed his interest in Soong Mei-ling in 1927, she told him that she would consent to marry only if he could win the approval of her mother, who had reservations about a man who was neither Christian nor single. Chiang had already fathered a son in a marriage that was arranged when he was only 14, and had adopted a second son and married a second wife, Chen Chieh-ru. Chiang promised to convert, and eventually sent Chen away to the United States, where she enrolled at Columbia University and earned a doctorate.         The Chiang-Soong wedding took place in Shanghai on Dec. 1, 1927. A small Christian ceremony was held at the Soong mansion on Seymour Road, followed by a political ceremony at the Majestic Hotel, beneath a portrait of Sun.         As a political partner to her husband, Madame Chiang developed what she called the New Life Movement, a series of principles for modernizing China through social discipline, courtesy and service. She engineered public hygiene campaigns and denounced traditional superstitions.         While many ordinary Chinese resisted it, the campaign was popular with foreigners, particularly with Henry Luce, the publisher of Time magazine, who was born to missionaries in China. A longtime supporter of the Chiangs, Luce named the couple ''Man and Woman of the Year'' in 1938.         During the war with the Japanese, Madame Chiang pushed her husband to build up the Nationalist air force, and helped hire Claire Chennault, who commanded a mercenary force of pilots that came to be known as the Flying Tigers.         During World War II, the relationship between General Stilwell, Chiang and Madame Chiang proved contentious. The general accused Chiang of hoarding resources, deliberately avoiding battle with the Japanese to spare his men to fight the Communists.         Madame Chiang was in the middle, sometimes interceding on General Stilwell's behalf when resisting him threatened American support. But she also plotted against the general, telling journalists that he was incompetent. She and her husband lobbied Washington to have him replaced, and he was, in 1944.         After Japan was defeated in 1945 and the civil war between Nationalists and Communists accelerated, the Communists swiftly expanded their control into the northeast.         The governing Nationalists received considerable American aid, but American officials in China warned of vast amounts of graft among Nationalists. More than $3 billion was appropriated to China during the war, and most of it was transmitted through T. V. Soong, who as China's foreign minister was based in Washington. It later became apparent that the Soong family suffered vicious infighting over the purloined funds.         Madame Chiang traveled to Washington again in November 1948 to plead for emergency aid for the war against the Communists. Yet Congress had recently assigned $1 billion more to China, and President Truman was impatient with the Chiangs and what had become an apparently hopeless effort to shore up the Nationalist government. Madame Chiang never returned to China.         ''I can ask the American people for nothing more,'' she said. ''It is either in your hearts to love us, or your hearts have been turned from us.''         In her frustration, she publicly likened American politics to ''clodhopping boorishness.'' Coming after years of generous American support, that irritated Truman.         ''They're thieves, every damn one of them,'' Truman said later, referring to Nationalist leaders. ''They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it's invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.''         General Chiang resigned as president of Nationalist China in January 1949 and fled to Taiwan that May, taking with him a national art collection that was kept in crates in Taiwan for years as the Chiangs clung to the ever-diminishing hope that they would some day take it back to Beijing.         Over the years, Madame Chiang's health wavered, and in 1976 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy, and later, a second one.         Her Final Years         Even after she moved to permanent residence in New York, she kept her finger on the pulse of Nationalist politics. She returned to Taiwan after her stepson died in January 1988. Even though she was nearly 90, she tried to rally her old allies. But Lee Teng-hui, chosen as vice president both because he was Taiwan-born and because he was considered a pushover by fellow Nationalists, proved more adept at politics than expected, and he gradually solidified his control.         Madame Chiang lived out her final years in New York, with a pack of black-suited bodyguards who cleared the lobby of her Gracie Square apartment building every time she entered or left. She returned to Congress for one last appearance in 1995.         Until this year, Madame Chiang maintained an annual tradition of receiving a few friends at her Manhattan apartment on her birthday. But this year, she came down with pneumonia, and was was unable to do that, the local Chinese press reported.         Her last public appearance was believed to be in January 2000, when she attended an exhibition of her watercolor paintings of traditional Chinese landscapes at the Queens headquarters of the World Journal, a prominent local Chinese newspaper. She was in a wheelchair, but was reported to be in good spirits, telling people there that she was very happy that day.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek on Oct. 25 and in some late editions on Oct. 24 referred imprecisely to her attempt to influence political control in Taiwan in 1988, after the death of her stepson, Chiang Ching-kuo, who had been president as well as chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party. Mme. Chiang tried unsuccessfully to block his successor as president, Lee Teng-hui, from succeeding him as chairman; she did not seek office for herself, nor was she eligible to do so.       
         Rosalie Allen, who came out of Pennsylvania coal country to become a popular singing cowgirl and yodeler in New York, where she was also the city's only country D.J. for a while, died on Sept. 23 in Palmdale, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure that followed diabetes and other ailments, said a friend, Alois Krtil. At the time of her death she used the name Julia Gilbert, with the surname being that of her last husband, Mr. Krtil said.         Miss Allen became known as Queen of the Yodelers after winning a national yodeling contest in 1939. As a singer her style was likened to Patsy Montana, and one of her most successful recordings was a version for RCA Victor of Montana's hit ''I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart.''         She was also known for her yodeling duets with Elton Britt. Two of their hits were ''Beyond the Sunset (Should You Go First)'' and ''Quicksilver.''         In September 1947, Miss Allen was part of the first country concert at Carnegie Hall, along with Ernest Tubb, Minnie Pearl and others. In the mid-1940's she became a partner in Rosalie Allen's Hillbilly Music Center on West 54th Street, one of the first record stores in the United States to sell only country music.         Miss Allen was perhaps best known to New Yorkers for playing host on the radio program ''Prairie Stars'' on WOV from 1944 to 1956. She parlayed her broadcast appeal into nightly live shows at the Village Barn, a national radio show, a local television show and an Armed Forces Radio Network show.         In an article about her radio career, The New York Times in 1946 called Miss Allen ''a rare four-leafed clover in a field that was one of man's last strongholds.''         Julia Marlene Bedra was born on June 27, 1924, in Old Forge, Pa. She was one of 12 children and her father was a chiropractor, according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.         By the time she was 9 she was working as a dishwasher to help pay family expenses. Listening to the radio inspired her to learn to sing, yodel and play her brother's guitar. She made her radio debut in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and then headed for York, Pa., where she was the featured vocalist with Shorty Fincher's Prairie Pals.         In 1943 she came to New York to sing on Denver Darling's ''Swing Billies'' radio show. According to an article in The Daily News earlier this year, she stalled for three months because she was frightened of the big city. But the chance to raise her pay from $15 a week to $98 ended her hesitation.         She moved in with a sister in Brooklyn and soon she was making $300 a week. In 1944 she became a regular on Zeb Carver's ''Hill Country Jamboree'' show, where her sunny personality prompted WOV to recruit her for a half-hour nightly show of her own.         By 1946 she was on the air up to two hours a night, singing and presenting guests like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Eddy Arnold and Hank Williams. In the late 1940's she became host of a local country show on NBC-TV.         As rock 'n' roll pushed country aside, she moved to Alabama and performed less, even though Montana urged her to return to the recording studio, according to Mr. Krtil. He said she was stopped by a combination of health and marital problems, as well as by disputes with Nashville producers.         Miss Allen had strong opinions about country music and wrote articles and columns for publications like National Jamboree, Country Sound Roundup and Hoedown. For example, in the Times interview, she expressed regret that so much ''New York corn'' was being substituted for fine Southern mountain music in the local scene.         She also differentiated between hillbilly and cowboy music, calling hillbilly a twangy novelty. She said, ''I think that people who don't like cowboy music are often those who can't face reality.''         Among the fan mail she received were not a few marriage proposals. Her answer to these epistles was usually enough to dissuade potential suitors: Mrs. Malcolm McGlasson.         She was unmarried at her death, and is survived by her daughter, Dorothy Bunch of Palmdale.       
         Dr. Margaret A. Johns, who showed that pheromones can set off hormonal changes in mammals when they activate receptors in a tiny nasal cavity, a process that can attract animals of the opposite sex, died Saturday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 75.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter Sara Johns Griffen.         Scientists had known of the nasal structure, called the vomeronasal organ, on each side of the nasal septum, for more than a century. But it was widely believed that the organ had gradually become functionless and that the odorless chemical messages known as pheromones were detected instead by the olfactory system.         Dr. Johns's research, published in the journal Nature in 1978, led other scientists to question, and later debunk, the long-held notion that humans were incapable of sensing pheromones.         In recent years, research has suggested that the vomeronasal organ acts on the human brain in its hypothalamus, which produces hormones and regulates appetite, anxiety, fear and other behaviors.         In her experiment, Dr. Johns, a graduate student at the time, found that female rats would start to ovulate if exposed to an outside stimulus, like male urine. She then blocked off the vomeronasal organ in several female rats and repeated the procedure. This time, the urine had no effect, suggesting that the pheromones were acting not on the sense of smell, but on the organ many assumed had no real purpose.         ''There was evidence of pheromone communication in insects and invertebrates, but she was the first one to find it in mammals,'' said Dr. Louis Monti-Bloch, who worked on studies in the early 1990's proving that pheromones can induce behavioral changes in humans. ''That inspired studies that explored whether these same pheromones were having an effect in humans.''         Today, scientists are developing synthetic pheromones that could have a range of medical uses, like relieving anxiety and easing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.         Born in Boston, Margaret Anne Johns earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College, but not until she was in her late 30's, after she had raised two children. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University.         In the early 1980's, she did research at Mount Sinai in New York showing that cells within the pituitary gland could absorb serotonin. Her paper, published in the journal Endocrinology in 1982, suggested that the hormone might have an effect on the anterior pituitary gland in mammals, which helps to regulate growth and ovulation, among other things.         Whether serotonin influences the anterior pituitary is an issue that many scientists debate to this day, said Dr. Marc Freeman, a professor of biological science and neuroscience at Florida State University.         Dr. Johns's first marriage, to Craig Johns, ended in divorce in the early 80's.         In addition to her daughter Sara, who lives in Kinderhook, N.Y., she is survived by her husband, H. Peter Stern; another daughter, Kate Johns, of Old Chatham, N.Y.; a brother, Stephen Bush of San Pedro, Calif.; three stepchildren; and eight grandchildren.       
         Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a retired Columbia University literary scholar whose extensive writings included pioneering books and essays in the feminist canon and a dozen highly erudite detective novels under the pseudonym Amanda Cross, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 77.         Professor Heilbrun, who had written of taking her own life in a 1997 book, ''The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty,'' committed suicide, said her son, Robert. She had not been ill, he noted yesterday. ''She wanted to control her destiny,'' he said, ''and she felt her life was a journey that had concluded.''         Aside from serving as an instructor at Brooklyn College in 1959-60 and as a visiting lecturer or professor at Yale, Princeton, Swarthmore and other colleges, Ms. Heilbrun spent her entire academic career at Columbia, joining the faculty in 1960 as an instructor of English and comparative literature and retiring in 1992 as the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities.         But she was best known as the author of nine scholarly books, including ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny,'' ''Reinventing Womanhood'' and ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' and scores of articles that interpreted women's literature from a feminist perspective, and as the author of the Kate Fansler mysteries. Her heroine, like her creator, was a professor of literature and a feminist.         The novels were ostensibly murder mysteries whose amateur sleuth sometimes sought clues in literary texts and a killer's motives in academic politics. Most were well received by readers, but some critics said the plots were thin and the social commentary thick, and that the real subjects were women's changing social positions, relationships with one another and struggle for independence.         The books offered scathing depictions of academic backbiting, observations on Ivy League social pretensions and thinly veiled, unflattering portraits of Columbia colleagues, including one professor who seemed to have been modeled after the writer Lionel Trilling.         Some critics complained that satiric wit and clever talk filled half a book before the victim fell dead, and that some of it sounded like an imitation of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. But devotees said it was all good fun, and some compared her work to the cerebral puzzles of Dorothy L. Sayers.         Fearing that her mystery writing might be seen by colleagues as frivolous and might even jeopardize her chances for tenure, Ms. Heilbrun concealed the identity of Amanda Cross for six years. In 1964 her first novel, ''In the Last Analysis,'' was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. ''Winning would have blown my cover,'' she recalled.         But after the 1970 publication of ''Poetic Justice,'' with its recognizable depiction of Columbia University's atmosphere after the student revolt of the late 1960's, Ms. Heilbrun's friends began to guess that she might be Amanda Cross, the author of three novels, including ''The James Joyce Murder.'' Later novels included ''Death in a Tenured Position,'' ''No Word from Winifred'' and ''The Puzzled Heart.''         Carolyn Gold Heilbrun was born on Jan. 13, 1926, in East Orange, N.J., the only child of Archibald Gold, an accountant, and Estelle Roemer Gold, who, her daughter would recall, ''sat at home and was bored out of her mind.'' The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Heilbrun was 6, and she became a voracious reader, devouring Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton mysteries and, as a teenager, the novels of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather.         She graduated from private schools in New York and from Wellesley College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in English. She was married in 1945 to James Heilbrun, a Harvard student who became a professor of economics at Fordham University. In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, and her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Margaret Heilbrun, of Brooklyn, and Emily Heilbrun, of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.         Enrolling in graduate school at Columbia, Ms. Heilbrun received a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1959. Her first notable essay was ''The Character of Hamlet's Mother,'' a 1957 article in Shakespeare Quarterly. It portrayed Gertrude as clever, not shallow, lucid rather than silly: ideas that were forerunners of feminism at the time, but hardly startling when the essay was reprinted in 1990 as part of ''Hamlet's Mother and Other Women.''         On the Columbia faculty, Ms. Heilbrun rose through the ranks: assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, full professor with tenure in 1972, Avalon Professor in 1985. In 1986 she became the first director of the university's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, which promotes feminist scholarship.         Her academic specialty was British modern literature, roughly from 1890 to 1950, an era that included Yeats, Conrad and Eliot, with a particular focus on the Bloomsbury group, made up of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster and other writers.         Although she was widely respected by feminist scholars, she complained when she retired that she was isolated by her male colleagues at Columbia. ''When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored,'' she told Anne Matthews in an interview for a New York Times Magazine article in 1992.         Throughout her academic career, and afterward, Ms. Heilbrun continued to write books and contribute articles to professional journals, newspapers and magazines. She wrote numerous book reviews and essays for Hers, a former column in The Times.         Her 1973 book, ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny: Aspects of Male and Female in Literature,'' brought her to prominence in the academic feminist movement. Rejecting traditional ideas of male and female and using examples from Greek literature, the Bible and other writings, she urged women to escape from what she called the prison of gender.         Ms. Heilbrun drew on her long interest in biography and autobiography for her 1988 book, ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' her first best seller, which focused on women writing about themselves and other women. Even accomplished women, like Virginia Woolf and Eudora Welty, tended to judge themselves on how well they fulfilled traditional expectations, she concluded.       
         Joan B. Kroc, a prominent philanthropist, a former owner of the San Diego Padres and the widow of Ray A. Kroc, the founder and chairman of the McDonald's Corporation, died on Sunday at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. She was 75. The cause was brain cancer, a spokesman said.         In 1998, Ms. Kroc gave $100 million to the Salvation Army to build and endow the Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center in San Diego and $25 million to the University of San Diego to establish its Institute for Peace and Justice. In the 1980's she gave $19 million to the University of Notre Dame to endow an institute for international peace studies.         Through foundations and in her own name, she also gave major gifts for AIDS research, hospice care, environmental causes, nuclear disarmament and programs to combat drug and alcohol abuse and hunger. In 1987, she became the first person to give the Democratic National Committee $1 million.         Joan Beverly Mansfield was born in St. Paul on Aug. 27, 1928. She and Mr. Kroc were married in 1969, a second marriage for both, and moved from Chicago to San Diego after he bought the Padres in 1974. After he died in 1984, she was active in managing the club until it was sold in 1990.         She is survived by a daughter, Linda Smith; a sister, Gloria Chadima of Minneapolis; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Beatrice Blyth Whiting, an anthropologist at Harvard and an expert on the influence of culture on personality, died on Sept. 29 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 89.         Dr. Whiting and her husband, Dr. John W. M. Whiting, a fellow Harvard anthropologist, traveled extensively to study parental practices and child behavior, hoping to identify aspects of human development found in all cultures.         In 1954, she and her husband began the Six Cultures Study of Socialization, a project that involved field studies in Mexico, India, Kenya, Okinawa, the Philippines and the United States. Their work with the project resulted in many scholarly articles.         Twelve years later, they founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi to conduct more intensive studies in Kenya.         In the 1980's, after their retirement from Harvard, the Whitings turned their attention to older children, directing the Comparative Adolescence Project.         Dr. Whiting developed a particular interest in the development of gender roles, a subject she covered in her 1988 book, ''Children of Different Worlds: The Formation of Social Behavior,'' written with Dr. Carolyn P. Edwards. Her book on the lives of Kenyan women, ''Ngecha: A Kenyan Community in a Time of Rapid Social Change,'' also written with Dr. Edwards, is to be published later this year.         Dr. Whiting, who joined Harvard's faculty in 1952, became one of the first women at the university to receive tenure when she was named professor of education at the graduate school of education in 1974. She was a graduate of Bryn Mawr and received a doctorate in anthropology from Yale in 1943.         She lived in Cambridge and in Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard.         Beatrice Blyth Whiting was born on Staten Island on April 14, 1914. She is survived by her daughter, Susan Whiting of Chilmark and Stuart, Fla. Her husband died in 1999.       
         Louise Day Hicks, the Boston public school official and City Council member whose opposition to busing to achieve school integration helped to polarize the city in the 1960's and made her a national symbol of racial division, died on Tuesday at her home in South Boston. She was 87.         Mrs. Hicks was the city's most prominent opponent of busing, saying it was not what parents, especially those in her almost-all-white South Boston neighborhood, wanted. To her supporters, she was a champion of working-class residents and neighborhood schools. To her opponents, she epitomized an unwillingness to breach a deep-seated racial divide in deeply segregated Boston.         ''She became the symbol, if you please, of someone who was against desegregating Boston schools,'' said Paul Parks, who was chairman of the education committee of the Boston N.A.A.C.P. in the 1960's, a former state secretary of education and a former president of the Boston School Committee. ''She would not admit segregation exists.''         Mrs. Hicks, a lawyer and the daughter of a prominent South Boston judge, spent a decade fighting against forced integration in Boston before it was ordered in 1974 by Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Federal District Court.         Mrs. Hicks was elected to the Boston School Committee in 1961. Two years later, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter declared that ''de facto segregation'' existed in the schools, citing a report that 13 schools were more than 90 percent black and significantly lacking in money. Mrs. Hicks, then the chairwoman, cast aside the issue when it was brought before the committee, asking that the board ''kindly proceed to educational matters.'' She was overwhelmingly re-elected that fall and immediately became a lightning rod for the issue.         In 1965, when Massachusetts enacted a law ordering districts to desegregate or lose state financing, Mrs. Hicks refused to back down. She said she felt that the Boston schools were being made a scapegoat by suburban legislators who wanted nothing more than to meddle in neighborhoods they knew nothing about. ''If the suburbs are so interested in solving the problems of the Negro,'' she said, ''why don't they build subsidized housing for them?''         Mrs. Hicks, the subject of numerous death threats, insisted she was not racist.         She refused to meet with Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, an ardent segregationist, telling a reporter that she did not want to be connected with him. ''The important thing is that I'm not bigoted,'' she once said.         Mrs. Hicks always insisted that she had the best interests of students in mind with her anti-busing crusade.         ''I have guarded your children well,'' she said in announcing her mayoral candidacy in 1967. ''I will continue to defend the neighborhood school as long as I have a breath left in my body.''         She did not focus on busing during the campaign, sidestepping the issue with the slogan ''You know where I stand.''         Despite a victory in the September primary, she lost the election by 12,000 votes to Kevin H. White, another first-time mayoral candidate of Irish descent who snatched up last-minute votes in the black neighborhoods of Roxbury and Mattapan.         Mrs. Hicks won election to the City Council by a landslide in 1969. In 1970 she won a race to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives, but was defeated in 1972. She was re-elected to the City Council in 1973 and 1975 and lost in 1977 and 1981, but filled a vacant seat for one year, 1979. Plagued by poor health, she then left local politics.         ''I think she was exemplary in her willingness to come to her own conclusions and really very bravely act on her convictions,'' said William M. Bulger, a former president of the State Senate and the University of Massachusetts and a native of South Boston. ''It's not true of everyone. In fact, there's a great deal of poll-taking at all times these days, but Mrs. Hicks had to recognize that she was taking a position during that time at odds with what the opinion molders certainly felt.''         Louise Day was born in South Boston on Oct. 16, 1916, although many who worked with her said she often lied about her age. She was the only daughter of William J. and Anna McCarron Day. Her mother died when Mrs. Hicks was 14, and she was especially close to her father, a lawyer, judge and businessman, whom she cited as her inspiration to become a lawyer. She graduated from Wheelock Teacher's College in Boston in 1938 and received an education degree from Boston University in 1952 and a law degree from there in 1955.         She married John Hicks, an engineer, in 1942. He died of cancer in 1968. She is survived by a son, William. Another son, John, vanished in 1978.       
         Dorothy J. Farnan, a high school English teacher whose friendship with the poet W. H. Auden and his companion, Chester Kallman, enabled her to write ''Auden in Love,'' a book about their life together, died on Oct. 23 in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Ms. Farnan bridged the worlds of the flamboyantly bohemian Greenwich Village of the 1940's and the conventional milieu of her job as an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. At times her friend Auden, considered by many the best poet writing in English in the 20th century, even invited her students to tea.         Through Mr. Kallman, who was about her age, Ms. Farnan met his father, Eddie, whom she eventually married.         Edward Mendelson, a Columbia University professor and Auden's literary executor, said in an interview on Thursday that ''Auden in Love'' (Simon & Schuster, 1984) was important because it made it possible to understand the Auden-Kallman relationship, which endured for 34 years, ''in ways that would have been impossible without it.''         The book progresses from the time when the poet, then 32, met Mr. Kallman, a brilliant college student of 18, and traces the peaks and valleys of their relationship, including an exchange of wedding rings and Auden's murderous rage when he was first betrayed by his mercurial lover. It ends not with Mr. Kallman, a poet and librettist, discovering Auden's corpse in a Vienna hotel in 1973, but with Mr. Kallman's own lonely end just 15 months later.         Ms. Farnan had a special vantage point, and many but not all reviewers said she gave an unexpectedly detailed, intimate and accurate view of Auden's private life. ''What she remembered corresponded to things she could not have looked up,'' Professor Mendelson said.         The book oozes gossip, and some reviewers criticized this quality, including Julian Symons, writing in The Times Literary Supplement in London in 1985. Nevertheless, Mr. Symons said the book was an important addition to what he termed ''the Auden biographical corpus.''         Ms. Farnan argued that past Auden biographies had understated the importance of the Kallman relationship, and in so doing had ''discounted most of all Auden's need to love.'' She included a previously unknown Auden poem in the form of a letter written on Christmas Day 1941, in which the events of the Nativity are given outrageous counterparts in the relationship between Auden and Mr. Kallman.         It reads, in part:         Because mothers have much to do with your queerness and mine, because we have both lost ours, and because Mary is a camp name;         As this morning I think of Mary I think of you.         Dorothy Jeanne-Therese Farnan was born on June 29, 1919, in Winona, Minn., the only child of James Farnan, a lawyer, and the former Nanneta Von Starck. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in English from the University of Michigan, where in 1941 she met Mr. Kallman, a graduate student, ''young, blond and deliciously arrogant,'' in her words.         Mr. Kallman had met Auden in 1939 at a poetry reading in New York. The book's most memorable theme is Auden's determination to remain faithful to Mr. Kallman, even support him financially, as the younger man broke his heart again and again.         ''Chester fell in love for the first time again'' is a phrase that repeats through Ms. Farnan's narrative.         Mr. Kallman and Auden were living together in Michigan when Ms. Farnan met Mr. Kallman, and through him, Auden. Then she moved to Manhattan and lost track of both of them, until Mr. Kallman tapped her shoulder one day at the Waldorf Cafeteria. Soon, she and her best friend, Mary Valentine, were living a life of laughter and ideas, centered in Greenwich Village, revolving around Mr. Kallman, and liberally lubricated with wine of often dubious quality.         ''Those years with Auden, there was a sense of them being golden years,'' the Rev. Carla Valentine Pryne, Mary Valentine's daughter, Ms. Farnan's goddaughter and an Episcopal minister, said in an interview on Thursday.         Ms. Farnan fell in love with Mr. Kallman's father, Eddie, and married him -- ''somewhat illegally,'' she wrote in her book -- in 1948. After the death of Eddie's actual wife, they were legally married in 1975. He died in 1986.         Meanwhile, Ms. Farnan -- a very tall woman with naturally platinum hair, a penchant for rescuing stray cats and a passion for the Latin Mass -- was gradually rising in the New York City public school system. In 1986, she became the first woman to be head of the English department at Erasmus.         Veronica Warren, her successor in that job and now an assistant principal in New Jersey, recalled on Thursday how tough Ms. Farnan's standards were: even remedial-reading students had to study eight Shakespeare plays in their four years of high school.         ''She refused to believe that every student couldn't learn the classics,'' Ms. Warren said in an interview. ''She even considered American literature inferior.''         In her book, Ms. Farnan mentioned that she was only heeding Auden's advice: ''They don't need a paid teacher to learn to read Hemingway,'' he had told her.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 2 about Dorothy Farnan, a New York City teacher who wrote ''Auden in Love,'' a book about W. H. Auden and his companion, Chester Kallman, misstated the year in which she became chairman of the English department at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. It was 1966, not 1986.       
         Katharine Thomas O'Neil Bidwell, a patron of music and education who headed the Metropolitan Opera Guild in the 1980's, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66 and also had a home on Fishers Island, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bidwell was born in Dayton, Ohio, and started a musical career when she joined the St. Louis Municipal Opera at 18. She graduated in 1959 from Sarah Lawrence College, where she became a trustee and sponsored programs in the performing arts.         She joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1966, became first vice president in the late 1970's and was president and chief executive from 1979 to 1986. After that, until 1996, she was the Lincoln Center's director of special projects.         For many years Mrs. Bidwell also headed the advisory council at the New York City Opera. She founded the Katherine Bidwell Foundation for Young Singers and the patrons' program of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped in commissioning new works.         She was also a trustee of the Greenwall Foundation, which supports emerging artists, Westminster Choir College and the London School of Music and Dramatic Arts.         el1 Mrs. Bidwell's first marriage, to Stephen E. O'Neil, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, J. Truman Bidwell Jr.; a daughter, Molly O'Neil Frank, of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen T. O'Neil, of Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and Charles Thomas O'Neil, of Stockbridge, Mass.; a brother, Charles Thomas, of San Diego; a sister, Frances Martin, of St. Louis; and eight grandchildren.       
         Evan Ruderman, whose theatrical monologue about her own experience with AIDS was a major part of a documentary shown on public television in 1996, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 44.         The cause was complications of AIDS, her mother, Dr. Cydelle Berlin, said.         Ms. Ruderman was active in feminist and political causes. She dropped out of high school to become an apprentice electrician, and became a leader of organizations promoting jobs for women in blue-collar trades, including Women in the Trades and NEW, whose name is an acronym for nontraditional employment for women.         She later worked toward her high school diploma and received two years of college-level training to become a full member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 3. She was the fifth woman in the group, her mother said.         Ms. Ruderman, who was born in Brooklyn on March 28, 1959, learned she was H.I.V. positive in 1988 and developed full-blown AIDS in 1990.         Her mother, Dr. Berlin, was involved in AIDS education, but Ms. Ruderman did not tell her that she was H.I.V. positive until 1989. The year before, Dr. Berlin had started a group to visit schools and other places to explain AIDS. Dr. Berlin was considering theatrical use of an anonymous monologue by someone suffering from AIDS when her daughter told her she had written it. Ms. Ruderman and her monologue then became part of the production.         In 1996, PBS showed a documentary by the producer Roger Weisberg about her mother's group, called the Star Theater. The group was first affiliated with Mount Sinai Medical Center and is now sponsored by St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Ms. Ruderman played a featured role in the production, titled ''Sex and Other Matters of Life and Death.''         Ms. Ruderman retired as an electrician 11 years ago with a full pension from her union, her mother said. She remained active in AIDS causes. In 2002 at the Worlds AIDS Conference in Barcelona, Spain, she represented New York area women who were unable to attend the larger gathering.         Ms. Ruderman is survived by her mother, who lives in Manhattan; her father, Robert, of Manhattan; her stepmother, Vicki Fian of Manhattan; her sister, Leigh Roumila of Ridgewood, N.J.; and her brothers, Jamie, of Maplewood, N.J., and Adam, of Manhattan.         Correction:  November 27, 2003, Thursday  An obituary of the AIDS activist and educator Evan Ruderman on Friday gave an incorrect surname for her surviving stepmother. She is Vicki Sufian, not Fian.       
         Audrey B. Love, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in Key Biscayne, Fla. She was 100.         Mrs. Love, who also had an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan, was the daughter of Edyth Guggenheim and Adm. Louis Josephthal, and was raised in Manhattan in a family devoted to the arts and philanthropy.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Smith College and soon afterward, on a trip to India in 1926, met her future husband, C. Ruxton Love Jr. Mr. Love, who died in 1971, was a Wall Street financier and diplomat, and the couple pursued a shared interest in collecting art.         In World War II, Mrs. Love served as president of the American Women's Voluntary Service. She was also a director of the New York Infirmary Hospital and a member of the Committee for Deaf and Dumb Children at Lenox Hill Hospital.         The Loves' collection of Napoleonic art was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978.         She was a founding member of the Lowe Art Museum of the University of Miami. Pieces from her collection of Georgian silver were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 2002.         Mrs. Love, who briefly pursued a career in the theater in her youth, was a lifelong patron of the opera. She contributed to the construction of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan. On an evening only days before her death, she was in her front row seat for a production of ''La Traviata'' by the Florida Grand Opera, which she had helped finance.         Mr. Love is survived by two daughters, the archaeologist Iris Love of New York City and Noel Gross of Saddle River, N.J., Wellington, Fla., and Bridgehampton, Long Island, and one grandson.       
         C. Z. Guest, one of the monarchs of New York society who was a perennial selection on the best-dressed list, a noted horsewoman and an authority on gardening, died yesterday at home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 83.         Mrs. Guest's interest in horticulture began when she was a child following the family gardener around her parents' estate on the North Shore of Boston. Her name then was Lucy Douglas Cochrane, but she soon became C. Z. when her brother, Alexander, could not pronounce ''sister.'' Embarking on a writing career relatively late in life, she was the author of books on gardening and a children's book, ''Tiny Green Thumbs.'' She also wrote a syndicated weekly column that appeared in 350 newspapers across the nation.         Mrs. Guest began her writing career while recovering from a horseback riding accident in 1976. While she was convalescing, frequent telephone calls from friends about their gardening problems prompted her first book, ''First Garden,'' which was illustrated by her ''very dear friend'' Cecil Beaton and which had an introduction by another ''dear, dear friend,'' Truman Capote.         In his introduction, Capote described Mrs. Guest working in her garden: ''There, with her baskets and spades and clippers, and wearing her funny boyish shoes, and with her sunborne sweat soaking her eyes, she is a part of the sky and the earth, possibly a not too significant part, but a part.''         Beaton and Capote were only two in a legion of celebrities and jet-setters who surrounded Mrs. Guest throughout her vivid life. When she was married in 1947 to Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, an international polo star, heir to the Phipps steel fortune and a second cousin of Winston Churchill, the ceremony was held at the home of Ernest Hemingway in Cuba, with Hemingway serving as best man.         Until Mr. Guest's death in 1982, the couple was prominent in international social circles, hunting in India with the Maharaja of Jaipur and frequently entertaining the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who subsequently became godparents of their children, Cornelia and Alexander.         C. Z. Guest was considered one of America's classic beauties. The writer Jill Gerston once described her this way: ''With her pale skin, blue eyes, ash-blond hair and trim figure, she is cut from the same cool, silky cloth as Grace Kelly. It is a patrician beauty that is indigenous to socially registered enclaves like Palm Beach and Southampton, a sporty, outdoorsy look that eschews makeup, hairspray and anything trendy. She has an outspoken, coolly self-assured manner and a throaty, well-modulated voice with a trace of a British accent.''         In 1962, Time magazine did a lengthy article on American society and apotheosized Mrs. Guest on its cover as the model of horsy high society. She posed in front of her Long Island estate wearing a button-down shirt and tie and jodhpurs, a sleek hound at her side, the personification of old-guard chic. Truman Capote once described Mrs. Guest as the incarnation of understated elegance and said she was ''a cool vanilla lady.'' John Fairchild, then publisher of Women's Wear Daily, described her as ''Southampton, Long Island American, Ivy League blond.'' British Vogue said she had ''the face of a flower.''         Often adorned by Mainbocher, Givenchy and Adolfo, she was chosen by the New York Dress Institute as one of the best-dressed women in the world early in the 1950's and remained on the list for years until her elevation to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Guest was also the designer of a small fashion collection introduced in 1985 and at the time made up principally of cashmere sweaters. ''I will only sell what I like to wear,'' she said after her sweaters had been displayed flung casually around the shoulders of models at the semiannual show of the designer Adolfo. A limited sportswear line was licensed in 1986 and in 1990 she came out with a fragrant insect repellent spray and other garden products.         Lucy Douglas Cochrane was born in Boston on Feb. 19, 1920, the second of five children of Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker, and Vivian Cochrane, the former Vivian Wessell. Her father died when she was 6. She was educated by tutors and later graduated from the Fermata School in Aiken, S.C. She made her debut in 1937, and was voted the glamour girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a contest held in 1939, which prompted a brief fling as a showgirl. She appeared in a 1943 revue on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and in a revival of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway in 1944. She spent six months in Hollywood attending 20th Century Fox's studio school but never appeared in a film.         ''My ambition was to be a successful enough actress to get myself thrown out of the Social Register,'' she once said. ''I had no talent at all but I enjoyed every minute of my experience.'' It was also during this period that she took off for Mexico, where Diego Rivera painted her as a nude odalisque. When she became engaged to Mr. Guest, her portrait, which had reportedly been displayed in a Mexico City bar, was bought by her fiancé's family.         Mrs. Guest became interested in volunteer work as a debutante in Boston and was active in numerous charitable organizations over the years, including the Children's Research and Asthma Institute, the Police Athletic League and the March of Dimes.         For years she was chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball and was a favorite of society columnists, who often mentioned her lunching with such friends as Elsa Maxwell, Mrs. William Paley, Mrs. Earl Smith, Doris Duke and Estée Lauder. They also mentioned her riding in the hunt country of Virginia, taking in the polo matches at the Piping Rock Club on Long Island, working hard on her orchids in her greenhouses or walking the grounds of Templeton, her estate on Long Island, trailed by a string of hunting dogs.         During the 1930's and 40's she was one of society's leading hostesses. ''She was very comfortable with all kinds of people, which is not common for a woman who's born to the purple, so to speak,'' her friend Eppie Lederer (the advice columnist Ann Landers) once observed.         The Guests jointly owned racing stables, with Mr. Guest supervising those in Chantilly, France, and Mrs. Guest supervising others in Middleburg, Va.. She loved exercising her horses and did so most mornings. For years she competed in the leading horse shows.         In 1984, Mrs. Guest was named commissioner general of the American garden exhibit of the International Garden Festival in Liverpool, England. The project, jointly sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the United States Forest Service, was a memorial to members of the Army Air Force who were killed in World War II.         Mrs. Guest was amused when her daughter, Cornelia was hailed by Life magazine as ''the debutante of the year'' in 1982 and herself became the darling of columnists and photographers.         In addition to her son Alexander, of Hunterdon County, N.J., and her daughter, Cornelia, of Old Westbury, she is survived by two stepsons, Winston Guest of Palm Beach, and Frederick, of New York, and three grandchildren.         ''I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend,'' C.Z. Guest once said.

         Ann Cornelisen, an American expatriate writer who brought spry and steely language to her evocative books about the poverty-stricken South of Italy, died on Wednesday at her home in Rome, Ga. She was 77.         The cause was not disclosed by her funeral home, and she had no immediate survivors.         In 1954 Ms. Cornelisen -- 27, divorced and with a degree from Vassar -- arrived in Italy eager to pursue archaeology. She stayed about 20 years in the villages of the Abruzzi region helping to establish 300 nurseries for Save the Children, a nonprofit organization. She lived as a native, observed acutely and wrote books that are sensitive, incisive and often humorous.         Her first and best-known book, ''Torregreca: Life, Death, Miracles'' (1969, Little, Brown), was reprinted by Steerforth Press last year, eliciting a new round of favorable reviews.         The strength of her work was partly her feeling of place. ''The South is not the gentle, terraced landscape of Renaissance painting,'' she wrote in ''Women of the Shadows: Wives and Mothers of Southern Italy'' (1976). ''It is a bare, sepia world, a cruel world of jagged, parched hills, dry riverbeds and distant villages where clumps of low houses cling together at the edges of riverbanks.''         It is partly her recording of personal details that initially seem funny, then become thought-provoking. In ''Torregreca,'' local women asked her if shaving under her arms lessened her ''sexual powers.''         Often she lets people speak for themselves, as she did with a woman left home while her husband traveled to Milan or Germany to find work.         ''Call that power, if you want,'' the woman said. ''To us it's just killing work. That's what our lives are. We're born knowing it.''         Her books include ''Vendetta of Silence'' (Little, Brown, 1971), ''Strangers and Pilgrims: The Last Italian Migration'' (Holt, 1980), ''Any Four Women Could Rob the Bank of Italy'' (Holt, 1983) and ''Where It All Began: Italy, 1954'' (Dutton, 1990). ''Women of the Shadows'' was republished by Steerforth in 2001.         Many reviewers were struck by how little she revealed of herself in books that were essentially autobiographies. In reviewing ''Where It All Began,'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wrote in The Washington Post: ''I have the feeling that we are being cheated of some immense inner drama by a ladylike reserve, a feeling I'm quite sure Cornelisen would deem vulgar.''         Ann Cornelisen was born in Cleveland on Nov. 12, 1926, and grew up in middle-class surroundings in Chicago before going to Vassar. Her brief marriage is mentioned only in passing in ''Where It All Began.''         ''We hear only that it failed -- not why, nor how she felt about it,'' Richard Eder wrote in The Los Angeles Times when reviewing ''Where It All Began.'' When she left Paris for Italy, the scene she described could be about ''a nervous girl going to boarding school,'' Mr. Eder wrote. She went equipped with what her mother believed were the essentials: ''several evening dresses, the silk shoes that matched, silk dresses, a suit and my calling card.''         Over eight years she lived in Rome and Florence. Her real adventure began when she met Gianna Thompson, the daughter of a Milanese aristocrat, who ran Save the Children's operation in the Abruzzi region. Ms. Cornelisen arrived in a jeep for a visit and stayed for about two decades, going from village to village to set up nurseries.         Meanwhile, her books sold well and received good reviews. Peter Nichols, in The Times Literary Supplement, called Ms. Cornelisen ''a great recorder.'' He wrote, ''She avoids any resemblance to a sociological report, although she is handling a serious sociological problem.''         She could also handle lighter fare. Her novel ''Any Four Women Could Rob the Bank of Italy'' involves six foreign women in a sleepy Tuscan village who decide to rob a mail train. They are motivated by feminist sentiments as much as by greed.         ''I say women are as innately evil and grasping or selfish as men and fully as criminal,'' one character says. ''They have a right to equal suspicion.''       
         Dorothy Loudon, the actress and comedian who won a Tony Award in 1977 for her portrayal of Miss Hannigan, the mean-spirited orphanage headmistress in the hit musical ''Annie,'' died yesterday. She was 70.         Lionel Larner, her friend and manager, told The Associated Press that she died of cancer at a New York hospital.         With a big, brassy voice, bulging blue eyes and a mesmerizing array of facial gymnastics, Ms. Loudon created the perfect villain in Miss Hannigan, a screaming, scheming, boozing harridan whose ''Little Girls'' number brought down the house eight times a week.         Ms. Loudon's was the standout performance of the 1977-78 theater season, no small feat in a year that featured the likes of Al Pacino, Julie Harris and Colleen Dewhurst. She won the Tony Award for leading actress in a musical over her 13-year-old co-star, Andrea McArdle, who played the title role.         Her success in ''Annie'' came after a life devoted to performing, a career that included television, film and roles in Broadway shows both acclaimed and better off forgotten. She was nominated for two other Tony Awards: in 1979 for ''Ballroom,'' which lasted only four months; and in 1969 for ''The Fig Leaves Are Falling,'' which ran only four days.         Ms. Loudon was born in Boston on Sept. 17, 1933, the daughter of James and Dorothy Shaw Loudon, and showed an early interest in performing, learning some 1,500 songs from her mother, who played piano in a Boston department store. She attended Syracuse University and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts before landing a role, at age 21, in a comedy revue that poked fun at musical legends like Ella Fitzgerald.         She quickly established herself in New York's vibrant cabaret scene, where she headlined at clubs like the Blue Angel with the comedians Elaine May and Mike Nichols. In 1962, she became known to millions of television viewers when she was signed as a replacement for Carol Burnett -- whom she somewhat resembled in looks and comic style -- on the ''Garry Moore Show.''         Despite her success, however, she did not think her talents were particularly suited to television. ''I belong in the theater,'' she said in a 1977 interview. ''I have to work off the instant reactions of the audience.''         So it was that also in 1962, Ms. Loudon made her Broadway debut in ''Nowhere to Go But Up,'' a musical revue whose title proved prophetic. The show closed in a week, but Ms. Loudon's performance was cited by several critics for her big voice and bigger laughs.         Giving excellent performances in lousy productions would become a specialty for Ms. Loudon, who had roles in shows like ''Noel Coward's Sweet Potato'' which bombed on Broadway in November 1968, and a 1971 musical based on Nabokov's ''Lolita,'' which died out of town.         Out of town was, in fact, where Ms. Loudon often ended up supporting herself, in national tours of shows and nightclub gigs. The exile ended when her old friend Mr. Nichols, a producer of ''Annie,'' persuaded her to try out for the role of Miss Hannigan. She had not worked as an actress in two years, but she nailed the audition.         Ms. Loudon's success in ''Annie'' led to several more Broadway roles, including ''West Side Waltz'' (1981), opposite Katharine Hepburn, and ''Noises Off'' (1983), as a diva in a sinking production.         Although she was passed over for the role of Miss Hannigan in the movie version of ''Annie'' -- Ms. Burnett was cast -- Ms. Loudon did a few films, including ''Garbo Talks'' (1984) and ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         Her association with fabulous flops resumed in 1990, when she appeared in ''Annie 2,'' the much-maligned sequel, which closed on the road. Last year, she was forced by deteriorating health to withdraw from the Broadway revival of ''Dinner at Eight.'' Marian Seldes took over the role.         According to The Associated Press, Ms. Loudon is survived by two stepchildren from her marriage to Norman Paris, who died in 1977.         Despite a life spent on stage, Ms. Loudon described herself in the 1977 interview as a shy person who survived on instincts during shows and ran out of the theater after them.         ''I reach back and get it from somewhere,'' she said. ''Something's working up in my head.''       
         Dorothy Loudon, the actress and comedian who won a Tony Award in 1977 for her portrayal of Miss Hannigan, the mean-spirited orphanage headmistress in the hit musical ''Annie,'' died on Saturday. She was 70.         Lionel Larner, her friend and manager, told The Associated Press that she died of cancer at a New York hospital.         With a big, brassy voice, bulging blue eyes and a mesmerizing array of facial gymnastics, Ms. Loudon created the perfect villain in Miss Hannigan, a screaming, scheming, boozing harridan whose ''Little Girls'' number brought down the house eight times a week.         Ms. Loudon's was the standout performance of the 1977-78 theater season, no small feat in a year that featured the likes of Al Pacino, Julie Harris and Colleen Dewhurst. She won the Tony Award for leading actress in a musical over her 13-year-old co-star, Andrea McArdle, who played the title role.         Her success in ''Annie'' came after a life devoted to performing, a career that included television, film and roles in Broadway shows both acclaimed and better off forgotten. She was nominated for two other Tony Awards: in 1979 for ''Ballroom,'' which lasted only four months, and in 1969 for ''The Fig Leaves Are Falling,'' which ran only four days.

         Lotte Berk, the dancer who gave her name to a no-nonsense system for achieving slim waists, trim thighs and taut bottoms that became a must for glamorous women in the 1960's, died on Nov. 4 in England. She was 90 and had lived there in Hungerford, Berkshire, since retiring about 20 years ago.         A German-born ballet dancer who settled in Britain, she devised a set of disciplined exercises called the Lotte Berk Method. Blending elements of yoga and dance with stretches and pelvic gyrations, she and her disciples have toned bodies, including many rich and famous ones, in studios on both sides of the Atlantic. Many studios using her method still operate.         Lotte Berk was a phenomenon of the 1960's scene of swinging London. Most of those fads ran their course. But the quest for a sleek contour, which she led for many years in her own exercise center, lived on.         Her message of rigorous exercise, at the barre and on the floor, spread without much advertising and largely by word of mouth. The message, preached in many exercise studios, was videotaped for those who want privacy and trust in their own self-discipline.         Lieselotte Heymansohn was born to a well-to-do father in Cologne -- her mother died when she was a child -- and studied modern dance with Mary Wigman in Cologne, against her father's wishes. At 20, she married a British dancer, Ernest Berk, with whom she had a daughter, Esther.         They performed in Germany between the wars but fled to England when the rise of Hitler made a serious career impossible for her as a Jew in Germany.         Ms. Berk performed with some modern dance companies, living as a free spirit in what was known as an open marriage, and in the 1950's began the work that established her reputation from London to New York and California.         There are differing versions of that beginning. According to one, she suffered a serious spinal injury in a car accident and by dint of willpower exercised her way out of a wheelchair. Another is that she realized what middle-age flab was doing to her petite dancer's body.         With the help of her legendary self-control and an osteopath, she devised a regimen of training to restore her musculature and body posture. For strength and suppleness, she concentrated on the abdominals, the pelvic region and the lower back, engaging them in isometric movements, lying on the carpet or facing a mirror at the barre.         Men were barred from her original basement studio off Oxford Street in central London. The names she gave her pelvic exercises and muscle tweaks had a decidedly earthy flavor with sexual connotations.         Her marriage to Ernest Berk lasted about 30 years, and she is survived by their daughter, Esther Fairfax, of Hungerford. According to The Guardian in London, Ms. Berk stated that she had been married seven times, ''twice on paper.''       
         Sylvia Sebastiani, who married the boy next door and became the matriarch and later the chairwoman of one of America's most prominent wine families, died on Sunday in Sonoma. She was 87.         Mrs. Sebastiani, who was also the author of a cookbook of family recipes, had given up day-to-day control of the Sebastiani winery several years ago because of failing health.         For 45 years, she had been known as the first lady of Sonoma, a renowned cook and hostess. She and her husband, August Sebastiani, were philanthropists whose gifts included property for the Sonoma Valley Hospital.         In 1980, she inherited Sebastiani Vineyards and Winery after the death of her husband.         In 1986, she replaced her elder son, Sam Sebastiani, who had embarked on an ambitious and costly plan to focus on higher-quality wines, as head of the winery with her younger son, Don Sebastiani.         Of the firing, which started a long family feud, Mrs. Sebastiani would say only that she loved her three children equally, but that she and Sam ''just don't make wine together.''         Under Don Sebastiani, a former state legislator, the winery prospered, expanding its brands and holdings into the Central Valley.         Sam Sebastiani established the Viansa Winery and Italian Marketplace south of Sonoma. The family eventually reconciled.         Mrs. Sebastiani was born Sylvia Scarafoni on May 10, 1916, in Cordelia, Calif., the daughter of Italian immigrants. In 1927 the family moved to Sonoma, settling in a house across the street from August Sebastiani's parents, who owned much of the town. The two families quickly became friends. The Sebastianis grew grapes and made wine. The Scarafonis kept cows and produced milk on a ranch in Schellville.         August and Sylvia were childhood sweethearts, going to school together, dating and spending Sundays at family dinners. In 1936 they married.         Until her husband's death, Mrs. Sebastiani spent much of her time in the kitchen, preparing meals for family members and wine salesmen.         Three years ago, the Sebastiani family sold its Central Valley winemaking operations and six wine brands for $295 million. The family kept the historic winery in Sonoma, with Mrs. Sebastiani's daughter, Mary Ann Cuneo, as president.         In addition to her children, she is survived by her sister, Rose Scarafoni Millerick of Sonoma; 12 grandchildren; and 7 great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Sebastiani was chairwoman, she had an office, but she also kept a seat in the tasting room of the winery, greeting visitors and signing copies of her cookbook, ''Mangiamo: Let's Eat.''       
         Regina Ovesey, the first woman to be chief executive of an advertising agency recognized by the industry's main trade group, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, died on Dec. 13 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 82.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Candace Ovesey.         Ms. Ovesey started her agency, Ovesey & Company, in the 1940's, when advertising was heavily dominated by men. Though the agency had accounts from burglar alarms to wallpaper, it specialized in the fashion industry, creating campaigns for clients like Barneys and Kate Greenaway, a maker of children's clothing. In the 1980's, Ms. Ovesey began to work almost exclusively with Capezio, a maker of dance apparel.         Regina Haimo was born in Philadelphia, grew up in Los Angeles, and graduated from Stanford University.         Her husband, Lionel Ovesey, died in 1995. Ms. Ovesey is survived by two daughters, Candace, of Danbury, Conn., and Michele, of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Gisela Konopka, a pioneer in the study of troubled adolescents who provided groundbreaking insights on disruptive behavior among girls, died on Dec. 9 in Minneapolis. She was 93.         The cause was pulmonary edema, said Dr. Robert Blum, a friend and colleague, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. The Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health, named for Dr. Konopka, is at the university.         A retired professor of social work, Dr. Konopka was the author of several works, including ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict.'' The book, published in 1966, was one of the first in-depth examinations of the lives of troubled teenage girls.         ''All my life, it seems, I have talked about how people can't be bad just because they're black, or Jewish or women,'' Dr. Konopka told The Minneapolis Star Tribune in an interview for an article published in 2000. ''Well, they can't be bad just because they're young.''         Judith Kahn, director of the Konopka Institute, said ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict'' broke new ground in offering girls a chance to present their own perspectives.         ''No one before had really listened to troubled adolescents and to what they said they wanted and needed in their lives,'' Ms. Kahn said. ''It wasn't just a look at the data, it was a look at what was underneath the data.''         Born Gisela Peiper in Berlin, she joined the resistance movement after Hitler came to power and eventually fled Germany, arriving in the United States in 1941. She met her future husband, Paul, in Germany before her departure, and they married after he arrived in New York a short time later.         Dr. Konopka received a master's degree in social service administration from the University of Pittsburgh and joined the social work faculty at the University of Minnesota in 1947. She later received a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia.         She remained a professor at the University of Minnesota until her retirement in 1978. Her husband, Paul, an engineer at General Mills, died in 1976.         She is survived by a foster daughter, Patricia Dreyer, of Minnetonka, Minn.       
         Hope Lange, a film, television and stage actress noted for a natural comedic style and intelligent portrayals of women in difficult circumstances, work that brought her two Emmy Awards and an Academy Award nomination, died at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., on Friday. She was 70 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was an intestinal infection brought on by a bout of diverticulitis, according to Ms. Lange's husband, Charles Hollerith Jr.         With her naturally blond hair, lithe dancer's figure and simple, straightforward style, Ms. Lange won praise for her first film role as a young woman who befriended a temptress played by Marilyn Monroe at a bus stop in the 1956 romantic comedy ''Bus Stop.'' It was her next role, in the controversial melodrama ''Peyton Place,'' based on the Grace Metalious book of the same name about the torrid lives led behind closed doors by the residents of a picturesque New England town, that made her a star in 1957.         In the film Ms. Lange played Selena Cross, a teenage girl living in a shack on the wrong side of town, who is raped by her stepfather and is later accused of murdering him. Her earnest portrayal of the troubled high school student earned her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress. She went on to act alongside Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando in ''The Young Lions'' and starred with Joan Crawford in ''The Best of Everything.''         Ms. Lange was born in November 1933 in Connecticut to show business parents -- her father was a composer and arranger, and her mother was an actress. The family moved to Greenwich Village when Ms. Lange was a small child, and soon after Ms. Lange's father died, leaving her mother to support four children on her own. Her mother opened a restaurant, and Ms. Lange worked as a waitress. One day Eleanor Roosevelt, who had an apartment in the Village, walked by with Fala, her husband's beloved Scottish terrier, said Christopher Murray, Ms. Lange's son.         Fala was so entranced by the smell of the food cooking in the restaurant that he stood stock still, Mr. Murray said, until his mistress took him inside. Ms. Lange began walking Fala for Mrs. Roosevelt, Mr. Murray said, and was discovered when her picture appeared in the newspaper. She began modeling, which led to advertising work. Her first husband, the actor Don Murray, encouraged her to try acting, her son said, and Ms. Lange eventually began acting in films and later won two Emmy Awards for her portrayal of a widow in the television series ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''         Ms. Lange's two previous marriages, to Mr. Murray and to Alan J. Pakula, the film director, ended in divorce. In addition to her husband, Ms. Lange is survived by her son, Christopher, of Malibu, Calif., and a daughter, Patricia Murray of Arroyo Grande, Calif.       
         Helen Gustafson, a tea buyer and author who championed fine tea, pushed it onto the menu at Chez Panisse and other restaurants and taught the art of the afternoon tea, died on Dec. 14 at her home here. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Clair Gustafson.         She was ''the Alice Waters of the tea movement,'' said a friend, Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet magazine and former restaurant critic of The New York Times, in a reference to the founder of Chez Panisse.         Ms. Gustafson was tea's ambassador at a time when diners sipped French roast and other strong coffees but thought tea was limited to Lipton.         Two decades ago ''it was quite impossible to find a good cup of tea anywhere in America,'' James Norwood Pratt, the international tea authority and author, said last week. ''Now, it is only highly unlikely. The difference is Helen Gustafson.''         So many restaurateurs made pilgrimages to Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where Ms. Gustafson managed the tea service, that ''it had a ripple effect,'' Mr. Pratt said.         Ms. Gustafson, the author of ''The Agony of the Leaves: The Ecstasy of My Life with Tea'' and ''The Green Tea User's Manual,'' even organized tea parties in Berkeley, a center of political radicalism, at which she requested that women wear gloves and hats.         ''People who a decade before were chanting 'Two-four-six-eight, organize and smash the state!' would get dressed up and go to Helen's,'' said Kate Coleman, a journalist who was a leader in the Free Speech Movement of 1964.         Ms. Waters credited Ms. Gustafson with taking Chez Panisse's tea offerings ''to a different place,'' but described the relationship as ''rocky to the end.'' Sometimes Ms. Gustafson would awaken dishwashers on Sunday mornings to ask why the iron teapots had not been turned upside down to dry. She was fired several times but always refused to leave, her husband said.         Born in Minneapolis on Nov. 25, 1929, Ms. Gustafson grew up enjoying afternoon tea in the sunroom of her red brick house with her mother and grandmother. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in Scandinavian drama from the University of Minnesota.         She swept onto the food scene in the early 1970's when she became a hostess at the Swallow, a restaurant at the University of California Art Museum in Berkeley. ''I had the impression she was running it,'' Ms. Waters said, adding, ''It was a collective.''         When Ms. Gustafson, in vintage clothes and with a gardenia in her hair, began acting as hostess at Chez Panisse, she was so appalled by the Earl Grey on the menu that she confronted Ms. Waters, who gave her license to do something about it. Ms. Gustafson introduced teas like Yunnan, Assam and lemon verbena.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son, Paul, of Berkeley; a daughter, Jill, of Boston; and a brother, John, of Liverpool, N.Y.         A month before she died, friends gave Ms. Gustafson a final tea party at Chez Panisse. ''I've never seen so many people with thermometers fussing over water and how long it had to be boiled,'' said the general manager, Gilbert Pilgram.       
         Isabelle Stevenson, the president of the American Theater Wing for more than 30 years, its chairwoman for the last five years and one of the best-known figures in the theater world, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Laura said. She was 90.         She was perhaps best known to the public as the doyenne of the Tony Awards, Broadway's equivalent of the Academy Awards and the American theater's most widely recognized prize. The Tony Awards were founded by the Theater Wing in 1947 and named for Antoinette Perry, a former chairwoman who ran the organization during World War II. They are jointly administered by the wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association of Broadway theater owners and producers.         The Tony telecast, administered by a Tony Management Committee of five wing and five league representatives, means not only prestige but also money. It is shown each year just before summer vacation time, and the play that wins the Tony almost always enjoys extra tourist dollars. The Theater Wing's share of income from the award broadcast, along with fund-raising events, private contributions and membership fees, also supports its programs.         Mrs. Stevenson was responsible for several major innovations in her long tenure at the wing, which is primarily a service and education organization, building audiences for the stage as well as honoring excellence in the theater.         She inaugurated the series of ''Working in the Theater'' seminars, held twice a year at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and shown on cable television. The seminars bring together leading performers, playwrights, directors, producers and scenic and costume designers.         She also began a program of grants and fellowships to Off and Off Off Broadway theaters. Theater in Schools, begun under her auspices, sends professionals to high schools to talk about their craft and provides scholarships to high school graduates to further their theater training.         Mrs. Stevenson nurtured other Theater Wing programs, including the Hospital Program, which takes plays and cabaret shows to hospitals, nursing homes and AIDS centers and, for many years, a Theater for Children, which produced plays for thousands of New York public-school students each year. Another program, Introduction to Broadway, provides Broadway theater tickets for $2.50 to high school students in an attempt to develop the audience of the future.         For more than half a century, Tonys have been given only to Broadway plays and performers. For many of those years Mrs. Stevenson pressed for a change in rules that would permit Off Broadway plays to be eligible for Tony Awards. And for years she failed. ''When the Tonys started, there wasn't really any Off Broadway, so the rules said Broadway theaters,'' Mrs. Stevenson said frequently. ''That should be changed now. I think Off Broadway's contribution to the theater should not be ignored.'' At the time of her death, the rules still had not changed.         Mrs. Stevenson was born Isabelle Lubow in Vineland, N.J., on May 15, 1913, the daughter of Sonia Lubow and Samuel Lieberman, who were married but lived separate lives. She and her two sisters took their mother's name. The family moved from Philadelphia to Far Rockaway when she was 10 and, several years later, to Brooklyn.         At 14, to take off weight, she began dance classes in Manhattan and met Harry Foster, a producer from England who was interested in organizing a line of dancers. Young Isabelle was one of the 15 chosen for training. The group was later known as the Foster Girls and was a part of ''Earl Carroll's Vanities.'' She was picked up each night by her mother and taken home on the subway.         When the show was taken on the road, Mrs. Lubow refused to allow her daughter to travel with it. So Isabelle began doing solo dance acts in vaudeville and a short time later, formed an act with two young male dancers. The trio, billed as Nice, Florio and Lubow, played the RKO circuit, including the Palace in New York. They also played Britain and took part in a command performance for Queen Mary and King George V. Mrs. Lubow accompanied her daughter everywhere.         Mrs. Stevenson met her future husband during a booking in Australia. John Stevenson had come out from England and was working on a newspaper in Melbourne. He returned to New York as promotion manager of The New York Post, and they were married in 1937. Mr. Stevenson, later involved in marketing of books and records, died in February 2002.         ''There was no question of my working -- I wasn't Katherine Cornell or Helen Hayes,'' Mrs. Stevenson recalled in a 1997 interview, when asked why she gave up her dancing career. ''I went to the Traphagen School of Design, took dance classes and courses in journalism and then I went to work for my husband as women's editor.'' By then, there were two daughters, as well as her sister's child, whom the Stevensons treated as their own. She is survived by her daughters, Susan Brown of Manhattan and Laura Maslon of Venice, Calif.; her niece and foster daughter, Francine Ringold-Johnson of Tulsa, Okla.; two grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         In 1956 when all the children were in school, Mrs. Stevenson joined the board of the American Theater Wing, and when Helen Menken, then the president, died in 1965, she was elected president. She stepped down to become its chairman in 1998 and the next year was honored at a tribute at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.         The Theater Wing was known as the Stage Women's War Relief Fund when it was founded in 1917. It was renamed the American Theater Wing War Service Theater in 1939 and was known for its Stage Door Canteens in Manhattan and elsewhere. After the war, the wing established not only the Tonys Awards but also the Professional Training School, a theater school for returning soldiers, which existed from 1946 to 1965.         In 1980 a caricature of Mrs. Stevenson became the 1,000th likeness to join the gallery of theatrical figures at Sardi's Restaurant. In 1999 she received a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement.         ''I stood on the sidelines for half a century and watched other people receive Tony Awards,'' she said, ''and now at last I get my own.''       
         Vestal Goodman, a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience, died on Saturday in Celebration, Fla. She was 74.         The Associated Press reported her death based on information from funeral home officials and her own Web site. The cause was not given.         Mrs. Goodman and her husband, Howard Goodman, known as Happy, who died last year at 81, were cofounders of the Happy Goodman Family act. Friends said Mrs. Goodman never really recovered from her husband's death.         The Happy Goodman Family, whose enthusiastic and inspirational live performances recalled early camp-meeting evangelism, formed in 1949 and was on the road constantly for 50 years. They often appeared as part of Billy Graham Crusades.         The Happy Goodman Family recorded 15 No. 1 gospel hits and played more than 3,500 concerts. The family was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998.         Mrs. Goodman, who dreamed of being an opera star as a girl, brought operatic flourishes to gospel. She never forsook her signature beehive hairstyle, her floor-length beaded gowns or the white handkerchief she carried in her right hand. Fans often waved their own handkerchiefs back.         The family's music revived in popularity in the 1990's, taking its place beside the younger contemporary Christian musicians and groups.         In the 1980's, the Goodmans were featured on the ''PTL Club'' television show of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. They left the program in 1988, and were not linked to scandals involving the Bakkers.         The Happy Goodman Family also often featured Happy's brothers Rusty and Sam.         They were an inspiration to the current gospel great Bill Gaither, who included the Goodmans in more than 60 of his Gaither Homecoming videos, a popular series that was a precursor of music videos. Mrs. Goodman was featured on the current Gaither Homecoming tour and had been booked to continue with the tour into 2004. Her autobiography, ''Vestal!,'' was published in 1998.         The troubled country star George Jones told The Tennessean newspaper in 2002 that after he was nearly killed a few years ago in a drunk-driving accident north of Nashville, he sent for Mrs. Goodman, who came to pray with him in the hospital and became a spiritual mentor.         Mrs. Goodman is survived by a son, Rick; a daughter, Vicki; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Priscilla Comins Kidder, who rose to prominence as Priscilla of Boston, outfitting young brides as their numbers soared after World War II in embellished dresses that became synonymous with American matrimonial style, died on Sunday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 86.         Anticipating a surge in marriages after the war, Mrs. Kidder opened a bridal boutique in 1948 on Newbury Street in Boston. The Bride's Shop, as she called it, was an immediate success, with sales of more than $10,000 in its first week.         Mrs. Kidder's success put her increasingly in contact with the wealthy. Through a friend, Stanley Marcus of Neiman-Marcus, she obtained a storybook assignment in 1956, designing bridesmaids' gowns for Grace Kelly's wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco.         The stunning news coverage of the wedding added to Mrs. Kidder's celebrity. She dressed Rockefellers, Fords and Paleys and designed wedding dresses for Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci Baines Johnson, as well as Richard M. Nixon's daughters, Tricia and Julie.         When labor organizers found out that Mrs. Kidder's dresses were made in a nonunion factory in Charlestown, Mass., they threatened to protest at Luci Johnson's wedding in 1966. Mrs. Kidder's response, her son Robert recalled yesterday, was to have a union label stitched into the wedding dress at another factory, owned by a Harvard classmate of her husband, which did have some union workers.         Mrs. Kidder's wedding gown for Tricia Nixon in 1971 also became controversial, though less bitterly so, because it was sleeveless, which many people considered unusually revealing for that decade.         Priscilla Comins was born in 1916 in Quincy, Mass. After graduating from the New England School of Design in Boston, she was a buyer in the bridal section of R. H. White's department store there. She opened The Bride's Shop with her husband, James Kidder, a businessman whom she married in 1940. Eventually, the shop began wholesaling dresses to stores around the country under the Priscilla of Boston label.         Besides helping make sleeveless gowns popular, she made other changes that became trends.         ''When Priscilla began designing dresses,'' Mille Martini Bratten, editor of Bride's Magazine said, ''she applied lace to them and made them decorative. Previously, dresses had been relatively simple and unadorned.''         Mrs. Kidder retired in 1993. Last year, her store was sold to the May Department Store Company.         Mr. Kidder died in 2001. Survivors include two sons, Robert, of Ipswich, Mass., and Richard, of Boston; a daughter, Betsy, of Ipswich; two sisters, Natalie Cahill of Reading, Mass., and Marjorie Townsend of Lexington, Mass.; and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Margaret Singer, a leading expert on brainwashing who testified in several high-profile cases contending that various groups inappropriately manipulated their members to control their behavior, died on Nov. 23 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 82.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Sam.         In her long career, Dr. Singer investigated and testified about techniques used by North Koreans against American soldiers in wartime and the Symbionese Liberation Army's influence over the kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.         In the 1950's, Dr. Singer interviewed a number of American soldiers who had renounced the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea. The soldiers, she found, had been isolated and plied with propaganda, at times under the threat of physical harm.         Years later, she testified in defense of Ms. Hearst in a case that brought Dr. Singer national recognition and helped generate public curiosity about mind control.         Dr. Singer and her colleagues delved into a little known area of psychology at the trial, arguing that Ms. Hearst had helped rob a bank because she had been brainwashed to embrace the values of the Symbionese Liberation Army, which abducted her.         The group, the team argued, subjected Ms. Hearst to intensely stressful conditions, like isolating her from family and friends and locking her in a closet for six weeks, allowing its members to indoctrinate her and force a bizarre behavioral transformation.         Though Ms. Hearst was convicted, the trial bolstered Dr. Singer's reputation as an expert on mind control. In the following years, she repeatedly testified against the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.         In one case, a libel suit against The Daily Mail of London, she argued that the church was a cult that brainwashed its members by showering them with intense affection, a process she called ''love-bombing.''         Dr. Singer said that she had interviewed hundreds of members of the church and testified that its techniques for mind control were more powerful than those used by the North Koreans on their war prisoners. The church lost its case.         ''This has put us back to the start of the road again,'' Michael Marshall, an official of the church, said at the time of the lawsuit. ''But we shall continue to fight for recognition and to show that we are a genuine religious movement.''         Dr. Singer went on to testify as an expert witness in dozens of cases against groups she described as destructive cults. Former members of the groups or the anguished families of members, like some of the people who lost relatives among the Branch Davidians in the Waco, Tex., in 1993, would often seek her advice.         Several members of the People's Temple, with Dr. Singer's help, left that group before 900 people committed mass suicide in Guyana in 1978.         Dr. Singer would often help win lawsuits against groups that former members claimed had lured them into dark, insular worlds that left them psychologically traumatized.         ''Her testimony would help people understand the clinical impact of a cult's manipulation and exploitation,'' said Dr. Richard Ofshe, a sociology professor at the University of California at Berkeley who worked with Dr. Singer for 20 years. ''There was a constant stream of people who would go into these organizations and end up in psychiatric emergency rooms.''         Dr. Singer's battles made her a target for harassment and death threats. At times, she found dead animals on her doorstep.         Margaret Thaler Singer was born in Denver and earned her bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Denver. She became an adjunct professor at Berkeley in the 1950's.         Dr. Singer conducted several widely known studies on schizophrenia and was a renowned family therapist. She spent much of her career at Berkeley, but also taught at the University of Rochester and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         In addition to her son, Dr. Singer is survived by her husband, Dr. Jerome R. Singer; a daughter, Martha Singer, also of Berkeley; and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Bates, a leading expert on the way infants develop language and an outspoken critic of the theory that humans are endowed at birth with a language module, died on Sunday at her home in San Diego. She was 56.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Jeffrey Elman, a close friend and a colleague at the University of California, San Diego.         Dr. Bates, a professor of cognitive science at U.C.S.D. and the director of its Center for Research in Language, was known for her very public stance in the debate on nature versus nurture, that is, how much of human behavior is genetic and how much is learned from the environment.         Dr. Bates thought all development, including the acquisition of language, rested on a foundation of general mental abilities. For example, humans drive cars not because their brains contain car-driving modules but by using various visual, motor and focusing skills, which are parts of the brain's wider repertoire.         Language is special and unique, Dr. Bates said, but its specialness is derived from the interaction of bits and pieces in the brain that are recruited for many purposes. Defining language as ''a new machine built out of old parts,'' Dr. Bates spent her career working out the details of that concept.         In putting forth her ideas, Dr. Bates criticized the theories of the linguist Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleague Dr. Steven Pinker, the psychology professor, now at Harvard. They contend that infants have a high degree of early knowledge and that development is more a matter of unfolding inborn traits.         Frequent sparring between the two sides, one based in California, the other in Massachusetts, led to the aphorism that much of cognitive neuroscience lay within the dynamic pull of a west pole and an east pole. Dr. Bates was ''queen of the west pole,'' Dr. Elman said.         Dr. Pinker said in an interview: ''As much as we locked horns, I had a huge amount of respect for her intellect and for keeping people like me honest. In anticipating her criticisms, she forced me to do better work.''         Dr. Bates conducted studies on more than 20 languages on four continents, showing how so-called universals of language like noun-verb agreement vary significantly in specific languages.         She studied infants born with extensive damage to the brain's language areas and found that their language abilities developed normally. In recent work, she found that there was a significant overlap in areas of the brain involved in processing language and areas involved in processing environmental sounds like trains whistling, cows mooing and doors slamming. She concluded that all these areas were specialized for meaningful sounds, not just language.         Elizabeth Ann Bates was born Wichita, Kan. After graduating from St. Louis University, she earned a doctorate in human development from the University of Chicago.         In 1983, she joined the psychology department at U.C.S.D. and in 1989 became the director of the Project in Cognitive and Neural Development at the Center for Research in Language. She wrote or was a co-author of 10 books, including the influential 1996 volume ''Rethinking Innateness,'' and more than 200 articles.         Dr. Bates is survived by her husband, George Carnevale, a fluid physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a daughter, Julia Carnevale.
