        Juliet Berto, who starred in the Jean-Luc Godard films ''Weekend,'' ''La Chinoise'' and ''Le Gai Savoir,'' died of cancer on Wednesday. She was 42 years old.         Juliet Berto, who starred in the Jean-Luc Godard films ''Weekend,'' ''La Chinoise'' and ''Le Gai Savoir,'' died of cancer on Wednesday. She was 42 years old.         Made famous by ''Weekend,'' Mr. Godard's 1966 classic about a group of people taking to the roads to escape a riot-torn Paris, Miss Berto went on to play a major role in Alain Tanner's ''Middle of the World'' (1974), to play Celine in Jacques Rivette's ''Celine and Julie Go Boating'' (1974) and to co-star with Bulle Ogier in Mr. Rivette's ''Duelle'' in 1976. She then began to direct and had a success with her first effort, ''Neige'' (''Snow''), a 1981 docudrama about drug trafficking that she worked on with Jean-Henri Roger.         She also co-starred with Alain Delon in 1976 in Joseph Losey's award-winning film ''Mr. Klein.''       
        Virginia Thompson Adloff, an author and teacher who wrote extensively on the countries of Southeast Asia and French-speaking Africa, died on Tuesday at the home of her sister in La Jolla, Calif. She was 86 years old and a longtime resident of Manhattan.         Virginia Thompson Adloff, an author and teacher who wrote extensively on the countries of Southeast Asia and French-speaking Africa, died on Tuesday at the home of her sister in La Jolla, Calif. She was 86 years old and a longtime resident of Manhattan.         Mrs. Adloff, who wrote under her maiden name, was married to Richard Adloff in 1943. Together they traveled for four decades and wrote several books on political, economic, social and cultural developments in Asia and Africa and on the islands of the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.         A native of Newtonville, Mass., she was raised in New York, received a bachelor's degree from Vassar and a doctorate from Columbia.         In World War II she was with the Office of War Information, specializing on Southeast Asia. After the war, she and Mr. Adloff contributed to scholarly journals, translated works from the French and wrote 11 books, including ''The Left Wing in Southeast Asia,'' published in 1950; ''The Emerging States of French Equatorial Africa,'' (1960), and ''The French Pacific Islands: French Polynesia and New Caledonia'' (1971).         From 1961 to 1972, Mrs. Adloff taught political science at the University of California. In the 1978-79 academic year she was the first Distingushed Scholar in Residence at the Institute of International Studies in Berkeley. In 1973 she became the first American woman elected to France's 250-member Academie des Sciences d'Outre-Mer.         She is survived by her husband and her sister, Juliet Pitt.       
        Lilly Dache, the milliner who flourished in this country in the decades when women selected their new hats before they chose their new clothes, died Sunday at a nursing home in Louvecienne, France. She was 97 years old.         Lilly Dache, the milliner who flourished in this country in the decades when women selected their new hats before they chose their new clothes, died Sunday at a nursing home in Louvecienne, France. She was 97 years old.         She was best known for her turbans, which she made by draping the fabric right on her customers' heads.         ''I would talk to the woman, ask her where she planned to wear the hat, what kind of dress she would wear it with,'' she told an interviewer at the end of her career. ''If she thought her nose was too long, I would make a hat with a brim and pull it down so you couldn't see the nose so much. I made everything with love, affection and excitement.''         Customers Included Film Stars         Her clients included Hollywood stars like Sonja Henie, Audrey Hepburn, Carole Lombard and Marlene Dietrich. Her last customer was Loretta Young, who arrived at her studio after Miss Dache decided to retire and bought her last 30 hats.         That was in 1968. Miss Dache's husband, Jean Despres, an executive at Coty Inc., the fragrance and cosmetics house, was retiring and she decided to close her business. Until his death last year, she and her husband divided their time between Delray Beach, Fla., and Meudon, France.         She had come to this country from France at the age of 16 and lived with an uncle in Atlantic City at first. But she soon went to New York, saw a sign in a window on a shop on Broadway saying ''Milliner Wanted'' and got the job.         She and another woman working there eventually bought the shop from the owner. She remembered the first hat she made as her own boss: a turban in four shades of blue, made from scraps lying in the shop.         A Leader in Fashion World         She was part of a group of milliners who were better known at the time than dress designers. They included John-Fredericks, Walter Florell, Laddie Northridge and Sally Victor.         In the 1930's depression era, women with limited funds tended to buy new hats instead of new clothes. In the 1940's clothing fabric was in restricted supply because of World War II, and hats continued in demand because they were showy.         But Miss Dache saw that millinery might not continue in fashion indefinitely, so she developed snoods with flowers, veils and bows as alternatives.         At the end of the 1950's she hired a young assistant from Chicago, Halston Frowick, who went on to become known for his own line of clothes. She also hired Kenneth Battell to take charge of her hair salon. By the 1960's elaborate coiffures by Kenneth, as he was known, swept hats off the fashion map.         Miss Dache did not mourn the end of the millinery era. After her retirement, she rarely wore a hat; she preferred wigs.         She is survived by her daughter, Suzanne Dache-Gould, who also became a milliner, and two grandsons. A funeral service will be held in Meudon on Thursday.       
        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.       
        Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jones instructed young women in charm, beauty and fitness as the owner-operator of the Candy Jones Career Girls School for more than 20 years. Later she and her husband, Long John Nebel, were co-hosts in Manhattan on a late-night talk and interview show, first on Radio Station WOR and then on WMCA. When Mr. Nebel died in 1978, she continued the all-night show until last year.         Candy Jones was born Jessica Arline Wilcox in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and educated in Atlantic City, where she won a beauty pageant at the age of 16. A trip to Manhattan followed, as did a modeling career and small roles in such 1940's Broadway musicals as ''Mexican Hayride'' and ''Polonaise.'' In World War II she headed a U.S.O. troupe called Cover Girls Abroad that entertained troops in the South Pacific.         Author of a Dozen Books         Tall, blond and with blue eyes, she gave beauty advice to women in more than a dozen books, including ''Make Your Name in Modeling and Television,'' ''Finishing Touches,'' ''Look Your Best,'' ''Between Us Girls'' and ''Candy Jones' Complete Book of Beauty and Fashion.'' Graduates of her school included Julia Meade and Sandra Dee.         In radio and television, Miss Jones was the hostess of several daytime talk and interview programs and took part in commercials as a performer, teacher and consultant. She also judged and advised beauty pageants and fashion shows around the country and lectured at colleges.         Before her marriage to Mr. Nebel, Miss Jones was married to Harry S. Conover, a model agency chief. The marriage ended in divorce.         Surviving are two sons, Harry Conover of Sudbury, Mass., and Carey Conover of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

She was also a member of the State Department's Advisory Committee on Africa.         She was on the board of overseers of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School for Social Research, a board member for the Foundation for Citizen Education and a life trustee of International House.         Mrs. Ruebhausen is survived by her husband, Oscar; a twin brother, Robert M. Peet of Hanover, N.H., and a sister, Sarah Lewis of Philadelphia.       
        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President

Louella Luhrman, an Army nurse in World War I who became the nation's oldest veteran, died Friday. She was 108 years old.         Miss Luhrman, who joined the Army in 1918, when she was 36, spent her military service at Camp Lewis, Wash., and was discharged in 1919.         She was born in Germany on Dec. 8, 1881, and immigrated to the United States with her family two years later, crossing the Atlantic in a sailing ship.         Miss Luhrman became the nation's oldest veteran in 1987 when Jasper Garrison of Illinois, who had served in the Spanish-American War, died at the age of 107.       
        Nancy Gruver, one of the nation's leading contract bridge players, died of a heart attack Sunday at Howard County General Hospital in Maryland. She was 58 years old and lived in Ellicott City, Md.         Nancy Gruver, one of the nation's leading contract bridge players, died of a heart attack Sunday at Howard County General Hospital in Maryland. She was 58 years old and lived in Ellicott City, Md.         Mrs. Gruver twice came close to winning a world title. In 1966 in Amsterdam, playing with Sue Sachs of Baltimore, she finished second in the World Women's Pair Championship.         In recent years her regular partner has been Edith Kemp Freilich. They were part of an American squad that finished second in the World Women's Team Championship in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1981.         In national championships she won the women's teams competition seven times and the women's pairs five times. She won the mixed pairs and master mixed teams events once each.         Mrs. Gruver, a bridge administrator, served as a member of the National Laws Commission of the American Contract Bridge League and as co-chairman of the national appeals committee, ruling on tournament disputes.         She is survived by her husband, John A. Gruver; a daughter, Cynthia Gruver-Williams of Carroll County, Md., and a son, John Gordon Gruver of College Park, Md.

        Margaret Craske, a leading ballet teacher in England and the United States, died on Sunday at Grand Strand General Hospital in Myrtle Beach, S.C. She was 97 years old.  A pupil of Enrico Cecchetti, the great Italian ballet pedagogue, Miss Craske danced for a short time with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and toured with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, in a small group that performed in English variety theaters during the 1920's.         Margaret Craske, a leading ballet teacher in England and the United States, died on Sunday at Grand Strand General Hospital in Myrtle Beach, S.C. She was 97 years old.  A pupil of Enrico Cecchetti, the great Italian ballet pedagogue, Miss Craske danced for a short time with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and toured with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, in a small group that performed in English variety theaters during the 1920's. She had her own studio in London, where she was ballet mistress for the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet and conducted examinations for the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. She left for New York when, at the suggestion of the choreographer Antony Tudor, American Ballet Theater invited her to become the company's ballet mistress and teacher in 1946.         When Ballet Theater and the Metropolitan Opera House collaborated to open a school at the Metropolitan in 1950, she remained there to teach. It later became the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, and Miss Craske became its director during her nearly-20-year association with the school. She left in 1968 to become ballet mistress of the Manhattan Festival Ballet. She also taught at Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Dance, and for many summers at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. She continued to teach at Manhattan School into her 90's. Among her students were Melissa Hayden, Hugh Laing, Nora Kaye, Carmen Mathe, Paul Taylor and Sallie Wilson.         Injury Ended Performing         Miss Craske was born in Norfolk, England. She began her professional career dancing in music halls. Serge Diaghilev chose her for his company in 1920 after seeing her in a class taught by Cecchetti. When a serious foot injury forced her to stop performing, Cecchetti asked her to help him teach at his London studio. In 1931, she set off for India to study with Meher Baba, an Indian guru. She remained with him for seven years and continued as a disciple for the rest of her life.         An austere, private woman with a sense of humor, Miss Craske was an extremely popular teacher who was known for the consistency and clarity of classes in which she would sometimes spend hours on a single step. ''She was a tiny woman - maybe all of five feet tall - with little feet in pink ballet slippers,'' a student, Nancy Reed, told Klasina VanderWerse for a 1983 feature on Miss Craske in Ballet News. ''She'd wear bell-bottomed trousers to teach in, and her feet would dart out of the trousers like hummingbirds, the pants flapping.''         Like Cecchetti, Miss Craske stressed exact technique and attention to detail in her teaching, emphasizing balance and encouraging her students to pay attention to the quality of movement and the anatomical and physiological workings of the body.         Friendly Competitiveness         Miss Craske was thought by many to have influenced Tudor's choreographic style, though she herself dismissed the notion. She and Tudor ''nipped'' at each other's teaching, as one student put it, as colleagues at the Metropolitan, with Tudor sometimes teaching students wild variations on the strict steps and gestures she had taught them the day before.         Like Tudor, however, she believed that movement must ''mean something,'' as she put it. ''There is no room in the world for dancers running around and around the stage and then kicking their right ear,'' she said in a 1983 interview. ''That doesn't mean a thing.''         Miss Craske retired from teaching in 1986, moving to Myrtle Beach, where she had served as a director of the Meher Spiritual Center for 11 years.         She was the author of two standard references on the Cecchetti technique: ''The Theory and Practice of Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with C. W. Beaumont in 1950, and ''The Theory and Practice of Advanced Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with Derra de Moroda in 1956. She also wrote ''The Dance of Love,'' published in 1980, and the recent ''Still Dancing with Love,'' a journal of her work with Meher Baba.       
        D. Veola Lederer, a former executive of a Manhattan leather boutique and a former museum vice president, died of a heart attack on Wednesday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., while spending the winter in Pompano Beach. She was 81 years old and lived in Stockbridge. Mass.  Mrs. Lederer was the widow of Ludwig G.         D. Veola Lederer, a former executive of a Manhattan leather boutique and a former museum vice president, died of a heart attack on Wednesday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., while spending the winter in Pompano Beach. She was 81 years old and lived in Stockbridge. Mass.  Mrs. Lederer was the widow of Ludwig G. Lederer. In World War II, while her husband taught celestial navigation to pilots in Mississippi, she managed his Fifth Avenue leather goods store, Lederer de Paris. The store was later sold. Mr. Lederer died in 1960.         Mrs. Lederer was a board member and president of Young Audiences Inc., which presents classical music programs for schoolchildren. She was also a volunteer with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was a volunteer, a board member and vice president of Hancock Shaker Community, a nonprofit museum in Pittsfield, Mass.         She was a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music and studied harp and voice for two years in Salzburg and Vienna.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Miss Simon's 10 travel works included the landmark - and best-selling - ''New York Places and Pleasures: An Uncommon Guidebook,'' which has undergone four revisions since 1959, and parallel studies of Mexico City, Paris, London and Rome. Among other guidebooks are ''Italy: The Places in Between'' (1970 and 1984), ''England's Green and Pleasant Land'' (1974), ''Fifth Avenue: A Very Social History'' (1978) and ''A Renaissance Tapestry: The Gonzaga of Mantua'' (1988).         Telling Her Own Story         Autobiographies by the soft-spoken, cosmopolitan writer are ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood'' (1982) and ''A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence'' (1986). Her brother, Michael Grobsmith, said yesterday that Miss Simon recently completed and sent to Harper & Row the manuscript of a third volume, tentatively titled ''Etchings on an Hour Glass,'' ranging from her college years through two marriages and career to her latest travels.         Sybil S. Steinberg described Miss Simon's travel books in ''Publishers Weekly'' as being ''in a class by themselves, distinctly personal guides of rare good taste and discernment.'' J. H. Plumb, in The New York Times Book Review, called her work ''incomparable'' in making ''one of the dullest forms of literature a brilliant work of art.''         Kate Simon, whose given name was Kaila Grobsmith, was born in a Warsaw ghetto on Dec. 5, 1912, came to this country with her family by steerage at the age of 4 and grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx. In ''Bronx Primitive,'' she recalled vividly and unsentimentally her early years, her father, a tyrannical shoemaker, and her mother, who believed deeply in learning and in earning her own living before she married.         Exploring Her Adolescence         In ''A Wider World,'' Miss Simon recounted her rebellious adolescence, which helped get her into the challenging James Monroe High School, where she excelled; becoming a live-in baby sitter for an eccentric, radical family, and tentative, humorous and grim aspects of youthful sexuality. Robert Pinskey, in The New York Times Book Review, lauded her ''clean and unpretentious prose style, her aristocratic disdain for cant and her frank worldiness.''         She earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter College, held various editorial posts, mostly rewriting, and reviewed books for The New Republic and The Nation until she began writing travel guides. She won awards from the National Book Critics Circle, the English Speaking Union and Hunter College, where, her brother said, she was to begin teaching a writing course today.         Asked in 1986 by ''Contemporary Authors'' to advise travelers on how best to enjoy a trip, she replied: ''Go slow. If you have the time for eight countries, take five. If you're rushed to take five, take three.'' She also suggested regular eavesdropping on conversations in cafes, buses and trains and emphasized, ''Walk slowly, look, listen, smell.''         She had been married to Dr. Stanley Goldman, who died in 1942. They had a daughter, Alexandra, who died in 1954. Miss Simon was also married to Robert Simon, a publisher, until their divorce in 1960.         Survivors, besides her brother, who is a public health officer for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, include nieces and a nephew.         A memorial service is to be scheduled soon in Manhattan.       
        Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Greneker was also an architect, contractor, bricklayer and corporation president. She received her architectural and building experience when she drew plans for and built four large stone houses and several small ones in Mount Kisco, N.Y.         Married to Claude P. Greneker, who was for many years publicity director for the Shubert theater interests, she became interested in mannequins when her husband wanted to use some in a theater stunt. To Mrs. Greneker's astonishment, she found that most mannequins were virtual statues and, in 1937, decided to make her own.         She began by forming heads and hands of cellophane and moved on to papier-mache, developing the flexible waist and adding mobility to the mannequins manufactured by the Greneker Corporation. She became president of the company.         The mannequins had carpenter-made joints and rubber ribs, for pliable body parts; horsehair wigs, and theatrical makeup. They appeared in the windows of Fifth Avenue stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.         Mrs. Greneker also created a series of thimble tools - paintbrushes, pencils, screwdrivers and the like - that could be attached to fingertips. They did not catch on.         In World War II, her factory in Pleasantville, N.Y., turned to military work. At the request of the United States Rubber Company, she invented and manufactured forms for self-sealing gasoline tanks for Navy warplanes.         After the war she turned to portrait sculpture, and her heads of actresses were widely exhibited.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Grace O'Brien O'Neill, a child psychologist who developed innovative programs for the New York City Department of Health in the 1950's, died of cardiac arrest on Feb. 15 at Reston Hospital in Virginia. She was 87 years old and had lived in Leonia, N.J., for 60 years.         Grace O'Brien O'Neill, a child psychologist who developed innovative programs for the New York City Department of Health in the 1950's, died of cardiac arrest on Feb. 15 at Reston Hospital in Virginia. She was 87 years old and had lived in Leonia, N.J., for 60 years.         Mrs. O'Neill, working for the Health Department, was a pioneer in ''well baby'' treatment, in which pediatricians monitor the development of healthy children. She later became director of the World Federation of Mental Health.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology from the University of Minnesota. At the Cleveland Child Guidance Institute, which she joined after leaving the university, she made studies that led to acceptance in the United States of the psychological test created by Hermann Rorschach in Switzerland in 1921.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Reston; two daughters, Sheila, of Westport, Conn., and Mona Sharkey of Elverson, Pa.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
        Charlotte M. Sitterly, an astrophysicist whose analysis of sunlight first showed that the element technitium exists in nature, died of heart failure on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91. Dr. Sitterly had devoted much of her career to the study of the sun's spectrum, including wavelengths that could not penetrate the atmosphere and were therefore observed from rockets.         Charlotte M. Sitterly, an astrophysicist whose analysis of sunlight first showed that the element technitium exists in nature, died of heart failure on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91. Dr. Sitterly had devoted much of her career to the study of the sun's spectrum, including wavelengths that could not penetrate the atmosphere and were therefore observed from rockets.         Her principal affiliations were with Princeton University, the National Bureau of Standards, the University of California at Berkeley and the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. She supervised compilation of the multivolume tables of atomic energy levels, as shown by optical spectra, that became a standard reference in laboratories around the world.         She was born Charlotte Emma Moore in Ercildoun, Pa., and was educated at Swarthmore College, where she majored in mathematics and astronomy, graduating in 1920. At Princeton University she worked under Henry Norris Russell, whose classification of stars by brightness and spectral type became standard throughout the world.         In 1925 she began studying the solar spectrum at the Mount Wilson Observatory. She obtained a doctorate in 1931 from the University of California at Berkeley, writing a thesis on the spectra of sunspots. She was appointed to the staff of the Princeton University Observatory. In 1937 she married Dr. Bancroft Walker Sitterly, whom she met there. He is now deceased.         In that year Emilio Segre and his colleagues in Palermo, Italy, identified a substance produced by a particle accelerator at Berkeley as the element predicted to fill a tantalizing gap in the table of elements. From the Greek word for artificial they called it technitium. While all forms, or isotopes, of technitium decay radioactively, that one, technitium 99, lasts thousands of years, allowing the discoverers time to confirm its identity.         Dr. Sitterly then found technitium in the spectrum of sunlight - the first indication that it exists in nature. It has now been found in the light from other stars and is one of the most common products of atom-splitting in nuclear reactors.         In 1945 Dr. Sitterly moved to the National Bureau of Standards in the Department of Commerce to supervise preparation of the now widely used tables of atomic energy levels. In 1961 she was among the first six recipients of the newly created Federal Women's Award for outstanding Government service.         She is survived by several nephews and nieces.       
        Dorothy Spence Illson, a retired editor at Life and Fortune magazines, died of cancer on Tuesday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital Medical Center. She was 70 years old and lived in New Rochelle.         Dorothy Spence Illson, a retired editor at Life and Fortune magazines, died of cancer on Tuesday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital Medical Center. She was 70 years old and lived in New Rochelle.         Mrs. Illson joined Life magazine in 1947 and became chief of the copy room in 1972. She moved to Fortune magazine the next year, where she was instrumental in its conversion to electronic typesetting and publication every two weeks in 1978. She retired in 1986.         She was a graduate of Simpson College. She served with the Red Cross in the Pacific in World War II, and was a copy editor for Dance magazine before joining Life.         She is survived by her husband, Murray, a former reporter for The New York Times; three sons, Richard, of Lakewood, Ohio, James, of Seattle, and John, of Lakewood, Colo., and a brother, Dexter Spence of Roswell, Ga.       
        Leslee Reis, a restaurateur credited with bringing cosmopolitan dining to the Middle West, died of a heart attack on Sunday while on vacation in New Orleans. She was 47 years old and lived in Evanston, Ill.         Leslee Reis, a restaurateur credited with bringing cosmopolitan dining to the Middle West, died of a heart attack on Sunday while on vacation in New Orleans. She was 47 years old and lived in Evanston, Ill.         She suffered from diabetes and had recently developed kidney disease.         Ms. Reis was born in Chicago, grew up in Cincinnati and graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1964 with a degree in biochemistry. While doing graduate work at Harvard University, she fell into what would be her lifelong passion: imaginative, lusty French cooking. She apprenticed herself to Julia Child and washed dishes for Mrs. Child's cooking classes in the Boston area. Eventually, Ms. Reis studied cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris.         In 1966 she and her husband, Andrew Reis, moved to Evanston, where Ms. Reis began a catering business. Eleven years later she opened Cafe Provencale, a country-style French restaurant with a partner, Lizann Bradshaw. Ms. Reis's cooking, her vast knowledge and flamboyant way with fine food and wine, her independent spirit and her table-side comedienne appearances earned Cafe Provencale a devoted following in the Chicago suburb.         ''She was a jolly, lively, good person and a wonderful chef,'' Mrs. Child said yesterday. ''She showed the world that you didn't have to be a man to be a great cook, and she was so generous in advancing women in the restaurant business.''         Ms. Reis earned 11 Critics' Choice Awards from Chicago magazine. She was a founding member of both the American Institute of Wine and Food and the Chicago branch of Les Dames d'Escoffier, a culinary group. In 1987 she was included in the Who's Who of Cooking in America, compiled by Cook's Magazine. The following year Cafe Provencale was named the fifth best dining spot in America by the Zagat Survey.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Winthrop, of Novato, Calif., and Elliot, of Evanston, and her mother, Shirley Tauber of Bellbrook, Ohio.       
        Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Ms. Capitman, who had lived in Miami since 1973, applied her talents to arouse renewed interest in 1920's and 1930's buildings throughout the country. Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building are among the best examples of Art Deco.         ''My whole life had been Art Deco,'' she once said. ''I was born at the beginning of the period and grew up during the height of it. It's a thing of fate.''         Headed a Preservation League         In 1976 she helped to found the Miami Design Preservation League, which in 1979 won Federal historic designation for the South Beach district of Miami Beach. Her outspoken, unorthodox manner later led to her ouster from the group.         ''She would push and agitate and cause trouble until people wouldn't speak to her,'' said Michael Kinerk, chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival. ''She was interested in results, not social sensitivities.''         The South Beach district is now on the National Register of Historic Places, the only 20th-century district on the register. That status brought Federal tax relief to what had been a depressed area. It is now enjoying an economic and cultural rebirth.         Chapters in Other Towns         Mrs. Capitman, president of the Art Deco Society of America, helped found chapters of the society in several cities, including New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. She was the author of ''Deco Delights'' (1989; E. P. Dutton).         She was born in Chicago and attended New York University. She later wrote advertising copy and was a reporter for The Atlantic City Daily World, which has ceased publication.         Her husband, William Capitman, died in 1975. He was a market researcher and economist and in later years a teacher at Florida International University.         Mrs. Capitman leaves two sons, Andrew W., who lives in London, and John A., who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
        Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan.         Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers. In the faintly discernible accent of her native Hungary, she was fond of joking, though without affectation, ''Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.''         Everyone from the president of the library to her assistants called Dr. Szladits by her first name. She, in turn, was on a first-name basis with her precious manuscripts. When she spoke of ''Tom,'' she meant T. S. Eliot, of ''Wystan,'' W. H. Auden, and of ''Virginia,'' her greatly admired diarist and novelist, Virginia Woolf.         Sitting in her cramped office off the Berg's reading and exhibition rooms on the third floor of the library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, Dr. Szladits liked to reach for the exact quotation from one of the tens of thousands of documents in the collection.         'We Protect the Written Word'         Last year, when she mounted a show on diarists, it included 50 of her famous authors, including James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville and, of course, Virginia Woolf, whose manuscripts in 33 volumes are one of the prizes in the Berg. She liked to quote ''Virginia,'' who said, ''Fortunately, intellect has no gender.''         Dr. Szladits considered the Berg not a musty repository of the past but a working collection that was used by biographers from all over the world.         ''We protect the written word at the Berg,'' she told Whitney Balliett, who wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker on Dec. 31, 1984 - the first such article about a librarian in the magazine's history. ''It is a research collection, not a museum. It has to be used. It is alive. My role at the Berg is to stand still and allow the collection to grow. In fact, I try to make time itself stand still here. I try to create quiet and the timelessness that allows for the pursuit of truth.''         Auden's Handwritten Notebooks         Born in Budapest, she immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. After receiving her doctorate in Hungary, she did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris, University College in London and Columbia University. She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.         Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's handwritten notebooks. She also established or expanded files on Conrad Aiken, H. G. Wells, Muriel Rukeyser, Evelyn Waugh, Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, May Sarton, Washington Irving, Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.         ''I am buying in eternity,'' Dr. Szladits once remarked.         Paul Fasana, the library's Andrew W. Mellon Director of Research Libraries, said yesterday: ''Lola was an original. Her standards, for herself and others, were high and at times unattainable. Her dedication to the ideal of literary scholarship was fierce. But she was also loving and human.''         Dr. Szladits was married to Charles Szladits, a professor of law at Columbia University, who died in 1986.         A memorial service will be held on May 5 in the Celeste Bartos Forum of the library, and a book fund in her name will be established for the Berg Collection.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''

        Evelyn K. Hill, who operated souvenir and food concessions at the Statue of Liberty for more than half a century, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers. She was 88 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Evelyn K. Hill, who operated souvenir and food concessions at the Statue of Liberty for more than half a century, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers. She was 88 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Hill was born in Warsaw and came to New York as a teen-ager. There, she met and married Aaron G. Hill, a soldier who shortly after the end of World War I was stationed at Fort Wood, an Army post at the foot of the Statue of Liberty on what was then called Bedloes Island in New York Harbor.         When her husband was discharged, the couple obtained a concession to sell trinkets to visitors. They lived in one of several dozen brick and clapboard Army houses clustered on the island, and sent their children to school on Governors Island by boat.         In 1934, when the Department of the Interior took over what is now called Liberty Island, the several dozen houses were demolished and the Hill family moved to the Bronx.         Tourists From Around the World         Mrs. Hill's daughter, Charlotte Libauer, recalled yesterday that her parents commuted seven days a week by subway and boat to operate their souvenir and food stands. Mrs. Hill became conversant in several languages as she dealt with tourists from around the world.         Her husband died in 1943, but Mrs. Hill continued to operate the concessions and similar ones at Sagamore Hill, the Theodore Roosevelt estate in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Fort McKinley in Baltimore, which, like the Statue of Liberty, are administered by the National Park Service.         Until her final illness, Mrs. Hill was driven twice a week to Liberty Island to visit her concessions.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Baltimore, Mrs. Hill is survived by a son, James, of Manhasset, L.I.; two brothers, Jack and Ralph, both of Baltimore; four grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
        Gerte Willner, a retired New York City ophthalmologist, died of a respiratory ailment on Sunday in Booth Memorial Hospital in Queens. She was 95 years old and lived in Queens.         Gerte Willner, a retired New York City ophthalmologist, died of a respiratory ailment on Sunday in Booth Memorial Hospital in Queens. She was 95 years old and lived in Queens.         Dr. Willner had been an ophthalmologist with the New York City Health Department from 1955 to the late 1970's, when she retired. She also maintained a private practice in Manhattan.         She was born in Krefeld, Germany, and received her medical training in Berlin. With the rise of fascism, she left Germany for London in 1937. She moved to the United States in 1945 after working in British hospitals throughout World War II.         Dr. Willner is survived by a brother, Walter L., of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
        Carolyn Wolsey Ferriday, a philanthropist who helped to bring some Polish women who had been used by the Nazis for medical experiments, to the United States for treatment, died Tuesday at her home in Bethlehem, Conn., after a long illness. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan and at Bellamy House in         Carolyn Wolsey Ferriday, a philanthropist who helped to bring some Polish women who had been used by the Nazis for medical experiments, to the United States for treatment, died Tuesday at her home in Bethlehem, Conn., after a long illness. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan and at Bellamy House in Bethlehem, an historic landmark.         Miss Ferriday, who began her career as an actress in the 1920's and later turned to philanthropy, was a staunch supporter of the French Resistance during World War II. She was a member of France Forever and was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government for her work.         In the 1950's, with the aid of Norman Cousins of Saturday Review magazine and others, she helped to bring a number of Polish survivors of Nazi medical experiments to this country for treatment.         The women were known as ''lapins,'' or rabbits, and had been inmates at the Ravensbruck concentration camp near Berlin in World War II.         The women had been separated into three groups. Some went to decompression chambers for testing human limits to high altitudes; others were immersed in tubs of ice water for testing human limits to low temperature and the third group was sent to operating rooms for bone extractions and the insertion of infectious materials to test new sulfanilamide drugs.         Miss Ferriday also worked to obtain financial compensation for them from the West German Government.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Bella Spewack, co-author with her late husband, Samuel, of a string of wacky comedies for Broadway and film - including such hits as ''Boy Meets Girl'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Kiss Me, Kate'' - died Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         Bella Spewack, co-author with her late husband, Samuel, of a string of wacky comedies for Broadway and film - including such hits as ''Boy Meets Girl'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Kiss Me, Kate'' - died Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         ''She was an original,'' said Lois Elias, a friend of Mrs. Spewack for 30 years. Mrs. Spewack had no survivors. Her husband died in 1971.  ''She never thought like other people,'' Mrs. Elias said. ''She was witty, sharp, but with a quixotic approach to life, a great concern for others.'' At the same time, Mrs. Elias added, ''She was a very good businesswoman; the one who made all the arrangements for the productions.''         Mrs. Spewack, whose maiden name was Bella Cohen, was born in the Transylvania region of what is now Romania, and brought to the United States as an infant.         Radical, Pacifist Views         Growing up on the East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Spewack graduated from Washington Irving High School in 1917. She soon went job hunting, but was turned down time after time as she sought any job available, preferably at a newspaper.         Eventually, the Yorkville Home News hired her as a writer and, soon after, her radical, pacifist views brought her to The New York Call, a socialist newspaper.         Her work apparently caught the attention of Samuel Spewack, then a young reporter for The World. ''Sam really fell in love with my writing,'' Mrs. Spewack said at the time of her husband's death. The Spewacks were married in 1922 and, after spending several years together as correspondents in Moscow, they launched a writing collaboration that eventually spanned four decades.         Their comedy was almost always madcap, verging on slapstick and knock-about farce. It was often peopled by the harassed, the rattle-brained, the blunder-prone and the pompous, among other cartoon-like characters.         Names Up in Lights         Almost every other year, from the 1930's through the 1950's, the names of Spewack works went up in lights on Broadway: ''Clear All Wires,'' in 1932; ''Spring Song,'' in 1934; ''Boy Meets Girl,'' in 1935; ''Leave It to Me,'' in 1938; ''Two Blind Mice'' and ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' both in 1949, and ''My Three Angels,'' in 1953.         Among the movies written by the Spewacks were ''The Nuisance,'' ''Three Loves Has Nancy,'' ''The Gay Bride,'' ''The Cat and the Fiddle,'' ''Weekend at the Waldorf'' and ''My Favorite Wife.''         ''Clear All Wires,'' based on their experiences as reporters in Moscow, was the Spewacks' first big break on Broadway, premiering in 1932. Six years later, it was turned into a musical under the title, ''Leave It to Me,'' with a score by Cole Porter. The show, which included the song, ''My Heart Belongs to Daddy,'' introduced a new young star to Broadway - Mary Martin.         In ''Boy Meets Girl,'' which opened in New York on Nov. 27, 1935, and ran for 669 performances, the Spewacks wrote about a fictional writing team, Benson and Law. The script included an exchange that has slipped into common usage.         'Boy Meets Girl'         ''Listen,'' Benson says. ''I've been writing stories for 11 years. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl.''         ''Kiss Me Kate,'' a takeoff of Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' with a score by Mr. Porter, ran for 1,077 performances in New York and won a Tony Award, as well as a Page One Award, for the Spewacks in 1949. The critic, Brooks Atkinson, wrote that ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' had ''the best musical comedy book of the year.''         The Spewacks had their share of flops. But, in 1955, on the night after a play called ''Festival'' received a chilly reception from the critics, Mrs. Spewack - a tiny, round woman -fought back. She marched onto the stage during curtain calls and appealed to the audience to go tell their friends if they liked the show.         ''Having a failure isn't such a dreadful thing,'' she told an interviewer. ''But 'Festival' is a good, clean show, and when I heard the audience laughing and applauding, I felt it must be something they wanted.''         Mrs. Spewack then went on a dozen radio and television programs, defending ''Festival.'' And the show was extended, if only for several more weeks.       
        Pauline Frederick, a longtime radio and television news analyst of world affairs, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at Lake Forest (Ill.) Hospital while visiting relatives. She was 84 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.         Pauline Frederick, a longtime radio and television news analyst of world affairs, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at Lake Forest (Ill.) Hospital while visiting relatives. She was 84 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.         Miss Frederick achieved eminence when her field was virtually closed to women. She was NBC's correspondent at the United Nations for 21 years, and earlier covered it for ABC. After retiring from NBC in 1974, she commented on foreign affairs for National Public Radio.         At all three networks, Miss Frederick had her own news programs, and she reported on political conventions, the United Nations and world affairs.         She covered the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, conferences of the Big Four foreign ministers in New York and Paris, and China's entrance into the United Nations. She also reported on the Korean War, wars in the Middle East, efforts by the United Nations to restore peace in the Congo and on the Cuban missile affair.         'I Think News Is News'         Early in her career, Miss Frederick was assigned to cover what were regarded as women's stories.         ''I never believed there was such a thing as 'women's news,' '' she said in 1956. ''I think news is news; that's all. One of my first assignments was covering a forum for women on the topic 'How to Get a Husband.' I don't think I learned anything from it, and I don't think the audience did either.''         Soon afterward, though, came a turning point. In an emergency, she was asked to broadcast a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in New York, and afterward specialized in international affairs and politics. In 1951, ABC's biography of Miss Frederick noted that she ''holds the unique distinction of being the only woman network news analyst and diplomatic correspondent in American radio.''         Miss Frederick was born in Gallitzin, Pa., and grew up in Harrisburg, where she reported for several newspapers while still in high school. She considered law as a career before deciding to pursue journalism.         She majored in political science at American Unversity in Washington, where she received a master's degree in international law.         Despite her opinions on so-called women's news, she hit upon an effective way, given the times, to break into journalism: interviewing the wives of diplomats in Washington. She sold the articles to The Washington Star.         Writing and Radio Interviews         Miss Frederick wrote for the United States Daily, a predecessor of U.S. News and World Report, covering the State, War and Navy Departments. Then she wrote for the North American Newspaper Alliance, also doing occasional radio interviews for NBC before becoming a war correspondent for the newspaper alliance in 1945.         Miss Frederick made her first network broadcast from Washington in 1939, her first overseas broadcast from China in 1945, and her first network television broadcast from the national political conventions in Philadelphia in 1948.         In 1976, she became the first woman to moderate a Presidential debate, between Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.         She was also the first woman to be elected president of the United Nations Correspondents Association. Her many honors included a Paul White Award from the Radio-Television News Directors' Association in 1980 and a George Foster Peabody Award in 1954. In 1975, she was named to the Hall of Fame of Sigma Delta Chi, the journalists' society. She received honorary doctorate degrees in journalism, law and the humanities from 23 colleges and universities.         Miss Frederick was married to Charles Robbins, a former reporter and managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, who died in August. There are no immediate survivors.       
        Cecil Johnson Roberts, a patron of the arts and a colorful liberal in conservative Alabama, died yesterday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., after suffering an embolism. She was 76 years old.         Cecil Johnson Roberts, a patron of the arts and a colorful liberal in conservative Alabama, died yesterday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., after suffering an embolism. She was 76 years old.         Mrs. Roberts, a transplanted Englishwoman married to a member of one of the city's leading families, became the cultural leader of Birmingham after World War II. She revived the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and helped found the the Birmingham Civic Theater, which later became the University of Alabama-Birmingham Town and Gown Theater. She was the president for the theater for 30 years.         In the mid-1960's she helped integrate the audience for the performing arts in Alabama when she and her husband escorted the city's most visible civil rights leader, Dr. John Nixon, and his wife, Ethel, down the aisle before a performance at the Municipal Auditorium.         Mrs. Roberts and a friend, James Hatcher, founded the Alabama State Council on the Arts and Humanities in 1966, and she won appointment from Gov. George C. Wallace as chairman in 1971.  She took an active interest in Democratic Party politics and advocated voting rights for blacks in Alabama.         She is survived by her husband, David Roberts 3d; two sons, David Roberts 4th and Robin Watson Roberts, both of Birmingham; two brothers, three sisters and two grandchildren.       
        Lucy Boston, a leading writer of children's fiction, died on Friday at her home, the Manor, a 12th-century Norman house at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, England, which provided the inspiration and setting for her influential ''Green Knowe'' books. She was 97 years old.         Lucy Boston, a leading writer of children's fiction, died on Friday at her home, the Manor, a 12th-century Norman house at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, England, which provided the inspiration and setting for her influential ''Green Knowe'' books. She was 97 years old.         The nearly 20 works by Mrs. Boston, who began writing in her 60's, were noted for delicacy and imagination and for extolling nature's virtues. Most were books for juveniles. Her first book, ''The Children of Green Knowe,'' was praised in The New Yorker in 1955 as ''an uncommon tale with a gratifying blend of the eerie, the sinister and the familiar.''         Mrs. Boston, an energetic woman who wrote during the cold months and gardened in the summers on her four-acre estate, suffered two strokes in March, according to her son, Peter, an architect in nearby Cambridge, who illustrated most of her books.         Translated and Televised         The works were widely used in schools, translated into many languages and televised by the BBC. ''The Children of Green Knowe'' received a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1969, and ''A Stranger at Green Knowe'' earned the Carnegie Medal in Britain in 1962.         The ''stranger'' of the title was an escaped gorilla befriended and hidden by an orphaned Chinese boy. ''The book encapsulates the best qualities of her work,'' said The Times of London, which went on to list ''a crystal-clear style of storytelling, a respect for the innocence and intelligence of the young reader, a serious treatment of supernatural phenomena, a regard for all natural life and a belief that a man-centered conception of the world is false and crippling.''         In 1970, Mrs. Boston described her professional objectives thus: ''To remind adults of joy, now considered obsolete - and to encourage children to use and trust their senses for themselves at first hand - their ears, eyes and noses, their fingers and the soles of their feet, their skins and their breathing, their muscular joy and rhythms and heartbeats, their instinctive loves and pity and their awe of the unknown.''         An Early Foe of Pollution         The former Lucy Maria Wood was born on Dec. 10, 1892, in Southport, Lancashire, into a devout Methodist family. Her father was an engineer. She attended Somerville College at Oxford for a year and left to serve as a nurse in France in World War I. She married Harold Boston, then an officer in the Royal Flying Corps. They settled in Cheshire, where she became an early campaigner against industrial pollution.         The couple were divorced in 1935, and Mrs. Boston studied painting on the Continent until she returned home in early 1939, on the eve of World War II. It was then that she bought the crumbling 12th-century manor, which she soon transformed into one of the oldest habitable homes in England.         Surviving, besides her son, are two granddaughters and two stepgrandsons.       
        Hope Williams, a debutante with a carefree manner, boyishly clipped blond hair and a humorous walk, who was a leading Broadway actress in the late 1920's and 30's, died of cardiac arrest last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Hope Williams, a debutante with a carefree manner, boyishly clipped blond hair and a humorous walk, who was a leading Broadway actress in the late 1920's and 30's, died of cardiac arrest last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Miss Williams, whose sole acting training was in amateur plays, gained notice in a Philip Barry comedy in 1927, ''Paris Bound,'' and won Broadway over as a rebellious socialite in ''Holiday,'' the classic comedy of manners in 1928 that Barry wrote for her.         The enthusiasm of reviewers and audiences was reflected in this appraisal by Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times: ''Miss Williams is one of the most clearheaded comediennes we have. She plays quietly with a sort of comic incandescence that is one of the superlative delights of this season. Through all the turns of the play she remains very much herself - boyishly awkward but quick and sparkling.''         Years later, Katharine Hepburn, who had understudied Miss Williams on Broadway and recreated the ''Holiday'' role in the 1938 movie that also starred Cary Grant, offered this tribute: ''I stole a great deal from Hope. She was the first fascinating personality from that period, 1929 to 1932, which wasn't really ready for her. She was a woman who blossomed with a little more than she was supposed to.''         Well-Bred Foil         Over seven years, Miss Williams was generally hailed in a handful of productions, including two revues, ''The New Yorkers'' and ''Strike Me Pink,'' in which she played a well-bred subtle foil to the riotous buffoonery of Jimmy Durante. She was also remembered for a world-weary role in Noel Coward's 1935 film, ''The Scoundrel.''         Mr. Coward wrote in his 1940 autobiography, ''Future Indefinite,'' that Miss Williams ''had a charming speaking voice with a sort of beguiling tonelessness.''         ''She was slangy without being vulgar,'' Coward added, ''modern without being brash, and her gaucheries of movement had a peculiar grace.''         Miss Williams was born in Manhattan on Aug. 11, 1897. Her father, Waldron, was a prominent lawyer. She attended the Brearley School and Miss Porter's Classes and learned acting in the Amateur Comedy Club and Junior League charity shows.         ''Too much has been made of this Park Avenue situation,'' she told an interviewer. ''What difference does it make what side of the railroad tracks a girl comes from, so long as she has charm and looks and ability?''         Effect of World War II         Miss Williams retired from acting after playing the careless governess Miss Prism in a 1939 Broadway revival of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Earnest.''         Miss Williams told a columnist for Playbill, Rebecca Morehouse, that when When World War II began ''everything changed.''         ''I have a ranch in Wyoming, and after my manager was drafted, I had to be there,'' Miss Williams said.         She divided her time between the 1,000-acre dude ranch outside Cody and her Upper East Side apartment and for a while ran a cooking school and recorded books for the blind.         Mrs. Morehouse observed in her column in 1983 that in later decades Miss Williams socialized in Manhattan almost without notice, often attended theater and music events and regularly dined with friends, often at her club, the Colony. Asked why she never resumed acting, she thought for a moment, smiled nonchalantly and replied, ''I guess that's because I have always had a privileged life.''         Some of the privileges came from her former husband, Dr. R. Bartow Read. They were married in 1922 and divorced in 1928. He was killed in a crash of his private plane in 1931, and his will, written in 1923, named her as his sole beneficiary.         Survivors include two nephews and five nieces.       
        Patricia Dunn, a dancer who was one of the original members of Jerome Robbins's Ballets U.S.A., died of lung cancer on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 years old.         Patricia Dunn, a dancer who was one of the original members of Jerome Robbins's Ballets U.S.A., died of lung cancer on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 years old.         Mr. Robbins described Miss Dunn yesterday as a ''very, very special dancer,'' adding that she had been outstanding earlier in choreography by Jack Cole, considered the major pioneer of jazz dance in musicals.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Dunn grew up and studied dance in San Francisco. She made her debut with the San Francisco Ballet in 1948. In 1950 she appeared in ''Of All Things,'' a Los Angeles revue choreographed by Eugene Loring. That same year she toured with the Jack Cole Dance Group - a company that also included Gwen Verdon - and appeared with it in the movie ''On the Riviera.'' She danced for Mr. Cole on Broadway in such musicals as ''Kismet'' (1953), ''Jamaica'' (1957) and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' (1963). She also appeared in the film version of ''Kismet.''         Miss Dunn joined Ballets U.S.A., Mr. Robbins's touring company, at its inception in 1958, when it appeared at the Spoleto Festival in Italy and the World's Fair in Brussels. Remaining with it until it disbanded three years later, she created roles in such major Robbins ballets as ''New York Export: Opus Jazz'' and ''The Concert.''         She is survived by her husband, Ronald J. Lehrman.         A service is to be held on Wednesday at 6:30 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, near 81st Street.       
        Ruth M. Martin, a nurse who served in American embassies in Europe, Africa and Asia and who was later in charge of the international program of the American Nurses Association, died of pneumonia last Saturday in the Village Nursing Home in Greenwich Village. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ruth M. Martin, a nurse who served in American embassies in Europe, Africa and Asia and who was later in charge of the international program of the American Nurses Association, died of pneumonia last Saturday in the Village Nursing Home in Greenwich Village. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Martin, who was born in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and received her nurse's training in Washington, was one of 15 American nurses who were rescued in the torpedoing of the Dutch liner Maasdam by a German submarine in the North Atlantic in June 1941.         The nurses, and two others who were lost in the sinking, were on their way to serve in London under the auspices of the American Red Cross and the Harvard Medical School in the months before the United States entered World War II.         The ship was abandoned north of Iceland on a rainy night. Miss Martin was among those who were rescued by a Norwegian tanker after drifting for seven days in a lifeboat.         Later in the war she served in the American Embassy in London, and after the war she was assigned to embassies in Cairo and Teheran. She represented the Pathfinder Fund, an organization promoting birth control, in South America and in Africa before returning to the United States and the Nurses Association post. She retired in 1972.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Evangeline Johnson Merrill, a prominent figure in the arts who was the last surviving child of Robert Wood Johnson, co-founder of Johnson & Johnson, died yesterday at Bryan Health Care Center in Hendersonville, N.C. She was 93 years old and lived at World's Edge Apple Organic Farm in Hendersonville.         Evangeline Johnson Merrill, a prominent figure in the arts who was the last surviving child of Robert Wood Johnson, co-founder of Johnson & Johnson, died yesterday at Bryan Health Care Center in Hendersonville, N.C. She was 93 years old and lived at World's Edge Apple Organic Farm in Hendersonville.         A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said Mrs. Merrill's death resulted from injuries suffered in a fall earlier this year.         She was born in 1897 in New Brunswick, N.J., to Robert Wood Johnson and Evangeline Brewster Armstrong. Her brothers were Gen. Robert Wood Johnson, who built the family-owned business into a large, diversified health care company, and J. Seward Johnson, whose will was the subject of prolonged litigation in Manhattan.         After her graduation from Miss Spence's School in Manhattan in 1916, she became an instructor in first aid and then a lieutenant in the city's Red Cross Ambulance Corps. She was decorated by President Woodrow Wilson for her services in the Red Cross in World War I.         A One-Woman War         In the early 1920's she waged a one-woman war against the city government in Palm Beach, Fla., which refused to allow the wearing of new abbreviated women's bathing suits in public. She had a large number of handbills printed in protest and flew over the beach tossing them from the cockpit of a plane she had recently learned to fly.         Her first husband was the conductor Leopold Stokowski, from whom she was divorced in 1938. She later married Prince Zalstem-Zalessky, a nobleman of Russian descent who died in 1965.         In 1975 she married Charles Merrill. Before moving to North Carolina, the couple lived in Dublin, where they produced a quarterly magazine, The Arts in Ireland.         In 1943, she was made a Fellow in Perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was a patron of several museums, including the Peabody Museum of Yale University. She was a chairwoman of the speakers' bureau of the League of Nations.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Merrill is survived by two daughters, Lyuba Rhodes of Geneva and Dr. Sadja Greenwood of San Francisco, and five grandchildren.       
        Grace Holmes Barbey, a consultant to the United Nations Children's Fund since its inception in 1947, died of a heart attack on Friday at New York Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Paradise Valley, Ariz.         Grace Holmes Barbey, a consultant to the United Nations Children's Fund since its inception in 1947, died of a heart attack on Friday at New York Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Paradise Valley, Ariz.         Mrs. Barbey, who was attending a conference here when she was stricken, served as a liaison between UNICEF and member nations. She traveled around the world seven times on the organization's behalf and represented it at conferences on five continents. She retired from full-time service in 1965 but continued as a consultant until her death.         Her second husband, Jean W. Barbey, died in 1973. She is survived by a brother, Samuel Parzybok of Wichita, Kans., and two sisters, Maurine Spach of Evanston, Ill., and Helen Erickson of San Diego.       
        Dorothy W. Weeks, a physicist whose professional career spanned nearly six decades, died of a stroke on Monday at Newton Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 97 years old and lived in Wellesley, Mass.         Dorothy W. Weeks, a physicist whose professional career spanned nearly six decades, died of a stroke on Monday at Newton Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 97 years old and lived in Wellesley, Mass.         From 1930 to 1956, except for two years in World War II, Dr. Weeks was a professor and head of the physics department at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. For six years after her retirement from Wilson she coordinated a program at the United States Army's arsenal at Watertown, Mass., that developed radiological shielding materials for use against nuclear weapons, neutrons and gamma rays.         Leaving the Army's Materials Research Agency in 1964, she became a spectroscopist, studying solar satellites at the Harvard College Observatory. She retired in 1976 at the age of 83.         Dr. Weeks, a native of Philadelphia and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College, went to work in 1917 as an assistant examiner for the United States Patent Office and, concurrently, an assistant at the National Bureau of Standards. From 1920 to 1924, while studying and teaching physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she earned her master's degree.         In 1924 she began a new, if short-lived, career in retailing. Obtaining a second master's degree, from the Prince School of Business at Simmons College, she became an employment supervisor for Jordan Marsh, the Boston department store.         In 1928 she returned to academic life, teaching physics at Wellesley while earning her Ph.D. in mathematics at M.I.T. in 1930. She was the first woman to earn a mathematics Ph.D. at the university.         From 1943 to 1945, on leave from Wilson College, she was a technical aide at the Federal Government's Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 1949 and 1950, back at Wilson, she was a Guggenheim Fellow.         Dr. Weeks is survived by a sister, Ruth Davis of Washington.       
        Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her stepson, John French Jr., said she had suffered a stroke while visiting relatives in the Philadelphia area.         Mrs. French was born into Philadelphia's Main Line society but spent most of her adult life in New York, where she was active in political causes and civic affairs. Although she had not held party office in the last decade, she remained influential in Democratic affairs until her death.         Last year Mrs. French devoted much of her energy to securing revision of the New York City Charter. As chairwoman of the charter committee of the Women's City Club, she lobbied for the changes that were adopted by the voters last November.         Helped Nazi Victims         Earlier this year the Unitarian Universalist Services Committee honored Mrs. French for her work in the aftermath of World War II, when she directed two rest homes in France operated by the church organization for survivors of Nazi concentration camps.         Mrs. French was most prominently in the public eye in 1964 when she tried unsuccessfully to wrest a seat in the House of Representatives from John V. Lindsay. As the Democratic-Liberal candidate in the ''Silk Stocking'' district on Manhattan's East Side, she waged a vigorous campaign but lost, receiving less than 25 percent of the vote.         Two years earlier she had been appointed New York City's first Commissioner to the United Nations, a post she held until her race for Congress.         Mrs. French was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions, from 1964 through 1980, and was vice chairwoman of the state party from 1957 to 1960.         She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which she found progressive. But at 14, as the president of her class, she complained to the headmistress that because the school was all white she was not being prepared for the world in which she was going to live. She quoted the reply: ''My dear Ellie, we're not giving you the opportunity to make friends with Democrats either.''         A Stint as a Teacher         Mrs. French, who later became a member of the New York City Commission on Intergroup Relations, now the Commission on Human Rights, studied at the Sorbonne and at Harvard and Columbia.         In 1932, after her father, Herbert Lincoln Clark, a stockbroker, lost a fortune in the Depression, she returned to Shipley as a teacher and later became a supervisor at the Episcopal School in Overbrook, Pa.         In World War II she served in the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington. In 1949, after returning from France, she joined the staff of The New York Times and was named women's news editor. She resigned in 1955 to become more active in politics, and the following year she ran for the State Senate but lost. In 1957 she was appointed vice chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee to fill a vacancy, and in 1958 she won election to the post.         But two years later, in a split with the party's top leadership, she was out, charging that she and other women had not been given a real voice in Democratic affairs in the state.         Family members said yesterday that last Thursday Mrs. French had been pleased to stand in line for two hours for the chance to meet Nelson Mandela during his New York visit.         Mrs. French's husband, John, whom she married in 1950, died in 1984. Surviving are two stepsons, John Jr., of Manhattan, and Roberts, of Amherst, Mass., and a stepdaughter, Mary Moore of Cheyenne, Wyo.         A funeral service will be held on Monday at 11 A.M. at All Souls Unitarian Church, Lexington Aveue at 80th Street.

Adele Lewis Corwin, who founded the Career Blazers employment agency in 1949 and headed it until she retired in 1975, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. Mrs. Corwin, who was 67 years old and lived in Hawley, Pa., died of complications from lung cancer, her son, William Lewis, said yesterday.         Mrs. Corwin was the author or co-author of 11 books related to careers, including ''How to Write a Better Resume,'' published in 1975, and ''Fast Track Careers for the Nineties'' (1989).         She was born in Yonkers, and received bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry from Columbia University. She was a chemist with the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, during World War II.         Mrs. Corwin is survived, in addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, by her husband, Eugene; a sister, Charlotte Kassel of Washington, and a grandson.       
        Patricia C. Critchlow, a retired administrative aide with the International Food Policy Research Institute, died Sunday at her home in Newburyport, Mass. She was 64 years old and lived previously in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Patricia C. Critchlow, a retired administrative aide with the International Food Policy Research Institute, died Sunday at her home in Newburyport, Mass. She was 64 years old and lived previously in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Her husband, James, said Mrs. Critchlow died of breast cancer.         She was born in Warren, Pa., and was a graduate of Wellesley College. She lived in West Germany and France for several years before joining the institute, which deals with problems of the third world, in 1976. She retired four years ago as assistant to the director.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Ann Onanian of Merrimack, N.H., and Jane, of Cambridge, Mass., and a granddaughter.       
        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.       
        Berenice Robinson Morris, a composer, teacher and editor, died on Friday in Mount Vernon Hospital. She was 81 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Berenice Robinson Morris, a composer, teacher and editor, died on Friday in Mount Vernon Hospital. She was 81 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Mrs. Morris's son Jeffrey Brandon Morris said she died after a brief illness.         Mrs. Morris studied composition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and the Juilliard Graduate School in New York. Her works include instrumental, chamber, symphonic and choral works, as well as Jewish liturgical music. She taught at Long Island University and was a Fulbright Lecturer in music at the Free University of Berlin in 1969.         The three volumes of her history for children, ''American Popular Music,'' was published between 1970 and 1974. She was music editor of both the ''Encyclopedia of American History'' and ''Harper's Encyclopedia of the Modern World.'' Her late husband, Richard B. Morris, was an American constitutional historian and a former chairman of the history department at Columbia University.         In addition to Mr. Morris, of Philadelphia, she is survived by a son, Donald Robinson Morris of Cheyenne, Wyo.; a brother, Donald Robinson, of New York City, and five grandchildren.       
        Marion Rice Hart, a sportswoman and author who sailed a ketch around the world and in her later years made seven solo flights across the Atlantic, the last at 83 years old, died on Monday. She was 98 years old and lived in Berkeley, Calif. She previously lived in Washington and Manhattan.         Marion Rice Hart, a sportswoman and author who sailed a ketch around the world and in her later years made seven solo flights across the Atlantic, the last at 83 years old, died on Monday. She was 98 years old and lived in Berkeley, Calif. She previously lived in Washington and Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, said her niece, Dorothy Rice.         Mrs. Hart was 54 years old when she learned to fly and was 70 when in 1962 she flew a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza nonstop across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Ireland.         A little fatigued from the 2,500-mile flight, which she made with a navigator, she was reported to have walked into the airport lounge upon her arrival, downed a large glass of whisky and said, ''Now I feel better.''         Flew Alone Until 87         Mrs. Hart subsequently made seven solo flights across the Atlantic and flew all over the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. She flew alone until she was 87, having logged more than 5,000 hours in her three decades as an aviator. In 1976 she received the highly prized annual Harmon International Trophy ''for her consistently outstanding performance as a private pilot operating small aircraft on a global scale.''         Before her flying career, Mrs. Hart had captained a 72-foot ketch around the world, most of the way alone. After the three-year voyage, which ended in 1939, she became a ham radio operator and served in the Army Signal Corps throughout World War II.         She wrote many magazine articles for sports publications, and was the author of three books: ''I Fly As I Please'' (Vanguard, 1953), a humorous account of her adventures in the air; ''How to Navigate Today'' (Cornell Maritime Press, 1940), a celestial guide to navigation now in its sixth edition, and ''Who Called That Lady a Skipper?'' (Vanguard Press, 1938), an account of her navigations around the world.         Mrs. Hart was born in London, the daughter of a corporation lawyer. In 1913 she became the first woman to graduate in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She later received a master's degree in geology from Columbia University.         Her marriage to Arthur Hart, a mining engineer, ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Margaret Lockwood, an actress who became one of the most popular figures in British films of the late 1940's, died on Sunday. She was 73 years old.         Margaret Lockwood, an actress who became one of the most popular figures in British films of the late 1940's, died on Sunday. She was 73 years old.         Miss Lockwood's family would not disclose the cause of death.         She was born in Karachi, Pakistan, on Sept. 15, 1916, and sent to England to be educated. When she was 12 years old, she had her first stage role, as a fairy in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''         She was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and made her first film, ''The Amateur Gentleman,'' when she was 19.         Of Fright and Espionage         Miss Lockwood first came to prominence as the frightened heroine in Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film ''The Lady Vanishes,'' in which she played a young woman who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving an abduction.         Her other notable films include the 1940 ''Night Train,'' directed by Carol Reed, in which she co-starred with Rex Harrison in a tale of World War II espionage; ''The Stars Look Down'' (1941), another Reed film, about a catastrophe in an English mining town; ''The Man in Gray'' (1943), a Regency period melodrama, and the 1945 hit ''The Wicked Lady,'' another period piece in which she played an aristocrat who joins a highwayman (James Mason) in his life of crime.         In 2 TV Series         By 1957, she had acted in more than 40 films. Her last film appearance was in 1976, in a cameo role in ''The Slipper and the Rose.''         She was featured in the popular 1960's British television series ''The Flying Swan,'' co-starring her daughter, Julia Lockwood, and in a series called ''Justice'' in the 1970's.         Her father, a railway clerk in the British colonial service in India, had little contact with her. Her mother disapproved of her first love, Rupert Leon, a London commodities clerk, and they married in secret. They were divorced during World War II.         She is survived by her daughter.       
        Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         She died of complications from a thyroid condition, said Daniel Rosenblatt, a Gestalt therapist in Manhattan who was a close friend.         In the late 1940's and 1950's, Mrs. Perls collaborated with her husband, Fritz Perls, to develop the theory and technique of Gestalt therapy. The therapy is an eclectic blend borrowing from such sources as the work of Freud and Wilhelm Reich, psychodrama, existentialism and a German theory of perception of the 1930's called gestalt.         Fritz Perls, a psychiatrist, was the better-known and more flamboyant of the pair, acting as teacher in residence at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif., during the 1960's heyday of the human potential movement it expounded, and traveling the world to train therapists. He died in 1970.         A Turn to the Present         But among many Gestalt therapists, Laura Perls was seen as the mainstay of the movement, heading the major Gestalt training institute in New York City for almost 40 years, and an unacknowledged contributor to the early books by her husband that formulated the approach.         Gestalt therapy was one of the first psychotherapies to break with the traditional methods of psychoanalysis, which focused on the traumas of early life, and turn the focus on a person's emotions and perceptions at the present.         While the method met with intense opposition and criticism from analysts in its early days, Gestalt therapy is now recognized as a major approach to treating emotional problems, and its methods are widely employed even among therapists of other schools.         Some techniques that Gestalt therapists use derive from theater and movement. For instance, the therapy holds that each element in a patient's dream symbolizes an aspect of the self. In one technique, someone who dreamed about talking to a cigar-smoking conductor on a train might enact being, in turn, the cigar, the conductor and even the train.         Laura Perls, whose given name was Lore Posner, was born in 1905, the daughter of a prosperous merchant, in Pforzheim. She had returned to her birthplace earlier this year to be near her daughter, Renate Perls.         Studied With Theologians         As a student in Germany, Mrs. Perls took courses with the theologians Paul Tillich and Martin Buber and studied the work of the psychologists who had formed a new gestalt school, though not a method of treatment. These psychologists included Kurt Goldstein. A student of movement and dance as well as an accomplished pianist, Mrs. Perls became a psychoanalyst in Germany.         But she shared with her husband a dissatisfaction with Freudian orthodoxy that led them to the innovations that developed into Gestalt therapy. Many of the early developments have been attributed to her, including having the patient sit up and face the therapist rather than lying down as is traditional in psychoanalysis.         Laura and Fritz Perls met as students in Frankfurt and were married in 1930. They left Germany for South Africa in 1933 to escape the rise of fascism. Coming to America in 1948, they settled in New York City, where they founded the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy in 1952. Mrs. Perls headed the institute until recent years.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Perls is survived by a son, Dr. Stephen R. Perls, a psychologist in Albuquerque, N.M.; a brother, Robert Posner, of Providence, R.I.; four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
        Alison Leggatt, an actress who won renown in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter, died on Sunday, her family said today. She was 86 years old.         Alison Leggatt, an actress who won renown in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter, died on Sunday, her family said today. She was 86 years old.         Alison Joy Seetah Leggatt became an actress against the wishes of her well-to-do parents. Her mother refused ever to see her act, considering the stage unsuitable for a well-bred young woman.         Her performance in 1927 in ''The Fanatics'' by Miles Malleson established her as one of the most promising theatrical newcomers of her generation.         During the 1930's, she appeared in Noel Coward's ''Cavalcade,'' playing a honeymooning wife on the Titanic just before it struck the iceberg. She also acted in plays by Clifford Bax and J. B. Priestley.         After World War II, she was Lavinia in T. S. Eliot's ''Cocktail Party'' with Rex Harrison and Margaret Leighton, and Mrs. Guzzard in Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.'' She played the emotionally restrained landlady in ''Epitaph for George Dillon,'' by Mr. Osborne and Anthony Creighton, in London and New York. In the early 1960's she was Flora in Mr. Pinter's ''Slight Ache.''         Although her theater career ended in the late 1960's, she continued to appear on television and had movie roles in ''Far From the Madding Crowd,'' ''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.''

Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and died on Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of death.  She was born Madge McHarg on in Melbourne, Australia. She grew up in London and became a journalist in the 1920's, first working for English Vogue with the novelist Aldous Huxley and the photographer Cecil Beaton, and later freelancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.         She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor in 1933.         During World War II, she became merchandising manager for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store here, and designed some fashion.         In 1948, she founded the first British school of fashion, at the invitation of the Royal College of Art. She remained at its head until 1956.         She produced five books on fashion and the history of costumes.         She was married in the 1920's to Capt. Ewart Garland. In 1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; they were divorced in 1962. She had no children.       
        Mildred Scott Olmsted, a longtime antiwar campaigner who was national executive director of a leading pro-disarmament group, died Monday at her home in Rose Valley, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 99 years old.

For 20 years, starting in 1946, Mrs. Olmsted led the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, formed at The Hague in 1915. She was also active in the women's suffrage movement from the early 1900's, and later in life became active in the civil rights movement.         In 1961 she began a series of exchange seminars between the United States section of the league and the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union, a group sponsored by the Soviet Government.         Two months ago Mrs. Olmsted received a lifetime achievement award from the City of Philadelphia, and in 1986 she received the women's league's Peace and Freedom Award.         She was born in Glenolden, Pa., and graduated from Smith College in 1912. In World War I she was a social worker with the Y.W.C.A. in France and Germany. In France she met Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and first president of the women's league, whose example inspired Mrs. Olmsted to work for peace.

        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.       
        Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         A graduate of the University of Iowa, Dr. Goodykoontz taught at rural schools in Iowa and Wisconsin and at the University of Pittsburgh before being appointed to the No. 2 position in the Bureau of Education, as it was known. She served as Assistant Commissioner from 1929 to 1946, was director of the elementary education division from 1946 to 1949 and was then named Associate Commissioner of Education. In 1951 she became director of comparative education. She was later in charge of international education relations.         Saw Use for 'Talkies'         Dr. Goodykoontz was with the Office of Education, a precursor to a Cabinet department, in the crisis brought on by the Great Depression and later by World War II. In 1932 she advocated use of ''talkies'' in the classroom, writing, ''The sound film appears to be a particularly effective method of instruction for backward children.''         In 1935 she called for an increase in education programs for people mired in the Depression, and early in World War II she advocated day care so mothers could work in arms plants.         She was a member and official of many education organizations and was vice president of the United States National Committee for Childhood Education and of the World Organization for Childhood Education.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Darrow of South Newfane, and three grandchildren.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker in ''Hello, Dolly!'' which she played on Broadway for two years.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Richard M. Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.'

''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job?

Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''

        Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K. Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the         Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K. Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the Czechoslovak capital for more than three decades.         Victor Rabinowitz, a New York lawyer who received word of Mrs. Stern's death, said that although the cause of her death was not reported, she had recently suffered an intestinal blockage.         Martha Dodd came to public attention in 1939 when her first book, ''Through Embassy Eyes,'' was published. It told of her four years in Berlin beginning in 1933 when her father, William E. Dodd, was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Ambassador to Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power.         Then in her 20's, she was at first favorably impressed by the new leaders of Nazi Germany but her later disillusionment was reflected in her book.         In 1938, a year after her return to the United States, she married Mr. Stern, a former chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York who had inherited through an earlier marriage part of the fortune of Julius Rosenwald, the Chicago philanthropist.         In 1941, after her father's death and nine months before the United States entered World War II, Mrs. Stern and her brother, William E. Dodd Jr., published the Ambassador's diaries. Critics said that by failing to edit the comments of Germans who were opposed to Hitler they endangered the anti-Nazi underground.         Subject of McCarthy Investigation         In the last days of the war Mrs. Stern published ''Sowing the Wind,'' a novel that dealt with the moral degradation of Germans under the Nazi hierarchy.         In the early 1950's she and Mr. Stern became persistent targets of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in his anti-Communist investigations. The couple moved to Mexico City in 1953, and four years later Boris Morros, an American counterspy, testified to the House Committee on Un-American Activities that the Sternses were part of a Soviet spy network.         When they were indicted on espionage charges in 1957, the couple fled to Prague, where they settled. They later traveled to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and to Cuba but never returned to the United States. Mrs. Stern did translations of books and articles. Mr. Stern died four years ago at the age of 88.         Mrs. Stern is survived by a son, Robert, who lives in Prague.       
        Tamara Deutscher, a writer and editor who with her husband, the late Isaac Deutscher, researched the leaders of Soviet Communism, died on Tuesday in London, where she lived. She was 77 years old and, according to family friends, had suffered from emphysema.         Tamara Deutscher, a writer and editor who with her husband, the late Isaac Deutscher, researched the leaders of Soviet Communism, died on Tuesday in London, where she lived. She was 77 years old and, according to family friends, had suffered from emphysema.         Mrs. Deutscher, born in Poland, escaped to England at the outbreak of World War II. As Tamara Lebenhaft, she was secretary to an expatriate organization of Polish journalists in London when she and Mr. Deutscher were married in 1947. She collaborated with him on his biographies of Stalin and Trotsky and, after his death in 1967, she edited collections of her husband's writings.         Mrs. Deutscher wrote a study of her own, ''The Other Lenin,'' published in 1973, and later assisted the historian E. H. Carr in preparing the last volumes of his history of the Soviet Union.         She is survived by a son, Martin, of London.       
        Dr. Jane Cary Peck, an educator, author and a vice president of the National Council of Churches, died Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 58 years old and lived in Williamstown, Mass.         A spokesman for the Andover Newton Theological School, where she was a professor of religion, said she had died of cancer.         Dr. Peck was a graduate of Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., and earned her doctorate in social ethics at Boston University. She served on the governing board of the National Council of Churches for the past 12 years as a representative of the United Methodist Church. She participated in international conferences on ecumenical efforts for peace, justice and women's issues. In 1984, Westminster Press published her book ''Self and Family.''         This year, she traveled to Nicaragua for research for the World Council of Churches' study of ''Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation.''         She is survived by her husband, Robert; three sons, Robert of Seattle, James of Wellesley, Mass., and Jonathan of Williamstown; a daughter, Cary, of Williamstown; her mother, Ruth M. Chapman of Forsyth, Ga., and a sister, Ruth W. Hassler of Steinhatchee, Fla.       
        Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Her son, David R. J. Blow, said she had died after suffering a series of strokes this week at the hospital, a geriatric facility that she entered in March. She had lived in various residences for the elderly, mainly in California, since 1983, after residing most of her earlier life in Manhattan.         The versatile Ms. Mannes was a social critic and a critic of radio, television and theater. She worked as a staff writer for the magazine The Reporter from 1952 to 1963. Her writing there included articles, essays and reviews. She even wrote satirical verse, under the pen name ''Sec.''         She did much writing over the years for The New Yorker and for other publications ranging from McCalls to The New York Times, and was the author of several books.         More Than Outspoken         Ms. Mannes's 1958 collection of essays - largely from The Reporter -was contentiously titled ''More in Anger: Some Opinions, Uncensored and Unteleprompted.'' William du Bois, reviewing it in The New York Times, said that ''to call these pages outspoken is putting things mildly.'' The book, he continued, ''is guaranteed to shock you into awareness of its author as an original thinker.''         ''Whether she is writing of the Rheingold girls or the boys in Washington,'' he observed, ''of social-minded mothers and their child victims, of the world of Miltown or the think-room at the United Nations, of the 'half-people' of our automotive age or the heirs of Senator McCarthy, she hews to the line and lets the quips fall where they may.''         For some years, Ms. Mannes was seen often on television, but she was a champion of the written word. In a speech to a gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, she once said, ''No picture on a screen can ever be an adequate substitute for the reporting of a trained observer and an honest writer.''         Marya Mannes was born on Nov. 14, 1904, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her parents were David Mannes and the former Clara Damrosch - founders of the Mannes College of Music.         She grew up in Manhattan, graduating in 1923 from Miss Veltin's School for Girls. Instead of going to college, she went to Europe for two years and studied sculpture, mainly in England.         She went on to do varied writing - including a play, ''Cafe,'' that failed on Broadway in 1930. From 1933 to 1936, she worked for Vogue magazine, as an associate editor and later as feature editor.         Wartime Analyst         During part of World War II, she was an intelligence analyst with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, she did much free-lance writing in addition to her work on The Reporter. Over the decades, 329 articles with her byline were published - 275 of them in The Reporter.         In later years she appeared on various televison programs. The Times television critic Jack Gould wrote in 1961 that ''her sustained acerbity is one of the attractive adornments of contemporary criticism.'' She also lectured across the country.         Her books include ''Out of My Time'' (1971), an autobiography; ''Message From a Stranger'' (1948) and ''They'' (1968) - both novels - and ''Subverse: Rhymes for Our Times'' (1959), a volume of satiric verse.         She was also a co-author of ''Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart'' (1972), a book about divorce. ''The Best of Marya Mannes,'' an anthology of her writing edited by Robert Mottley, was published in 1986.         In 1958 she won the George Polk Memorial Award, one of many honors given for her writing.         Her three marriages - to the set designer Jo Melziener, to Richard A. Blow, an artist, and to Christopher Clarkson, a representative of British companies - ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, who lives in San Francisco.       
        Grace Koehler Breslauer, one of this country's first women aviators, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Breslauer died of cancer, said her son, Walter H. Liebman.         She began flying in the early 1930's and was an original member of the ''Ninety-Nines,'' an organization of the first 100 women pilots. She was a first lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol during World War II and flew missions along the New Jersey coast.         In the late 1940's, to help children of working parents, she organized Citizens for the All-Day Neighborhood Schools in Manhattan.         In 1950 she founded the ''Know-How Workshop'' to teach women how to do basic home maintenance and repair.         Mrs. Breslauer was born in Manhattan and graduated from Allegheny College in 1944.         She is survived by a two children from a former marriage, her son, Walter of Rye, N.Y., and a daughter, Susan Butler of Pine Plains, N.Y.; a brother, Edwin H. Koehler of Manhattan; and a sister, Carol K. Pforzheimer of Stuart, Fla., five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Clara Beyer, an influential New Deal administrator who served as a confidential aide to Frances Perkins during her 12 years as Secretary of Labor, died Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 98 years old.         Clara Beyer, an influential New Deal administrator who served as a confidential aide to Frances Perkins during her 12 years as Secretary of Labor, died Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 98 years old.         A family spokesman said she died of a heart ailment.         A forceful, dynamic woman, Mrs. Beyer became a close friend of Secretary Perkins and Eleanor Roosevelt. She is credited by Esther Peterson, a former Presidential adviser on consumer affairs, with bringing diverse state labor laws under a common Federal umbrella.         Mrs. Beyer began her career as secretary of the Minimum Wage Board for the District of Columbia after World War I. Her job was to assess the wages paid to women in the district so minimum levels could be set.         In 1928 she went to work for the Children's Bureau of the Labor Department. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President, she played a valuable back-room role in the appointment of Secretary Perkins, the first woman ever named to a Cabinet, and in the development of much of the social legislation that marked the New Deal: establishing worker safety, maximum hours, minimum wages and Social Security.         Mrs. Beyer is survived by three sons, Donald of Falls Church, Va., Morton of Lolo, Mont., and Richard of Seattle; 12 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.       
        Fran Smith, director of the Westbury (L.I.) Players, an amateur theater group, for 17 years, died on Wednesday at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. She was 69 years old and lived in Westbury.         Fran Smith, director of the Westbury (L.I.) Players, an amateur theater group, for 17 years, died on Wednesday at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. She was 69 years old and lived in Westbury.         Mrs. Smith died of cancer, said a daughter, Sarah Prounis of Wyckoff, N.J.         Mrs. Smith was active in the Westbury Players until two years ago when illness forced her to retire. She was also a tutor for the Literacy Volunteers of America in Nassau County.         Mrs. Smith had been a transport pilot for the Women's Air Force Service in World War II.         Besides her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Robert D.; two sons, Mark, of Sea Cliff, L.I., and Daniel, of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Leslie Levine of Syosset, L.I.; a sister, Nancy Etting of Madison, Conn., and 10 grandchildren.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria. In the 1950's, she made only occasional television appearances.         As she did less acting, she turned to other pursuits. She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS. ANNA         These are among the more than 40 films made by Irene Dunne during her 22-year film career:         Cimarron (1931)         Ann Vickers (1933)         Roberta (1935)         Magnificent Obsession (1935)         Show Boat (1936)         Theodora Goes Wild (1936)         The Awful Truth (1937)         Love Affair (1939)         My Favorite Wife (1940)         A Guy Named Joe (1943)         The White Cliffs of Dover (1944)         Anna and the King of Siam (1946)         Life With Father (1947)         I Remember Mama (1948)         The Mudlark (1950)       
        Ruth Cheney Streeter, who commanded the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II, died on Sunday at her home in Morristown, N.J., two days before her 95th birthday.         Ruth Cheney Streeter, who commanded the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II, died on Sunday at her home in Morristown, N.J., two days before her 95th birthday.         She died of congestive heart failure, her son Thomas said.         Mrs. Streeter, an energetic civic volunteer before and after the war, earned a commercial pilot's license in 1942 at the age of 46. The next year, she was appointed to head the women Marines.         She retired from the Marines as a colonel at the end of the war and was awarded the Legion of Merit.         When the women Marines were formed, they joined other female reserve service arms like the WAVES, for the Navy, and the WACs, for the Army.         Their total enrollment was 250,000, of which the women Marines constituted 23,000 by the war's end. The men in service numbered 12 million.         Mrs. Streeter, who was born in Brookline, Mass., moved to Morristown in 1922. She attended Bryn Mawr College for two years.         Among the organizations in which she was active before the war were the New Jersey State Relief Council, the New Jersey Commission on Interstate Cooperation, the New Jersey Board of Children's Guardians and the New Jersey State Historical Sites Council.         After the war, she was a delegate to the New Jersey Constitutional Convention in 1947 and a member of the state's Veterans Service Council. She was a Republican Presidential elector in 1960. She also served with county and township organizations.         Besides her son Thomas W., she is survived by two other sons, Frank S., of Manhattan, and Henry S., of Wenham, Mass.; a daughter, Lilian S. L. Chance, of Malvern, Pa.; 17 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.       
        Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.         Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.         With her husband, Edgar Ansel Mowrer, a Pulitizer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for The Chicago Daily News, Mrs. Mowrer was close to events in Italy during the rise of Mussolini, in Germany during the rise of Hitler and in France until it fell to the Nazis in 1940.         She and Mr. Mowrer, who won his Pulitzer in 1933, were forced by the Nazis to leave Germany the same year. He died in 1977.         Mrs. Mowrer's first book, ''Journalist's Wife,'' appeared in 1937 and was promptly banned in Germany by the Nazis. Her last book, published in 1961, was ''The Indomitable John Scott: Citizen of Long Island,'' a biography of a 17th-century Colonial adventurer.         Mrs. Mowrer, who was born in England and met her husband there in 1911, also wrote theater criticism and articles on politics for such publications as Vanity Fair and Town and Country and for British newspapers.         She is survived by her daughter, Diana M. Beliard, of Chicago, and a granddaughter.       
        Olya Margolin, the Washington representative of the National Council of Jewish Women for more than 30 years before her retirement in 1978, died yesterday at the Washington Hospital Center. She was 81 years old and lived in Washington.         Olya Margolin, the Washington representative of the National Council of Jewish Women for more than 30 years before her retirement in 1978, died yesterday at the Washington Hospital Center. She was 81 years old and lived in Washington.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her husband, Benjamin, said.         Mrs. Margolin joined the council during World War II and was a leader in efforts after the war to bring displaced people from Europe to the United States. She was also active in forming civil rights coalitions in the 1960's and in promoting equal opportunity legislation.         She was born in Lithuania and was brought to the United States as a child.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Margolin is survived by a son, Victor, of Evanston, Ill., and a granddaughter.       
        Hortense Hirsch, a volunteer for social-welfare, educational and civic organizations and a trustee of Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than half a century, died on Tuesday at her suite in the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan.

She was 103 years old. During a career as a volunteer that began in the early years of the century, she was active in many organizations, including the Welfare and Health Council, now the Community Council of Greater New York; the National Urban League and the American Red Cross.         On her 80th birthday in 1967, Mount Sinai was joined by the United Hospital Fund, the United Jewish Appeal, the New York Association for New Americans, the Play Schools Association, the New York City Y.W.C.A., the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Smith College Club of New York - all of which Mrs. Hirsch served for long periods as an officer, director, trustee or founder -in paying special tribute to her.         She contributed money as well as her time, benefiting institutions like Smith College, from which she graduated in 1907 at the age of 19; Northwestern University Law School, from which her father, Levy Mayer, graduated, and Princeton, where she endowed scholarships in memory of her husband, Walter A. Hirsch, a lawyer, who died in 1938, and their son, Lawrence, who died in 1960.         'I Do What I Can'         Mrs. Hirsch also worked on behalf of many political candidates and frequently wrote to legislators on issues about which she or her organizations were concerned.         Seven years ago, when she was 96 years old and still active as a Mount Sinai trustee, a post she assumed in 1932, Mrs. Hirsch was asked why she had worked so long as a volunteer.         ''I never know how I'm going to feel tomorrow,'' she said. ''But I do what I can when I can. This work is still very important to me.''         She was born in Chicago and came to New York to stay in 1909, when she married Mr. Hirsch. She spoke French, Italian and German, and the couple traveled extensively around the world.         Throughout her life Mrs. Hirsch had a flair for the unconventional. As an undergraduate at Smith, she managed to have her own horse and buggy by persuading a farmer to board the animal and keep her secret from the college authorities.         Honored by Smith College         At Smith, she was a member of the executive committee for many years. In 1968, she was awarded the Smith College Medal, given to those who ''exemplify in their lives and service to their community or to the college the true purpose of liberal arts education.''         In 1940, two years after her husband's death and in the year in which both her daughter and her son left home to marry, Mrs. Hirsch took a suite at the Pierre for six months, to give herself time to decide where to live permanently. She never moved, bought her suite when the Pierre went cooperative and at her death was the Pierre's longest-term resident.         She is survived by her daughter, Carol Kridel of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.       
        Teresa De Francisci, who was the model for Miss Liberty on the Peace Dollar of 1921, died Saturday morning at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Teresa De Francisci, who was the model for Miss Liberty on the Peace Dollar of 1921, died Saturday morning at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure following surgery, her daughter said.         Mrs. De Francisci's stylized portrait as Miss Liberty appeared on the silver dollar issued to mark the return of peace at the end of World War I. It was the work of her husband, Anthony, a sculptor and the creator of many medals, including the inaugural medal for the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York.         On the 50th anniversary of the Peace Dollar, Mrs. De Francisci was honored by numismatists with a plaque inscribed, ''To a Lady of Peace.'' Now a collector's item, the Peace Dollar was issued from 1921 through 1928 and again in 1934 and 1935 before being discontinued.         'Wasn't a Portrait of Me at All'         ''I was just an accessory,'' Mrs. De Francisci was quoted as saying on the 60th anniversary of the coin. ''And really, my husband wasn't making a portrait of me. He wanted to make an idealized portrait of what freedom represented to him, so it really wasn't a portrait of me at all.''         Teresa De Francisci, whose maiden name was Cafarelli, was born in a town south of Naples. At 4 years old, she sailed to this country with her mother in steerage class. She grew up in Clinton, Mass., where her father had a grocery store. Her family recalls with pride that she was the first Italian-American to graduate from the local high school.         At 22, she married Mr. De Francisci, also an Italian immigrant. The New York sculptor was beginning to be known as a medalist, having designed another commemorative coin: the 1920 half dollar marking the centennial of Maine's statehood.         The De Franciscis never saved a 1921 Peace Dollar, which later acquired considerable value. ''Anthony was content to do the creating and let others do the collecting,'' his wife once said.         She is survived by one daughter, Gilda Slate of Manhattan.

        Joan M. Alvarez, a television producer who in 1979 shared an Emmy Award for a documentary titled ''Angela's Island,'' died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Joan M. Alvarez, a television producer who in 1979 shared an Emmy Award for a documentary titled ''Angela's Island,'' died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         She died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said her son David, of Parsippany, N.J.         A graduate of Smith College, Mrs. Alvarez worked for The New York World Telegram and Sun for three years during World War II before interrupting her career to care for her family. From 1975 to 1981, she was with NBC in New York as an associate director for local programming. She published two short stories and, at the time of her death, was writing a novel that was to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         In addition to her son David, she is survived by her son Jeremy, of Philadelphia; a brother, Clair Maxwell of Orlando, Fla.; a sister, Hope Tate, of Oxford, Mich., and two grandsons.       
         Joan Brown, an artist and professor of art at the University of California at Berkeley, was killed on Friday in an accident in Proddatura, India. She was 52 years old and lived in San Francisco.         The accident occurred while Ms. Brown, who in recent years was known for her use of imagery from ancient cultures, was installing her work in a reflecting pool at the new Heritage Museum, still under construction at Proddatura. Colleagues at the University of California said a concrete turret from a balcony collapsed and fell on her.         Starting out in the mid-1960's as a figurative painter in the thickly pigmented style of the so-called second-generation Bay Area artists, Ms. Brown gradually lightened her mode of painting and concentrated on imagery drawn from her personal life. A long-distance swimmer who regarded the sport as a means of meditation, she at this time used many images of swimmers in her art. Student of World Cultures         In the early 1970's she began traveling, informally studying world cultures. She drew inspiration for her work from the Egyptian and Hindu religions, and she made obelisks adorned with decorative patterns incorporating symbolic animal and human forms. In recent years, because of political and moral objections to the sale of art, she became involved in public art projects and made an effort to withdraw her work from the market.         Born and brought up in San Francisco, Ms. Brown attended the California School of Fine Arts -- later to become the San Francisco Art Institute -- from 1956 to 1960, and later received a master's degree in fine arts there, in 1962. In 1974 she joined the department of art at Berkeley, where, said Christopher Brown, the chairman of the department, she consistently won the highest rating as a teacher from faculty members and students.         Ms. Brown is survived by her husband, Michael Hebel, and a son, Noel Neri.       
        Eleanor Steber, a leading soprano at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1940's and 50's who was particularly noted for her Mozart and Strauss roles, died yesterday morning at the Attleboro Nursing Home in Langhorne, Pa. She was 76 years old. She died of congestive heart failure, said her representative, Martha Moore         Eleanor Steber, a leading soprano at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1940's and 50's who was particularly noted for her Mozart and Strauss roles, died yesterday morning at the Attleboro Nursing Home in Langhorne, Pa. She was 76 years old. She died of congestive heart failure, said her representative, Martha Moore Smith.         Miss Steber had a silvery soprano of considerable size with a pungent vibrato and impressive control of ornamentation. Her Met debut role in 1940 was Sophie in Strauss's ''Rosenkavalier,'' and she sang Strauss roles throughout her career.         She was especially admired for her Mozart heroines, moving from the lyrical (Pamina in ''Die Zauberflote'') through the more dramatic and ornamented (Constanze in ''Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail'' in that opera's Met premiere in 1946, Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' the Countess in ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' and Donna Elvira in ''Don Giovanni'') to the highly dramatic (Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni'').         At the Bayreuth Festival         Although she sang a wide range of German, Italian and French parts, she gradually assumed heavier roles in the 1950's, including the ''Rosenkavalier'' Marschallin and Elsa in Wagner's ''Lohengrin,'' which she also sang and recorded at the Bayreuth Festival in West Germany.         Miss Steber was born in Wheeling, W. Va., on July 17, 1914, two years earlier than the date published in most standard reference works, Miss Smith said. She studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and privately in New York, and won the 1940 Metropolitan Opera radio auditions, which led to her company debut.         Her Met career included 404 performances of 33 roles from 1940 to 1966. She sang the title roles in the world premiere of Samuel Barber's ''Vanessa'' in 1958 and in the American premiere of Strauss's ''Arabella'' in 1955. She also sang Marie in the Met's first performance of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' in 1959. In addition to Bayreuth, she appeared at many other European festivals, including those in Edinburgh, Vienna and Florence, and with several American companies.         As part of an active concert and recording career, she made more than 100 albums and commissioned and first performed Barber's concert aria, ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915.'' She also appeared on radio, television and, in the 1960's, in musicals.         'I Was Knocked for a Loop'         In 1962, Rudolf Bing, then general manager of the Met, declined to rehire the singer.         ''He told me I wouldn't miss the Met at all,'' Miss Steber recalled in 1973. ''I tell you, I was knocked for a loop.'' She did make one final appearance at the Met in 1966, replacing Dorothy Kirsten.         Miss Steber continued to sing into the 1970's, often appearing in duo recitals with Blanche Thebom and presenting three solo recitals in 1973 at Alice Tully Hall. That same year she also sang Miss Wingrave in the American premiere of Britten's ''Owen Wingrave'' with the Santa Fe Opera.         Her later years were primarily devoted to teaching. She was head of the voice department at the Cleveland Institute from 1963 to 1972, and taught at the Juilliard School in the 1970's and at Brooklyn College in the 1980's. In 1975, she established the Eleanor Steber Foundation to help young singers.         She is survived by a sister, Lucille Leslie of Newtown, Pa.; a brother, William C. Steber of State College, Pa., two stepdaughters and one stepson.       
        Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Mrs. Behrman, who was known as Madame Alexander, began designing dolls for her father, a Russian emigre, during World War I, when she began making ''Red Cross Nurse'' rag dolls. In 1923 she founded the Alexander Doll Company, in which she produced rag dolls with innovative three-dimensional facial features that she hand-painted. In the 1930's she began making dolls with lifelike details like eyes with lashes that closed and fingers with knuckles.         With the advent of plastic after World War II, she made dolls with vinyl heads and elaborate hair that could be styled. She also created designer clothing for the dolls and received international attention. In 1953, a collection of her dolls featuring, in authentic detail, Queen Elizabeth I and 35 principals at her coronation was presented to the Brooklyn Children's Museum.         In 1965, she was honored by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Arthur Goldberg, for her collection of international dolls that featured the native dress of every country represented at the U.N.         She also created dolls that portrayed characters in books and movies like Alice in Wonderland, Orphan Annie, Nancy Drew, the four sisters in ''Little Women'' and characters from Charles Dickens's books. Her ''Madame'' doll, based on the American Revolution, and her ''Scarlett O'Hara'' doll, portraying the Civil War era in ''Gone with the Wind,'' were included in the Smithsonian Institution in 1968.         She also designed children's clothing and won four Fashion Academy gold medals. Her company, which was sold two years ago to two New York businessmen, has created more than 5,000 different dolls at its factory in on West 131st Street in Harlem, where it has about 600 employees and is one of the area's largest employers. Many of the dolls have become collectors' items and sell for about $5,000.         She is survived by a daughter, Mildren Birnbaum of Purchase, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.; a grandson, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Rosemarie R. Schoeffer, founder of the Rosemarie de Paris chocolate shops, died yesterday in New York Hospital. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her son Peter said.         She opened her first chocolate shop in Paris in 1928 at the age of 18. Two years later she came to the United States and opened Rosemarie de Paris in the St. Regis Hotel building, making her own chocolate on a stove behind a curtain in the back of the shop.         By the late 1940's, Ms. Schoeffer was running 13 Rosemarie de Paris shops in cities across the country, including Palm Beach, Fla., Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Her chocolates were considered to be of the finest quality, and very expensive.         She liked to tell how during World War II, a serviceman dropped into her Manhattan tearoom-sweetshop and asked what the difference was between her chocolates at $9 a pound and those at $5 a pound. "Four dollars," she said, feeling sorry for the man in uniform, who turned out to be Alfred Vanderbilt.         In 1947, she divorced her first husband and married a Manhattan financier, Fred Schoeffer. She decided then to close down her chocolate shops, and after that only made truffles occasionally at home for the family.         Born Rosemarie Eugenie Roggemans in Brussels, she eloped with a Belgian, Georges Binon. They went to Paris, where she learned her trade by working in a chocolate shop.         In addition to her son Peter, of Alford, Mass., she is survived by another son, Ralph G.. of Cape Coral, Fla.       
         Mildred Riorden Blake, a former New York advertising writer who was a founder of the World Federalists, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Williamstown, Mass. She was 93 years old and lived in Williamstown.         Mrs. Blake was active in civic and political circles, in particular the World Federalists, founded in 1938. She represented Friends of the Earth, an organization concerned with the environment, at the United Nations in the 1960's.         She was a writer for Young & Rubicam Inc., a New York advertising agency, for 18 years.         Her second husband, William Paul Blake, died in 1962.         She is survived by her son from a former marriage, Shane Edwin Riorden of Williamstown; a brother, Stanton Mighell of Aurora, Ill.; three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Bishop, past president and a board member of the New York chapter of the United Nations Association, which promotes the United Nations, died on Wednesday at the home of her son Arthur Lipper 3d in White Plains. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Bishop, a native New Yorker, was associated with the United Nations Association for 40 years. She was also a board member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the World Youth Forum, the New York Council on Alcoholism and the Institute for Mediterranean Affairs.         Besides her son Arthur, Mrs. Bishop, a widow, is survived by another son, A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J.; two stepdaughters, Susan Lipper and Randa Bishop, both of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Katharine Fisher Schwab, one of the first women to become an officer in the Navy at the outset of World War II, died on Monday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 92 years old and lived in Danbury.         She died of respiratory failure, her nephew, J. Christopher Schwab of White Plains, said.         Miss Schwab was a 1919 graduate of Vassar College. She enlisted in the Waves after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and was in the first class of officer candidates at Mount Holyoke College. She was commissioned as a lieutenant and was mustered out of the service in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant commander.         She was a member of the Danbury Zoning Commission and was president of the Danbury chapter of the League of Women Voters.         She is survived by two nephews and four nieces.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Carrol Joy, an educator and author, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 52 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of a brain tumor, said her brother, Skip Federber, of Los Angeles.         Dr. Joy, who had a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley, wrote books about ways to attack world hunger and was a consultant to CARE and other humanitarian organizations. She had been on the faculty of St. Mary's College in San Francisco and also wrote books on developmental education, including "Believing Is Seeing," published by the American Forum for Global Education.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, Scott Grabo of Arlington, Va., and a daughter, Carrie Grabo of Woodbury, Vt.; her mother, Pearle Carroll of Las Vegas, and two grandchildren.       
         Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a scholar of Jewish life and history whose book "The War Against the Jews" is widely regarded as a pioneering study of the Nazi genocide, died early Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, the daughter of Polish immigrants, was at the center of the study of the modern Jewish experience at Yeshiva University, where she held a chair in interdisciplinary Holocaust studies. Early in her career, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, she went to Europe, where she helped Jewish survivors of the war to re-create schools and libraries, and she recovered vast collections of books seized by the Nazis.         Before that, while in her early 20's, she had lived in Vilna, Poland, from 1938 to 1939, where she witnessed the onslaught of European anti-Semitism, writing about the experience in a memoir, "From That Place and Time," published by W. W. Norton last year. Her other books include "The Jewish Presence" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich) in 1977 and "The Holocaust and the Historians" (Harvard University Press), a critical survey of scholarship on the Holocaust, in 1981. Hopes Turn to Agonies         "There was a certain irony to my trip to Vilna," Mrs. Dawidowicz told an interviewer for Publisher's Weekly last year, speaking of her pre-war experience in Poland. "I went there with the romantic belief that it might become the world center for a self-sustaining Yiddish culture."         When she saw what turned out to be the beginning of the end of Jewish life in Poland, she immersed herself in Yiddish literature and Jewish history, so that she could help to preserve Jewish culture in the postwar world.         Mrs. Dawidowicz (pronounced dah-vee-DOH-vich), a small energetic woman who spoke in the accents of the Bronx, engaged in heated arguments within Jewish circles over both the nature of the Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent it.         Her major work, "The War Against the Jews," postulates that the destruction of the Jews was a central and inescapable element in Nazi ideology and was always a principle war aim of Hitler, just as important as his military conquest of Europe. In this view, she conflicted with other historians, who believed that the Holocaust was not a necessary part of the Nazi program but evolved in response to such circumstances as the defeats on the Eastern front.  Evidence Over Passion         "The War Against the Jews" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston) was called "a work of high scholarship and profound moral import" by Irving Howe, in his review in The New York Times Book Review. It is marked above all by its sobriety. Mrs. Dawidowicz allows the coolly accumulated weight of detail -- the growing force of the Nazi's anti-Semitic juggernaut, the evolution of the camps as places of scientific murder, the efforts by the victims to hold onto fragments of normal life -- to create its emotional and intellectual impact.         Mrs. Dawidowicz refused to judge the failure of the Jews themselves to mount a more active resistance to the genocide, and in this she clashed bitterly with a number of other historians.         Her belief was twofold. First, she felt it morally inappropriate for those who did not face the persecutions themselves to criticize the behavior of those who did. Second, she felt that in any case, Jewish resistance was doomed to failure. Given the Jews' isolation, their lack of arms and the overwhelming material superiority of their enemies, there was virtually nothing they could have done to alter their fate, she wrote.  Defended Role of Jews         In her book "The Holocaust and the Historians," Mrs. Davidowicz is critical of a number of historians and commentators -- Bruno Bettelheim, Hannah Arendt and Raul Hilberg are among those she mentions -- who described the European Jews during the war as passive, cowardly or, in the case of the Judenrat, set up by the Nazis as self-governing boards in the ghettos, even collaborationist.         Similarly, Mrs. Dawidowicz rejected a chorus of opinion to the effect that Jews in the United States were guilty of complacency and a failure to react effectively to the Holocaust.         In articles in Commentary magazine and The New York Times, she wrote, first, that the Jews here did undertake wipespread efforts to awaken the government and world opinion to the fate of the European Jews. Second, she argued that, in any case, whatever might have been done here, the Jews of Europe were caught in a vise from which virtually no escape was ever possible. The only way to save them, she believed, was to militarily defeat the Nazis as quickly as possible, and that fact justified the Allies' concentration on the war effort, rather than on efforts to save the Jews.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, whose maiden name was Lucy Schildkret, was born in New York in 1915 and educated at Hunter College and Columbia University. She recounts in "From That Time and Place" how she began to work for YIVO's Manhattan branch after her year in Vilna. She met her husband, Szymon Dawidowicz, an escapee from Poland there. Mr. Dawidowicz died in 1979.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, who had no children, is survived by her sister, Eleanor Sapak.       
         Alice Marble, a Californian who grudgingly gave up baseball and grew into America's No. 1 female tennis player by winning the United States women's amateur singles title four times between 1936 and 1940, died yesterday at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. Miss Marble, a longtime resident of Palm Desert, Calif., was 77 years old.         Miss Marble, who suffered from pernicious anemia, according to her sister-in-law, Bernice Marble of San Francisco, was admitted to the hospital on Saturday and died at 1:35 A.M. yesterday. A hospital spokesman, Randy Bevilacqua, gave no cause of death.         To achieve her stature as the golden-haired queen of women's tennis, Miss Marble had to overcome obstacles. Born on Sept. 13, 1913, in the lumber town of Beckwith in the Sierra Nevadas, she left with her parents and three brothers at the age of 5 to grow up in San Francisco, a chubby girl athlete, adept at boxing, baseball and basketball. Turned to Tennis at 15         Her athletic skills were not turned to tennis until the age of 15. The former Little Queen of Swat learned the game quickly in Golden Gate Park. After winning many junior tournaments in California, her progress was slowed in 1933 by a case of sunstroke after she played 108 games of tennis in one day at East Hampton, L.I.         Then, in 1934, she suffered a complete collapse during a French-American series of matches at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris, which led to a diagnosis of pleurisy. She required a year of rest in a sanitarium, causing her to miss most of the 1934 and 1935 seasons.         When she applied to play in the national amateur championship at Forest Hills in 1936, the tournament committee refused to accept her entry, saying she was unfit to play and might permanently jeopardize her health. But after practicing a week, Miss Marble persuaded the committee to accept her entry and she went on to win her first national championship. Ranked No. 1 in 1936-1940         As the No. 1-ranked woman from 1936 to 1940, she dominated the game. She won the United States singles title again in 1938, 1939 and 1940 and the women's singles at Wimbledon in 1939.         With Sarah Palfrey Fabyan she won the United States women's doubles championships from 1937 through 1940 and the mixed-doubles title with Gene Mako in 1936, with Donald Budge in 1938, with Harry Hopman in 1939 and with Bobby Riggs in 1940. At Wimbledon, she also won the women's doubles in 1938 and 1939 with Mrs. Fabyan and the mixed doubles with Budge in 1937 and 1938 and with Riggs in 1939.         In 1939, she had won the singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles at both Forest Hills and Wimbledon and in 1940 she was undefeated. As a member of four winning Wightman Cup teams in matches against Britain during the 1930's she lost only one match in singles and one in doubles. Aided by a Coach         After her illness, Miss Marble was aided by the coaching of Eleanor Tennant, who made changes in her strokes. Miss Marble played an all-out athletic game complete with strong volleys and smashes. She was also adept at the twist serve and possessed a strong backhand. She was unusually quick on her feet and used her speed to good advantage while attacking the net.         Jack Kramer, a member of the Tennis Hall of Fame, said yesterday of Miss Marble: "She was the lady who most changed the style of play for women. She introduced the aggressive and athletic style that has led down to the female stars of today like Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf."         "Alice Marble was a picture of unrestrained athleticism," said Billie Jean King. "She is remembered as one of the greatest women to play the game because of her pioneering style in power tennis. I also admired her tremendously because she always helped others." Became a Pro After 1940         After her conquests of 1939 and 1940, Miss Marble renounced her amateur standing and turned professional. Since there were no professional tournaments for women, she played a series of exhibitions until the outbreak of World War II, when she enlisted in the Hale America movement to assist in improving the physical condition of women and youngsters.         She also played exhibition tennis matches to entertain servicemen and to promote the sales of war bonds. She was inducted into the Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., in 1964 with Donald Budge, her former mixed-doubles partner.         In 1946 she published a book "The Road to Wimbledon." She said she wrote it "because of so many requests from friends and fans who asked me to tell them the secret of success." Autobiography to Be Published         After the war, she continued to play exhibition matches and give tennis clinics in the United States and abroad. She also designed sportswear and traveled as a lecturer.         Her autobiogrpahy, "Courting Danger," written with Dale Leatherman, is scheduled for publication in June 1991, by St. Martin's Press.         In it, according to Miss Leatherman, Miss Marble writes of her marriage to Joe Crowley, an Army pilot who was shot down and killed over Germany during World War II. She also told of accepting an assignment as a spy for Army Intelligence in 1945 to gather information in Switzerland about German financial accounts. During the operation, she was shot in the back, but was rescued by her military intelligence contact and recovered. She was told not to mention the operation to anyone after the war.

Mrs. Doll died of complications following surgery for a brain tumor, said Robert Fizdale, the pianist, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. Doll, born in St. Petersburg, left the Soviet Union in 1926.

         Nan Wood Graham, the model for the tight-lipped farm woman in the painting "American Gothic," died Friday in a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 91 years old.         The 1930 painting by her brother Grant Wood, the regionalist artist, portrays a somber farmer bearing a pitchfork and his equally somber daughter standing before a cottage in Eldon in southeast Iowa. The model for the farmer was Dr. Byron McKeeby, a dentist who lived in the Woods' hometown of Anamosa, Iowa.         The painting initially provoked complaints in Cedar Rapids, where some women protested that Mrs. Graham was poking fun at them with her dour depiction of an Iowa farm woman. One woman wrote to say Mrs. Graham's face would "sour milk."         But the painting, and Mrs. Graham, eventually gained wide popularity in her home state.         If her brother had gone through with his original intention of using another model, the secretarial school graduate said she would have whiled away her days as "the world's worst stenographer."         "Grant made a personality out of me," she once said. "I would have had a very drab life without it."         She was protective of "American Gothic," bringing suit several times against the frequent caricatures and parodies. The painting is kept at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her brother died in 1942.         Born in Anamosa, she attended Polk School and Washington High School in Cedar Rapids. In 1924, she married a real estate investor, Edward Graham. The couple settled in Riverside, Calif., and had no children.         In 1984, widowed and going blind, Mrs. Graham entered a Menlo Park nursing home, ending a lifetime job as historian of her brother's work.
