         Betty Macdonald Batcheller, the last surviving member of Martha Graham's first dance company, died on Jan. 15 at the Greenwich Laurelton Nursing Home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 92.         Ms. Batcheller, who danced as Betty Macdonald, met Graham at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she studied with the choreographer in the mid-1920's. In 1926 Graham selected her, Evelyn Sabin and Thelma Biracree to perform with her at the 48th Street Theater in Manhattan on April 18 in her first independent program as a choreographer.         All three were under 21 at the time. The atmosphere of preparation for that first concert was heady with poverty and an intense devotion to Graham and her ideals, with Ms. Batcheller and Sabin saving the threads that unraveled from Graham's teaching clothes.         A few days before the performance the three dancers gave Graham a costly carnelian necklace inscribed ''To Miss Martha with Love.'' Graham wore the necklace under her costume in one of the 18 dances on the program.         The three performed in pieces that included the melting ''Arabesque No. 1,'' set to Debussy, and ''The Three Gopi Maidens.'' Little critical attention was paid to the program, whose dances Don McDonagh describes as ''impressionism but with muscles'' in his book ''Martha Graham, A Biography.'' But a large audience attended, and a second program was given on May 27 in Rochester.         Ms. Batcheller danced with Graham until 1930, when she left to perform on her own in New York, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Rochester.         She shifted to theater in the 1930's, studying at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and in New York at the Neighborhood Playhouse before joining Clare Tree Major's Children's Theater in 1934. She also performed in summer stock in Putney, Vt., and with Bob Elwyn's Maverick Theater in Woodstock, N.Y.         Ms. Macdonald married C. Robin Batcheller, a fellow actor, in 1935. The two performed together for several years with the Major and Elwyn companies. Her last performance was in 1939 on Broadway in ''The American Way.''         Mr. Batcheller died in 1983. Ms. Batcheller is survived by a brother, Donald Macdonald, of Webster, N.Y., and a son, Michael, of Greenwich.       
         Frances Messersmith Miner, who for 43 years nurtured tulips, radishes and children at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, died Monday in Utica, N.Y., her brother said. She was 94 and lived in a nursing home in nearby Clinton.         Miss Miner learned of the Brooklyn children's garden, the first to be included within a scientific botanic garden, as a freshman at Smith College when her botany professor mentioned it. She made a note that that was ''something I'd like to do.''         Seven years later, in 1930, she began working at the children's garden under the tutelage of its founder, Ellen Eddy Shaw, who began it in 1914 on a single acre of the 52-acre Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         Miss Miner, tall, slender and less frail than she seemed, looked as if she belonged in a garden: she favored straw hats and print dresses.         She relished getting down on her hands and knees to weed at a time when not many women did. Her title was curator of instruction, but she was called ''the botanic lady'' by generations of youngsters, some of whom were inspired to become influential gardeners as adults.         ''To me, she seemed to know everything,'' said Helen Mattin, who almost seven decades ago began crossing Washington Avenue as an 8-year-old to take classes and is now a major benefactor to the garden. ''It was great to be with someone who just poured out love to me.''         Scott Appell, who started gardening at 9 in 1963 and is now educational director at the Horticultural Society of New York, emphasized that Miss Miner provided much more than engaging baby-sitting. There were written tests, badges and medals for high achievement. Well-kept children's plots were marked with signs with a white star on a green background; those needing work got a sign with a blue question mark.         ''When we went to class on Saturday, it was just like being in school,'' he said. ''It was not informal at all. It was very hard. We were taught a sense of responsibility.''         A tangible example of the responsibility Miss Miner demanded was the care of gardening tools. Hoes, rakes and trowels dating back more than 80 years can be seen gleaming on the racks of the Children's Garden House, which last year was refurbished and named for Miss Miner.         Once, when tomato stakes needed painting, she bought green paint and asked the children to do it. Naturally, everybody went home green, but ''she knew that if the children painted the stakes, they would take better care of them,'' said Daphne Welch Day, a longtime colleague.         Miss Miner summed up her approach in a publication for the Brooklyn garden. ''I believe that students, especially beginners in this adventure, should be participants rather than spectators,'' she wrote. ''A feeling of ownership and a sense of responsibility for the care of a plant 'pet' elicit an entirely different kind of response than viewing displays of plants, no matter how spectacular.''         Miss Miner was born in Plainfield, N.J., and grew up in Oriskany Falls, N.Y. After graduating from Smith, she worked briefly with the Girl Scouts in Elmira, N.Y., then accepted a post at the Brooklyn garden as an educational assistant.         Friends quickly came to appreciate her sometimes quirky approach. She liked to be known by her initials, FMM. Each day she would jot notes on the subway to and from her home on 110th Street in Manhattan. They would be daily distributed to ''DW,'' ''AB,'' and her other colleagues.         She is survived by her brother Charles of Oriskany Falls.         In addition to writing about botanical topics for publications like the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society in England, she wrote a 95-page children's book called ''The Adventure Book of Growing Plants.''         Her joy was seeing a child learn a  lesson about plants. She wrote of a boy named Johnny who despaired because his plants were thriving and healthy but lacked tomatoes. It turned out that Johnny was meticulously picking off the blossoms, which he called ''old yellow flowers.''         ''Johnny learned the hard way that a blossom is necessary to fruit production and that fruits lead to seed which in turn lead to new plants and more flowers,'' she wrote. ''Johnny took home more than tomatoes.''       
         Mary Cantwell, who wrote essays, books and editorials for The New York Times, many about the changing public and private lives of women in America, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Margaret Lescher of Riverdale, the Bronx.         As a member of The Times editorial board for 16 years, Ms. Cantwell wrote often about issues affecting women. A notable one concerned ''the squeal rule,'' the label she coined for a 1982 Reagan administration proposal to forbid giving contraceptives to teenagers unless their parents were informed. Such a rule, she wrote, would discourage effective contraception and increase teenage pregnancies.         ''Thanks to the coinage,'' the columnist William Safire later wrote, ''the battle is being won by the anti-squeal forces.''         Apart from unsigned editorials, Ms. Cantwell wrote personal observations for The Times and elsewhere about the pride and pain brought by three decades of transformation in the lives of women, particularly in the spheres of work, marriage and divorce, and parenthood.         Why could she not cry about a sick calico cat, she wondered in a ''Close to Home'' column in 1990. One reason, she realized, is that ''Women were reputed to weep on the job.''         ''Not this woman. No way I was going to let somebody know I'd been gotten at; no way I was going to give somebody that satisfaction.''         On divorce, she gave voice to many readers' feelings in a ''Hers'' column in The Times in 1980, describing the day she and her former husband watched their older daughter's high school graduation: ''There on stage is someone who is half he, half she; their blood, their genes. They created somebody: the woman is awed. As long as there is a she, the woman thinks, there is an us.''         Starting in her childhood in Bristol, R.I., Ms. Cantwell was an acute observer of the era in which she lived.         ''I never wanted to be anything but a writer,'' she once said, ''but I saw no hope, had no expectations. I feel, perhaps wrongly, that I grew up in an era when writing was very much a boys' club. It took a brave woman, braver than I, to write books.''         Still, she wrote three. The first, ''American Girl'' (Random House, 1992), was a love letter to Bristol. A Times reader ''wrote in and said there is a small town in the background of everything I ever wrote, so why didn't I write about that small town,'' she said. And so she did, about a three-generation household in a town where the oldest resident carried a gold-headed cane to lead the Fourth of July parade.         After ''American Girl,'' her readers wrote in again. Now they wanted to know what happened to that girl. ''New York was what happened to that girl,'' Ms. Cantwell said, explaining how she came to write ''Manhattan, When I Was Young'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1995). It described her life in the prosperous postwar years, the heyday of the Stork Club and Bonwit Teller.         In her third book, ''Speaking With Strangers'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), she talked about pushing herself to travel, after the end of her marriage to Robert Lescher, a literary agent.  She also described an on-again-off-again affair with a celebrated Southern writer she identified only as ''the balding man,'' a womanizer who dropped her for someone younger.         She said that she had not wanted to distract readers by naming him. Later, after many critics and some readers had guessed, she acknowledged him to be James Dickey.         After Ms. Cantwell graduated from Connecticut College in 1953, she landed a job in New York as a copywriter at Mademoiselle magazine, where she worked during the next 23 years, including 9 as managing editor and features editor.         In 1980, she was invited to be one of the early guest writers of the Hers column in The Times. Later that year, she joined the Times editorial board, commenting on social policy issues like smoking, abortion and assisted suicide, and on whimsical topics such as the world as seen from the M10 bus.         In 1981, she wrote ''Dear Abby,'' a widely quoted editorial about Evangeline Gouletas-Carey, the new wife of Hugh L. Carey, the governor of New York. Before the wedding, Mrs. Gouletas-Carey described herself as a widow. But her former husband turned up alive and well, and so did two other former husbands she had not mentioned.         ''Dear Abby'' read as if it were a letter to the advice columnist from Mrs. Gouletas-Carey. ''What I want to know is, Abby, can you think of a way I might have avoided all this fuss?'' It was signed, ''Wondering.''         She matured as a writer, she said, after she discovered the novelist Jean Rhys. ''That was a writer I could best emulate,'' she said last year. ''That was a life and sensibility I understood.''         She was struck by one Rhys observation: ''If I stop writing my life will have been an abject failure,'' Rhys wrote in ''Smile, Please,'' an autobiographical memoir. ''I will not have earned death.''         Ms. Cantwell reflected on that in a 1980 ''Hers'' column. ''To earn one's death,'' she wrote, ''I think of it as a kind of parlor game. How, I shall ask my friends, would you like to earn your deaths? And how would I like to earn mine? The question is strangely liberating, implying as it does action, energy, choice. In fact, it has an unexpectedly American ring: death as First Prize. I like it -- it makes the nights less frightening.''         Besides Margaret Lescher, she is survived by another daughter, Katherine Lescher of Sydney, Australia;  her mother, Mary G. Cantwell of Bristol; a sister, Diana Nickerson of Pittsburgh; and a granddaughter.       
         Doris Kenner-Jackson, a founding member of the Shirelles, one of the first and most emotionally affecting of pop's girl groups, died on Friday at a hospital in Sacramento, Calif. She was 58.         The cause was breast cancer, said her niece, Lauren Nance.         Ms. Kenner-Jackson was born Doris Coley in 1941 in Goldsboro, N.C., and moved with her family to Passaic, N.J., as a teenager. She soon began performing at parties and talent shows with her friends Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston Reeves), Addie Harris and Beverly Lee.         A classmate introduced the foursome to her mother, Florence Greenberg, the pioneering manager and a founder of Tiara Records, who soon signed the group to record for her label.         The Shirelles co-wrote their first single, the precocious schoolyard round ''I Met Him on a Sunday,'' which earned so much radio play that Decca Records bought it and distributed it nationally. After that, the group recorded many hits and earned ardent fans including the Beatles, who covered the quartet's songs ''Baby It's You'' and ''Boys.''         Ms. Kenner-Jackson usually sang harmonies during the Shirelles' heyday, but she did take the lead on the group's passionate version of the Five Royales' song, ''Dedicated to the One I Love.'' Her vocals captured the reckless yearning of the teenage heart.         She also sang the lead on many lesser-known Shirelles songs, including ''Blue Holiday'' and ''I Saw a Tear.''         The Shirelles stayed together until 1968, broke up and reunited, and finally splintered in the 1970's. Ms. Kenner-Jackson kept performing in one of three postbreakup versions of the group.         She briefly worked for Federal Express in the 1970's, but mostly stayed active on the oldies-revival circuit. Despite her two-year fight with cancer, she was entertaining audiences until a few weeks before her death, said Ms. Nance, of Paterson, N.J.         In 1994, when the Rhythm and Blues Foundation gave the Shirelles a Heritage Award, Ms. Kenner-Jackson sang with the group's other surviving members, Ms. Alston Reeves and Ms. Lee, for the first time in 19 years, Harris having died in 1982. The threesome met again when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.         Ms. Kenner-Jackson, who was married and divorced twice, is survived by four children, Antonio Kenner, Gary Kenner, Tracey Jackson, and Staci Jackson-Richardson, all of Sacramento; two sisters, Ernestine Francies of Passaic and Agnes Coley of Bloomfield, N.J.; a brother, Jeremiah Coley of Paterson, four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Christi Finch, whose catering shop, Word of Mouth, was among the first to produce luxury takeout food on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, died on Tuesday. She was 54.         Her death, at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, came after a prolonged gastrointestinal illness, her family said.         Ms. Finch's down-home charm made even the newest customers feel welcome when they shopped for  delicacies like brandied pate and a spiced pumpkin mousse or homespun offerings like meatloaf and giant chocolate chip cookies.         Ms. Finch and her partner, Eileen Weinberg, opened the first Word of Mouth on East 72nd Street near Lexington Avenue in 1976, at a time when most takeout food consisted of mundane fare. The partners had met at  Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital, where they both worked in administration. Discovering a shared love of food, the two self-taught cooks baked  cakes for doctors, some of whom became their backers.         Together Ms. Finch and Ms. Weinberg turned out their interpretations of ethnic foods, with a strong emphasis on Mediterranean cuisines, including Moroccan specialties, then rare in New York City. They offered copious portions of dishes that were at once lusty, yet subtly stylish, and their high prices rarely deterred affluent neighborhood customers.         Shortly after the shop moved to its present quarters at 1012 Lexington Avenue in 1979, Ms. Weinberg left to open a restaurant and her own takeout food shop, Good and Plenty to Go, in the Theater District.         Ms. Finch also opened Cafe Word of Mouth and began to work on a cookbook. The restaurant and cafe are still open.         Christi Kangas grew up in a food-oriented family in Cutler City, Ore.  Her father, George Kangas, was in the grocery business, and her mother, Janice, tested recipes at home for a local flour mill. Ms. Finch's lifelong appreciation of the freshest seasonal produce began in the vegetable garden of her grandmother.         As a young woman, Ms. Finch settled in New York, where she married Thomas Finch in 1967; they were divorced a few years later.         She is survived by her daughter, Pilar; her parents, of Lincoln City, Ore.; and her sisters, Kathryn Amrani, Sheila Coventry and Sharon Borgford, who all live in the Portland, Ore., area.       
         Margaret Rosezarian Harris, a musician and educator who was the first black woman to conduct the  symphony orchestras of Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota and 11 other American cities, died on March 7 in New York City. She was 56 and lived in Elmsford, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sandra G. Owen, a friend.         Ms. Harris was born in Chicago on Sept. 15, 1943, the only child of Dewey and Clara Townsend Harris. Before her fourth birthday, she played a public piano recital of 18 short pieces and three encores, all performed from memory. She was soon performing in halls as far from home as the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, earning as much as $2,000 a performance.         When she was 6, her parents ended the tours and placed her in school. At 10 she performed with the Chicago Symphony and won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.  Ms. Harris's mother moved with her to Philadelphia, working there as a dressmaker. Her father, a Pennsylvania Railroad mechanic, remained in Chicago, visiting his wife and daughter regularly until his death in 1967.         Ms. Harris later earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the Juilliard School. Her graduate work was supported by a grant from the Leopold Schepp Foundation. Ms. Harris would later become a trustee of the foundation.         Though piano was her first love and she played solo recitals in the United States and abroad, Ms. Harris gained the most prominence as a conductor. She worked on Broadway as well, notably as music director of the musical ''Hair,'' a position she took over in 1970. Her orchestra was made up of seven male musicians, all older than she.         ''They don't give me a bit of trouble personally or professionally,'' Ms. Harris was quoted as saying in a New York Times article about this pioneering engagement for a black woman. She added, ''It's like having an unlimited charge account at Saks Fifth Avenue.''         In 1995, she was invited by the United States Information Service of the United States Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to serve as an American cultural specialist for a production there of ''Porgy and Bess.''         Among her compositions are two ballets, an opera called ''King David'' and two piano concertos, the second of which was performed twice with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta.         Last month Ms. Harris was appointed associate dean of the Pennsylvania Academy of Music in Lancaster, a position she was scheduled to assume in June.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an aging French prostitute in screen and stage versions of ''Zorba the Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.         Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not reported by news agencies.         Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England, Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a French Cesar for the film ''Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for ''Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in Sicily for the film ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Ms. Kedrova was best known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ''Zorba.''         In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony Quinn, Miss Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying mistress.         ''The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.         When she recreated her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of The Times described Ms. Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ''a small, round, smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat ''her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing flirtatiousness.''         He said: ''Miss Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see the young 'cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we do. No wonder Miss Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''         The role that won Miss Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone Signoret.         But, Miss Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Miss Signoret withdrew, and Mr. Cacoyannis telephoned Ms. Kedrova in Paris to invite her to join his cast.         ''I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she told The Times of London some years ago. ''It was a fascinating role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win the Academy Award.''         There was one other problem, Miss Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Mr. Cacoyannis called, he asked if Miss Kedrova spoke English.         ''He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ''And I replied, 'Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''         But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung and expressions like ''How do you do?'' and ''Thank you,'' she got the part.         Miss Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.         A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ''Once I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ''When I was 12, I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do. And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris, who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them for three years.         ''In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''         So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who became her first husband.         In the early 1950's she began to achieve critical and popular success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like ''The Rose Tattoo,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''A Taste of Honey'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov.''         Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married in 1969, said that Miss Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors, made her last stage appearance in the early 1990's at the Chichester Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.         Some reference books listed Miss Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and Mr. Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left their papers behind. And the false papers they were given in France were confiscated by the Nazis.         ''She liked it that way,'' Mr. Howard said of her agelessness. ''I remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be 16.''       
         Evelyn Graham Irons, a war correspondent who had a romance with the Bloomsbury novelist and poet Vita Sackville-West, died April 3 at her home in Brewster, N.Y. She was two months short of her 100th birthday.         Ms. Irons was a 30-year-old editor of the women's page of The Daily Mail in London when she met Sackville-West in 1931. She had gone to interview the 38-year-old writer at her home, Sissinghurst Castle, renowned for its famous gardens, which Sackville-West spent much of her life designing and tending.         The romance was tangled. Sackville-West had already begun her enduring relationship with Violet Trefusis, the daughter of Alice Keppel, Edward VII's mistress. And Ms. Irons was romantically involved at the time with Olive Rinder, who soon also fell in love with Sackville-West.         Victoria Glendenning wrote in her 1983 biography, ''Vita: The Life of Vita Sackville-West,'' that by January 1932, the three women were in a menage a trois that ended later that year when Ms. Irons met and fell in love with another woman, Joy McSweeney. Ms. McSweeney remained her companion until she died in the 1980's.         The love poems dated 1931 in Vita Sackville-West's ''Collected Poems'' are addressed to Ms. Irons, although Ms. Glendenning notes that ''the more erotic ones'' were never published. Ms. Irons and Sackville-West remained close friends and corresponded warmly until Sackville-West's death in 1962.         Evelyn Irons was born in Glasgow on June 17, 1900. After graduating from Somerville College, Oxford, she began working as a journalist for The Daily Mail, then The Evening Standard. At the outbreak of World War II, The Standard made her a war correspondent. Suspecting that British commanders would not welcome a woman at their headquarters, she accredited herself to the First French Army and crossed the Rhine with Charles de Gaulle and accompanied French troops through Germany and Austria.         She is believed to be the first female war correspondent to reach Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden and was the first to win the Croix de Guerre.         Ms. Irons moved to New York in 1952. In 1954, she rode into Guatemala on a mule during a revolution there, getting to the action and filing her dispatches well ahead of her colleagues. She became the New York bureau chief for The Sunday Times of London at the end of the 1950's.         No immediate family members survive her.       
         Judge Kathryn A. McDonald, who as administrator of the family court system of New York City was a champion of children's rights, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her  daughter, K. Ann McDonald.         Judge McDonald, a graduate of Columbia's law school, was named the administrative judge for the five New York City Family Court complexes in 1986. She had the title of administrative judge of the Family Court of New York City and retired from the post in 1995.         During her tenure, she tried to improve the courts despite an explosion in the number of cases, budget cuts and crumbling facilities. The courts faced other new problems in the 90's, as well. In 1995, with difficult custody decisions being complicated by AIDS, and by relatives who had taken in the children, grown to love them and become unwilling to give them up without a fight, Judge McDonald said: ''A lot of the custody cases in the last few years have been families fighting each other. It's an in-house thing. It's an awkward thing.''         In 1987, she said that largely because of drug addiction, more and more of the Family Court cases involved abused or neglected children, who had flooded the court system and in turn had overburdened the foster care system.         After receiving her law degree in 1963, she became a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society's juvenile rights division and then attorney-in-charge of Legal Aid's Manhattan office. In 1976, she became a Family Court judge. She was briefly supervising judge of the Family Court in New York County before becoming the administrative judge.         Before entering law school in 1960, she worked in personnel and labor relations for 20 years. But one afternoon, she and a friend watched proceedings in Family Court at time when poor children were not given assigned counsel. Recalling that experience in an interview in 1986, she said: ''The rich kids all had lawyers, and the poor kids had nobody. I decided that I wanted to become a lawyer and represent children.''         While she was the administrative judge, she also headed the New York Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts, which was established after a two-year study had found that ''gender bias against women litigants, attorneys and court employees is a pervasive problem.''         In that post she carried out recommendations intended to rid the state courts of sex bias.         With her in charge, the committee reported in 1987 that sensitivity training for judges and other programs had helped reduce such bias.         Kathryn Austin was born in Albany, grew up in Long Lake, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Cornell. She was married for six decades to Robert J. McDonald, who was a tax lawyer with the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. He died last year.         Besides her daughter, K. Ann McDonald of Manhattan, a litigation lawyer with the Manhattan law firm of Robinson Murphy & McDonald, Judge McDonald is survived by a brother, Malcolm Patrick Austin of Chicago.       
         Emily W. ReedEmily W. Reed, who in 1959 enraged Alabama segregationists by allowing a book about a fuzzy white rabbit marrying a fuzzy black rabbit onto the shelves of the state's central library, died on May 19 at a retirement community in Cockeysville, Md. She was 89.         The confrontation came as blacks were fighting to be allowed in public libraries throughout the South and a segregationist in Florida was demanding that ''The Three Little Pigs'' be removed from library shelves because the pigs were depicted in different colors. Such disputes, mirroring the struggle for access to schools and public libraries, were widely covered in the press.         In Ms. Reed's case, the book in question was ''The Rabbits' Wedding,'' written and illustrated by Garth Williams and published by Harper & Brothers in 1958. The book, which described a moonlit wedding attended by all the animals of the forest, was intended for children 3 to 7 years of age.         The book was attacked by The Montgomery Home News, a publication of the Montgomery, Ala., chapter of the White Citizens Council, on the ground that it promoted racial integration.         In response, Ms. Reed, who was the director of the Alabama Public Library Service Division, which lent books to local libraries throughout the state, ordered the book to be put on the agency's reserve shelves. This meant that local librarians visiting Montgomery could get the book by requesting it, but could not find it on the open shelves.         Harpers issued a statement from Mr. Williams saying the book had ''no political significance.''         ''I was completely unaware that animals with white fur, such as white polar bears and white dogs and white rabbits, were considered blood relations of white human beings,'' Mr. Williams said.         He added that his tale of rabbits ''was not written for adults, who will not understand it because it is only about a soft, furry love and has no hidden messages of hate.''         Ms. Reed said at the time that she liked the book and that her action was not tantamount to banning it. In an interview with The New York Times, she said that some local libraries in Alabama continued to put the book on their open shelves but that the state agency had some difficulty with it.         State Senator E. O. Eddins of Marengo County, who led the fight against Mr. Williams's book, said Ms. Reed had refused to answer when he asked her if she believed in racial integration. She said this had nothing to do with running the library service.         A measure was then introduced in the Alabama Legislature to require the state library chief to be a native of Alabama and a graduate of the University of Alabama or Auburn University. That would have disqualified Ms. Reed, who was born in Ashville, N.C. But in 1960 she left Alabama to become coordinator of adult services for the Washington, D.C., library system.         Emily Wheelock Reed grew up in Indiana and graduated from Indiana University. She worked in libraries in Detroit, Hawaii and Louisiana and taught library science at the University of Florida before becoming Alabama's library director in 1959.         After six years with the Washington library system, Ms. Reed moved to Baltimore, where she was coordinator of adult services at the Enoch Pratt Free Library until she retired in 1977.         She was cited for her work in Alabama by the American Library Association, and this year received the scroll of honor from the Freedom to Read Foundation.         She had no immediate survivors.       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Ruth D. Turner, a Harvard professor, author, curator and diver who became one of the world's leading experts in the species of mollusks that devour wooden piers and sunken ships, died on April 30 at a nursing home in Waltham, Mass. She was 85.         Dr. Turner added volumes to the understanding of the creatures known as teredos, commonly called shipworms because of their resemblance to worms but actually a species of mollusk related to clams.         Sometimes called ''the mollusk with the million-dollar appetite,'' teredos were mentioned in Greek literature dating to 350 B.C. and were dreaded by early ocean explorers, including Columbus who lost all his vessels to the worms on his fourth voyage to the Americas. They have also been blamed for the deterioration of the Hudson River piers in New York City.         Dr. Turner even hypothesized that the pests caused the hole in the wooden dike that the Little Dutch Boy plugged with his finger. ''It may be the little Dutch boy put in more than his thumb,'' she said. ''He probably put his whole arm in there.''         Dr. Turner, who was affectionately called Lady Wormwood, wrote more than 100 publications, almost all on shipworms, covering everything from their means of reproduction to how they bore into wood and how they dispersed over wide distances. Her study of the worms took her around the world.         Working with Robert D. Ballard, who discovered the sunken liner Titanic in 1985, she identified mollusks as the reason so little wood remained in the wreck. She investigated dozens of other shipwrecks and appeared on National Geographic television specials to discuss deep-sea vent systems, the warm-water ecosystems caused by volcanic activity. She was named to the Women Divers Hall of Fame, sponsored by several organizations including the Women's Scuba Association and the Underwater Society of America.         In 1971, she was the first woman in the Alvin, the deep-sea submersible owned and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod. She was comfortable in the male-dominated society of ocean research, often enjoying poker with her male colleagues.         Her passion was mentoring researchers in the manner in which William J. Clench, her predecessor as mollusk curator at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, had inspired her. She was always ready to provide free room and board at her Cambridge home to a needy student.         ''Do what sets you on fire,'' Dr. Turner urged her students. ''If you do what you love, you'll succeed.''         Ruth Dixon Turner was born on Dec. 7, 1914, in Melrose, Mass. Her father was cabinet maker; her mother was a dressmaker. She had seven brothers and sisters. Two sisters, Winifred Garrity of Sudbury, Mass., and Lina MacNeil of Wayland, Mass., survive her.         She worked her way through Bridgewater State Teachers College, then took a job in a one-room schoolhouse in Vermont, the first of several teaching posts in New England. She worked for a short period at the New England Museum of Natural History, now the Boston Museum of Science.         In 1944, she earned a master's degree in ornithology from Cornell University. She then taught at Vassar and worked as a biologist at the Clapp Laboratory in Duxbury, Mass. Her next stop was Harvard, where she worked as a research assistant as she earned a doctorate in biology from Radcliffe in 1954.         She remained at Harvard as a research assistant and biology lecturer. When Dr. Clench invited her to lunch, she quickly became intrigued by mollusks. ''Things were not going well in the bird department,'' she later explained.         From 1963 to 1975, she was the Alexander Agassiz Fellow at the zoology museum. Since 1976, she has been a professor of biology. She also served as co-editor of the scientific journal Johnsonia.         A tiny woman with a strong jaw and equally strong opinions, she brought an easy grace to scientific expeditions, teaching others how to tie seaman's knots and sometimes cutting hair. She scuba dived until she was well into her 70's and went on her last expedition just two years ago. She never married.         The love of her life were the students she helped to understand science. She said this devotion came from a promise she had made to Dr. Clench.         ''When I asked Bill how I could return the kindness he'd given me, he said, 'You can't,' '' she said. '' 'Just do it for the next generation.' ''       
         Sybil Trent, a veteran of the golden age of radio and a star of the Saturday-morning children's radio show ''Let's Pretend,'' died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was lymphoma, said her son Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur.         Ms. Trent's voice was first heard on ''Let's Pretend'' in 1935, not long after she made her Broadway debut alongside Jimmy Durante, Gloria Grafton and Donald Novis, and atop an elephant, in Billy Rose's ''Jumbo,'' with songs by Rodgers and Hart,  at the Hippodrome Theater.         Over two decades, until the final broadcast of ''Let's Pretend'' in 1954, she entertained young listeners with renditions of princesses and fairy godmothers and found fame in her startlingly realistic ''baby cry.''         A precocious child, Ms. Trent began her career at the age of 3 1/2, when she performed in a short film with Fatty Arbuckle. Soon, she was singing and dancing her way through more than 25 shorts with stars like Ruth Etting and Jack Haley as a member of the Warner Brothers stock company.         Feature films at RKO followed, including ''The People's Enemy'' (1935) with Melvyn Douglas and Lila Lee, and ''Keep 'Em Rolling'' (1934) with Walter Huston.         By the age of 6, Ms. Trent was the host of her own radio show on WHN, ''Baby Sybil Elaine and Her Kiddie Revue,'' on which she would conjure  imitations of Joe Penner and the Block and Sully comedy team before closing with a sweetly sung ''Thank You for a Lovely Evening.''         One of the 150 charter members of the American Federation of Radio Artists, Ms. Trent also took the lead on ''We Love and Learn,'' ''Stella Dallas,'' ''Aunt Jenny'' and ''David Harum,'' and performed on shows like ''The Martha Raye Show,'' ''The Ed Sullivan Show''and Joe Franklin's ''Memory Lane.''         From 1973 to 1994, she was the casting director at the Young & Rubicam advertising agency in Manhattan.         Ms. Trent continued to do vocal work on commercials and in her spare time took reservations at her son's Manhattan restaurants.         ''The woman on the phone has the most delicious voice: low, slightly husky, completely inviting,'' Ruth Reichl wrote in 1994 in The New York Times of Ms. Trent's mellifluous tones. ''Just calling for a reservation makes you eager to eat at Montrachet.''         In addition to her son Drew, she is survived by another son, Tracy, and four grandchildren, all of New Jersey.       
         Elsie Widdowson, a nutritionist who used the discipline of wartime rationing to prescribe the healthiest diet in British history, died in Cambridge on June 14. She was 93.         The diet was an experimental plan for the goverment to promote for the citizens of Britain once its imports were impeded. Dr. Widdowson wrote it with her research partner of 60 years, Dr. R. A. McCance. It was based on bread, cabbage and potatoes, all of which were in relatively plentiful supply. Though aging British people, traditionally habitues of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, are most apt to remember the numbing taste of questionable delicacies like dried eggs, nutritionists say the lean, mean diet was the most nutritious the English ever forced down.         But that was only a small part of the legacy of the team known as ''Mac and Elsie.'' They profoundly affected how the world assessed nutritional values, how it investigated dietary deficiencies and how mammalian development was perceived. The two researchers would from time to time starve or overfeed volunteers of different age groups to study their metabolism. Their findings in the late 1930's on the body's need for salt became a key part of care for patients in diabetic comas and those with other ailments.         Along the way, they found time to do varied projects like studying the nutritional needs of concentration camp survivors and writing a medical journal article titled ''Food Lore From Nursery Rhymes.''         Working on her own at age 80, Dr. Widdowson chased seals on the Labrador ice floes to study their eating habits. A decade later, she published a paper on the physiology of the newborn bear.         Known for the twinkle in her eye, she kept generations of cats on her little farm, raised tomatoes, apples and bees, and ate lots of butter and eggs, which she considered good for people. Her sense of humor is suggested by her final advice after many an academic lecture: ''Take it with a grain of salt.''         She even gave the lie to the British maxim ''as different as chalk and cheese.'' To deal with the lack of calcium in people's diets because of a cheese shortage during World War II, she and Dr. McCance successfully pressed the government to add chalk to bread.         ''There is no branch of nutrition science, past or present, that has not been influenced in some way by the results of her pioneering work,'' a statement by the British Nutrition Foundation said, ''and because of the inspiration and encouragement she gave to nutrition scientists of all ages in the United Kingdom and overseas.''         Elsie May Widdowson was born and raised in Dulwich in Southeast London. She is survived by a younger sister, Eva Crane, who also became a noted scientist and for more than 30 years was director of the International Bee Research Association.         Their parents nourished the innate talent of the girls, who attended Sydenham County Secondary School. Elsie was one of the first women to graduate from Imperial College in London, where she studied chemistry. She also obtained her doctorate from Imperial, studying the chemistry of the compounds produced in ripening and stored fruit. She went to King's College in London to do postgraduate work on the subject.         She found herself spending time in hospital kitchens. She met a young doctor, Dr. McCance, who was studying the chemical consequences of cooking food. She realized his analyses of the carbohydrates in fruit were incorrect and told him so. He was delighted, and arranged a grant so she could work with him. Their collaboration continued until his death in 1993.         The initial step was combining her research on fruits and vegetables and his on meat, then collecting information on foods generally. The result was their 1940 book ''The Chemical Composition of Foods,'' which is known as the dietitian's bible and is now about to be published in its sixth edition.         With the onset of rationing, the two made guinea pigs of themselves and other scientists, living on questionable treats like Woolton Pie; it consisted of vegetables and bread crumbs and was named for Lord Woolton, the wartime Minister of Food, who fiercely promoted their very lean cuisine.         To prove the diet's effectiveness, the scientists decamped to the Lake District for vigorous exercise. In one day, they walked 36 miles and climbed 7,000 feet, burning 4,700 calories. They were none the worse for it. The only serious worry was a lack of calcium, a problem handled by adding ground chalk to bread flour.         After the war, Dr. Widdowson was asked to study how to treat the gross starvation suffered by survivors of Nazi concentration camps. She was then asked to study children in two German orphanages. She was amazed to find that children who had been given extra bread, jam and orange juice did worse in terms of development and growth than those who had not.         The difference, Dr. Widdowson surmised, could be explained only by the personality of the director at the orphanage where extra nutrition was provided. She was ''stern and forbidding, ruling the home with a rod of iron,'' Dr. Widdowson wrote. ''Children and staff lived in constant fear of her reprimands and criticisms, which were often quite unreasonable.''         It turned out that love was the healthiest food of all.       
         Joan Stoliar, a freelance book designer otherwise known as the den mother of New York fly-fishers, who took her love of pristine trout streams into city classrooms, died on June 18 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, Arthur.         Mrs. Stoliar's talents were in demand for books requiring special treatment for their illustrations or instructional materials. She also supplied the graphic designs for trade books by Richard Bach, James Clavell, Johnny Carson and the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, among others.         For Mr. Bach she designed his best sellers ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' (Macmillan, 1970), ''Illusions'' (Delacorte, 1977) and ''The Bridge Across Forever'' (Morrow, 1984). ''Illusions'' was the first book design to be copyrighted in its entirety.         At the behest of the mayor's office she created a commemorative volume in 1989 to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration. Later, she designed New York City's souvenir parade program for troops returning from the Persian Gulf war.         In her angler's incarnation, Mrs. Stoliar was a board member of the Manhattan-based Theodore Gordon Flyfishers and the founding director of their Trout in the Classroom program. It helps to outfit and maintain artifical tanks in a number of public schools in which children raise hatchling brown trout.         The students then release the fish in the streams of the city's upstate watersheds. The program was created to help make the children aware of the clear brooks and rivers in the Catskills and Hudson Valley.         Mrs. Stoliar also inspired the club's Project Access, a volunteer effort to build trails and access ramps at two trout streams in the Catskills. She enlisted the Department of Environmental Conservation and other interested parties to make selected fishing holes accessible to the disabled and elderly.         Born Joan Kramer in Brooklyn, Mrs. Stoliar graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1950 and worked as an art director at various publications before turning freelance. She frequently lectured on book design at publishers' seminars.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Stoliar is survived by a daughter, Lee Stoliar Dufresne of Charlotteville, N.J.; a son, Evan, of Manhattan; a sister, Dr. Virginia Stein of Somerville, N.J.; and a granddaughter.       
         Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings, Sussex. She was 92.         Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Ms. Atkins was widely believed to have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is said to have been the model for ''M.''         But Ms. Atkins's steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two were a far cry from Miss Moneypenny's lovestruck mooning over the elusive Bond. Ms. Atkins's heart was with her 400 secret agents. She stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into France.         After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a little worse than 1 in 4, Ms. Atkins pushed to be assigned to investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret service money.         ''I could not just abandon their memory,'' she said. ''I decided we must find out what happened to each one, and where.''         She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration camps and poring over records. ''I was probably the only person who could do this,'' she said. ''You had to know every detail of the agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their tracks.''         The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She always shuddered at Hoess's reaction to her suggestion that 1.5 million people had been killed in Auschwitz.         ''Oh no,'' he said, as if offended. ''It was 2,345,000.''         Ms. Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her mother's last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and her just as perfect manners would come in handy later.         At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations Executive, which Winston Churchill set up ''to set Europe ablaze'' through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, ''It was the equivalent of 15 divisions.''         Hitler said, ''When I get to London I am not sure who I shall hang first -- Churchill or that man Buckmaster.''         Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster's assistant, Ms. Atkins.         The spymasters headed the unit's F section, for France. They began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a 50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it.         The recruits were a remarkable cross-section -- bankers and playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French British citizens.         The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed by parachute training near Manchester.         They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up their cover stories by going over and over their false identities and backgrounds.         It was Ms. Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs, letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets.         At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French Service.         Ms. Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality, described by The Times of London as a ''sledgehammer,'' pervaded the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the brisk shout of a French expletive.         One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, ''Road to Resistance,''( Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his falling in love -- again. ''Oh, the bloody English!'' she said. ''We never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate, and that is that.''         Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous. So did Odette Sansom, who refused to talk even when the Gestapo pulled out her toenails one by one. She was the first woman awarded the George Cross and was the subject of a 1951 movie that took its title from her first name.         Ms. Atkins, who did not marry and has no known survivors, worked to keep the memory of the Resistance alive. She was appointed a Commandant of the Legion of Honor in 1987.         She traveled a great deal, but settled in a cottage left her by an aunt at Winchelsea, from which, on a clear day, you can see France.         Editors' Note:  July 14, 2000, Friday  An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times's research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications.         Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins's background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins's retirement. Although the London paper was cited as a source for some material, those five passages should also have been attributed to it, or should have been rephrased.       
         Ruth Rubin, a scholar, collector and performer of Yiddish folk songs who lugged a tape recorder into hundreds of immigrants' living rooms in an effort to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition, died on Sunday in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 93.         A resident of the Sarah R. Neumann Nursing Home, she formerly lived in Manhattan.         One of the first women to become a prominent folklorist, Mrs. Rubin was also among the first American scholars to document the culture of Eastern European Jews, anticipating by decades the Yiddish revival of the 1970's. Starting in the 1930's, she amassed a collection of about 2,000 songs -- love ballads, lullabies, songs of the factories and streets -- still considered unparalleled in its scope.         ''It is arguably the most important collection, because it's so early,'' said Steven Zeitlin, the director of City Lore, the New York Center for Urban Folk Culture. ''Much of the material dies with the succession of generations. She was collecting songs from the people that learned them in the old country.''         Mrs. Rubin, whose books included ''A Treasury of Jewish Folksong'' (1950) and ''Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish Folksong'' (1963), also performed the songs in concert and on records. Her studio recordings, first made for Folkways in the 1940's, are available through the Smithsonian Institution.         ''Eastern European Yiddish folk song,'' Mrs. Rubin wrote in the preface to ''Voices of a People,''  ''reflects vividly the life of a community of many millions over a period of many generations. In the songs, we catch the manner of speech and phrase, the wit and humor, the dreams and aspirations, the nonsense, jollity, the pathos and struggle of an entire people.''         Unlike klezmer music, which was performed primarily by men at public occasions, the songs Mrs. Rubin collected flourished in more intimate, domestic settings -- in the kitchen, over the cradle -- and were sung almost exclusively by women, a group largely ignored by the cultural chroniclers of her day.         ''While Irving Howe was writing 'World of Our Fathers,' she was, in a sense, at work on the world of our mothers,'' Mr. Zeitlin said.         Mrs. Rubin was born Rifke Rosenblatt in Montreal on Sept. 1, 1906, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia. As a young woman she moved to New York, with its swirling ferment of Yiddish music, literature and theater, and in 1929 published a volume of her own poems in Yiddish. In 1932 she married Harry Rubin, who died in 1971; the couple's only child, Michael, died in 1959. Mrs. Rubin is survived by a sister, Esther Spivack Marks, of Toronto.         In the mid-1930's Mrs. Rubin began to concentrate seriously on folklore, going on to study with the eminent Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich and, during World War II, translating diaries smuggled out of ghettos and Nazi camps. With the end of the war and the revelation of the extent of the Holocaust, and of its sweeping destruction of Yiddish culture, Mrs. Rubin became even more determined to preserve a piece of what remained by making field recordings.         Dragging her bulky reel-to-reel tape recorder from house to house in cities in Canada and the United States, she captured well-known songs like ''Roizhinkes Mit Mandeln'' (''Raisins and Almonds'') and lesser-known material like ''A Brivele der Maman'' (''A Little Letter to Mama'') and ''Oy, di lumpn /zey zenen shpionen'' (''Oh, the lumpen /  they are spies'').         In the last decades of the 20th century, Mrs. Rubin's work was a cornerstone of the Yiddish revival movement. With an older generation of Jewish singers dying off, young musicians who wanted to learn Yiddish folksongs turned to her books and records. Mrs. Rubin's field recordings are now housed in various collections, including the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.         Mrs. Rubin earned a Ph.D. in 1976 from Union Graduate School in Cleveland, writing her dissertation on the songs of Jewish women. She received an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music and YIVO's Lifetime Achievement Award, among other honors.         Although she performed in prestigious concert halls like Town Hall and the Carnegie Recital Hall, Mrs. Rubin regarded these appearances not as recitals but as links in a chain of cultural transmission she hoped would stretch far into the future.         ''She didn't try and put on any great airs,'' recalled the folk singer Pete Seeger, a longtime friend who occasionally performed with her. ''She just sang a song very simply. She was mainly interested in seeing that the song got out so that other people would learn it and sing.''       
         Nancy Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled at playing wise and imperious authority figures -- newspaper publishers, queens, grande dames and a madam -- and who achieved perhaps her greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss in the television series ''The Sopranos,''  died on Sunday at her home in Stratford, Conn., one day short of her 72nd birthday. She also had a home in Manhattan.         Her daughter Katie Sparer Bowe said that no specific cause of death was given, but for several years the actress had been suffering from cancer and chronic pulmonary disease.         A wide diversity of playwrights -- among them Chekhov, Shaw and  Shakespeare as well as Jean Genet, Paul Osborn and A. R. Gurney -- was within Ms. Marchand's range. She once described her physical presence as ''a strange combination of being very imposing and down-to-earth,'' an accurate assessment of the seemingly contradictory image she projected.         That description could be applied to the overburdened wife she played in the 1980 Broadway revival of Osborn's ''Morning's at Seven,'' the patrician publisher on the long-running ''Lou Grant'' television series and her portrayal of Livia Soprano, the monster mother of them all, a woman bred into the Mafia who without a blink of hesitation sets up her son Tony to be assassinated because he has moved her to a nursing home.         Except for her indomitability, Livia was in direct contrast to all the ''tasteful ladies'' Ms. Marchand  played in her busy career. At 70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of Caligula's great-grandmother in ''I, Claudius,'' a woman who also happened to be named Livia.         Throughout her career, Ms. Marchand gave her roles an unexpected edge. Even when her characters were at their most officious, they retained a measure of charm, and her more affectionate characters could also be sardonic. She was an expert at both light and more serious comedy, moving effortlessly from the outrageous antics in the movie spoof ''The Naked Gun,'' to Lady Bracknell in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''         In plays like ''Morning's at Seven,'' she warmed an audience's collective heart, but she never wore her own heart on her sleeve, avoiding the cul de sac of sentimentality. Instead she was wily in performance, turning in an instant from comedy to poignance.         Often she acted onstage with her husband, Paul Sparer -- in everything from ''A Phoenix Too Frequent'' by Christopher Fry to Edward Albee's ''Delicate Balance'' to Mr. Gurney's ''Love Letters.'' Mr. Sparer also had his own rewarding career in plays that included Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God'' and ''The Burnt Flowerbed'' by Ugo Betti. Individually and together they were ultimate theatrical professionals.         Mr. Sparer died in November. In addition to her daughter Katie, an actress who lives in Stratford, Ms. Marchand is survived by a son, David of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Rachel Sparer Bersier, an opera singer of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.         Offstage, Ms. Marchand was the reverse of so many of her strong-willed characters, a woman with a natural sense of insecurity, someone who felt uneasy in social situations. ''I'm always very uncomfortable with people.'' she once explained in an interview in The New York Times. ''It's something that I get upset with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And  when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe. There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can experience and share when I'm on a stage.''         Her roles, she said, were more a question of chance than choice. But whatever she was called on to do, even if it meant being as malevolent as Livia Soprano, she did it with enthusiasm. As always, she was captivated by her profession. Looking back on her career, she said, ''Acting was something I had to do.''         Nancy Marchand was born in Buffalo on June 19, 1928. After studying theater at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, she made her first professional appearance onstage in 1946 in ''The Late George Apley'' in Ogunquit, Me. It was while acting in Shakespeare and Shaw at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., that she met -- and then married -- Mr. Sparer. When they moved to New York, she appeared on live television, playing Jo in a dramatization of ''Little Women,'' and then playing the female lead opposite Rod Steiger in the original television version of Paddy Chayefsky's ''Marty.''         In 1957 she made her Broadway debut in ''Miss Isobel,'' and two years later won an Obie award for her role as Madame Irma in the Off Broadway premiere of ''The Balcony'' by Genet. For several years she played leading Shakespearean roles with the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. As an original member of the A.P.A. theater company (formally the Association of Producing Artists), she was Lady Sneerwell in ''The School for Scandal,'' Arkadina in ''The Seagull,'' Dona Ana in ''Man and Superman'' and other classic characters.         Continuing her devotion to repertory theater, she joined the theater at Lincoln Center to act in plays by Schiller (Queen Elizabeth in ''Mary Stuart''), Gorky and Sean O'Casey (''The Plough and the Stars'' with Jack MacGowran).         Ms. Marchand worked with equal ease on Broadway, off Broadway and in regional theater, as well as in movies and on television. In the 1980's she played the title role in Christopher Durang's ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' Bessie Berger in Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing'' at Circle in the Square, Klytemnestra in Ezra Pound's ''Elektra'' and the august mother in ''The Cocktail Hour'' by Mr. Gurney.         In the following decade, she moved on to Jon Robin Baitz's ''End of the Day'' at Playwrights Horizons, and, in 1993, acted in a double header of Peter Shaffer plays, ''Black Comedy'' and ''White Liars,'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. That same year she also played the wicked stepmother in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' at the New York City Opera.         Her movie appearances included ''The Hospital''; two films with the team of Merchant Ivory, ''The Bostonians'' and ''Jefferson in Paris'';  and the remake of ''Sabrina,'' in which she played Harrison Ford's mother. When she played Mrs. Pynchon, the publisher of The Los Angeles Tribune on ''Lou Grant,'' the role became a keystone of her career; for it she won four Emmy awards. Some years later on television's ''Spearfield's Daughter,'' she switched cities and became the publisher of The New York Courier.         When Ms. Marchand played Livia Soprano on ''The Sopranos,'' television viewers wondered how her son Tony, played by James Gandolfini, and his wife (Edie Falco) could put up with her malice and her prejudices. The answer, of course, was that there was nothing much they could do against this self-dramatizing force of nature.         At the end of the show's first season, Tony was about to smother his mother with a pillow, but a stroke got there first and she was left gasping for breath in a hospital bed. David Chase, the creator of the Home Box Office series, said yesterday that he always planned to bring Livia back for a second year. He added that he was impressed by Ms. Marchand's  courage as she continued to perform despite her illness.         When that season ended, Ms. Marchand said she was looking forward to the second round: ''Who knows what lurks in the mind of Livia?'' Viewers soon found out: more of the same.         During the last show of the second season, there was a sudden twist in the narrative. Tony gave his mother airline tickets so that she and his aunt could fly to Arizona. Before she could get on the plane, Livia was stopped by men from airport security. The tickets were stolen property. Frantically, she telephoned her son.         Because filming on the third season of ''Sopranos'' was not scheduled to begin until Aug. 1, that scene represents Ms. Marchand's final performance: about to be arrested and furious at Tony for putting her in that predicament. Mr. Chase would not discuss forthcoming events in the series, but if the actress had lived, undoubtedly the mother and son battle would have continued and Livia Soprano would have had the last word.         Correction:  June 21, 2000, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand yesterday misidentified Livia, a Roman historical figure, in some copies. Livia, to whom Ms. Marchand compared her television role as Livia in ''The Sopranos,'' was the great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula, not his mother.         A page one reference to the obituary misstated the character's name as Lydia in some copies.         Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand on Tuesday misstated the title of a Peter Shaffer play in which she appeared with the Roundabout Theater Company in 1993. It is ''White Lies,'' not ''White Liars.''       
         Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial equality in her native South Africa,  died at home in London on Monday, her literary agent, Felicity Bryan, said. She was 80.         Miss Benson's books included a novel, ''At the Still Point,'' and biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the time, written while Mr. Mandela was still serving his long prison term and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In her memoir, ''A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Miss Benson told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.         Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the cause in London.         It was Miss Benson whom Mr. Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when, after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support in West and East Africa, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the door, Mr. Mandela was standing beside him.         ''I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,'' Miss Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mr. Mandela paced up and down her apartment, brimming with ideas. ''He talked so excitedly and with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''         Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo ship as a teenager, using a mix of charm and determination to win interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she then wrote.         Restless and daring, Miss Benson served as an aide to various British generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming secretary to the director David Lean.         It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' that Miss Benson saw her country with new eyes and discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a correspondence with Mr. Paton (she was also to develop intense correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans. She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom she fell in love.         Miss Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of the defense fund for the 156 people, Mr. Mandela among them, who had been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her life, Miss Benson turned her attention to writing. When the African National Congress was banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mr. Mandela when he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a car in which he posed as her chauffeur.         Among Miss Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed African National Congress, published in the United States as ''South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials that resulted in long prison terms for the A.N.C.'s members, Miss Benson was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years -- for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed -- but continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990's. She never married.         Among other projects, Miss Benson also edited Athol Fugard's ''Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She was also the author of ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater.''         On the occasion of Miss Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mr. Mandela sent a message from South Africa. ''It reminds me of all the great help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he wrote. ''I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous friendship over half a lifetime.''         Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about the South African writer Mary Benson misstated the title of one of her books. It is ''Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater,'' not ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith.''       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Sally Kovalchick, editor in chief of Workman Publishing Company, who supervised the publication of some notable best-selling books, died on Saturday at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 61.         The cause apparently was a heart attack, a company statement said.         Ms. Kovalchick spent 26 years at Workman, was a senior editor and then became editor in chief several years ago. She oversaw the publication of about 15 books that became best sellers by the company's count, including ''The Official Preppy Handbook.''         ''She quietly gave birth to enormous best sellers that achieved cult status,'' said Peter Workman, the company's chief executive. ''She had a great publishing gut'' -- an instinct for what books would be successful, he said. ''Her particular talent was to make books better, to get the most out of authors and their subjects.''         Ms. Kovalchick specialized in humorous books. In a 1990 interview she said: ''Parodies are always good. We look for a subject, and for the joke. Our authors usually submit complete manuscripts. Once in a while we have a funny idea but can't figure out what to do with it. The hard part is that everyone copies us.''         Mr. Workman said it was Ms. Kovalchick who nurtured ''The Official Preppy Handbook,'' a 224-page work of humor, into being. Published in 1980, the book was the joint handiwork of four preppies in their mid-20's who were all Ivy League college graduates: Jonathan Roberts, Lisa Birnbach, Carol McD. Wallace and Mason Wiley. A tongue-in-cheek guidebook to ''living the elite and proper life of Prep,'' the book was true enough and funny enough to reach the top of what was then called The New York Times's trade paperback best-seller list of Jan. 4, 1981, for the second successive week and remain on the list for 65 weeks all told.         Ms. Kovalchick also oversaw the publication of ''Cat'' (1975), a best-selling collection of cartoons of cats by B. Kliban. One ''Cat'' cartoon  pictured a guitar-playing feline singing: ''Love to eat them mousies. Mousies what I love to eat. Bite they little heads off . . . nibble on they tiny feet.'' Within a few years, the Kliban cats began appearing on calendars, greeting cards and other products, becoming a $50 million industry in the mid-1980's. Workman published most of the 10 Kliban books.         Another best-selling book ushered into print by Ms. Kovalchick was ''The Dieter's Guide to Weight Loss During Sex'' (1978), by Richard Smith.         The publishing projects she supervised in her later years included ''1001 Ways to Reward Employees'' (1994) by Bob Nelson. Workman says more than a million copies of it have been sold.         Another later project of hers was the Brain Quest series of question-and-answer games in card deck form for children through seventh grade.         Ms. Kovalchick was born in Indiana, Pa., and graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.         She is survived by two sisters, Becky Rankin of Monroeville, Pa. and Millie Glinsky of Indiana, Pa.;  and a brother, Joseph, also of Indiana.       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Sally Amato, a singer and actress who founded the Amato Opera with her husband, the conductor Anthony Amato, died on Wednesday at her home in City Island in the Bronx. She was 82.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Amato was in many ways the welcoming face of her family-run opera company. An operagoer was greeted by her at the door of the tiny Amato theater on the Bowery, and would then proceed down a flight of stairs or into the balcony, where Mr. Amato would conduct, stopping at intermission to draw raffles out of a barrel and award prizes to audience members. The company became a home for enthusiasts on both sides of the footlights: amateur singers (and some who became professionals) go there to learn and perform the great works and occasional rarities, and opera lovers on tight budgets go there to hear their favorite scores.         Mrs. Amato was born Serafina Bellantone in Manhattan in 1917. She began her performing career as a child, when she and her sisters performed vaudeville skits in movie theaters, and she continued to work as an actress and singer into the first decades of the Amato Opera, which she and her husband started in 1948.         She met Mr. Amato in 1943, when they were both performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. The meeting itself was not auspicious: Mr. Amato and Ms. Bellantone had been cast as American Indians, and in one scene Mr. Amato was to throw his future wife to the floor and kick her. But she was charmed by his expressions of concern when the scene ended. She also said that she admired his tenor voice.         The Amatos married in 1945, and continued to work together at the American Theater Wing, where Mr. Amato directed workshops. They also shared an abiding love of opera, and it occurred to them soon after World War II that a company was needed to provide opportunities for aspiring singers returning from military service. The Amato Opera gave its first performances in the basement of Our Lady of Pompeii Church in Greenwich Village. The company later moved to 159 Bleecker Street; in 1963 it took over the jewel box theater at the corner of the Bowery and Second Street that has been its home ever since.         Mrs. Amato performed with the company under her maiden name for several seasons, but she increasingly took on many of the house's nonmusical jobs. She made many of the company's costumes, ran its box office, and operated its lighting board.         Mrs. Amato is survived by her husband and a sister, Ann Frydel, of Manhattan.       
         Mary Colquhoun, a versatile, award-winning casting director, died on Sept. 10 in Manhattan. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Carol Fineman, general press representative of the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival.         Ms. Colquhoun (pronounced cull-HOON) received many honors, including the Casting Society of America's Hoyt Bowers Award for lifetime achievement. She was involved in more than 80 films, television productions and Broadway and Off Broadway plays.         Her work won Emmy awards for two HBO television films: ''Citizen Cohn,'' about Roy Cohn, in 1993, and ''Truman'' in 1996.         Ms. Colquhoun and Irene Lamb assembled what Variety called a ''top drawer'' cast for the film ''The Man who Cried,'' about a displaced Jewish girl from Russia. It was directed and written by Sally Potter and shown at the Venice Film Festival this month.         Ms. Colquhoun, who was born in London, also handled casting for the movies ''Glory,'' ''Sea of Love'' and ''A Shock to the System.'' Among the Broadway plays in which she was involved were '' 'Night, Mother'' and ''Passion.''         She is survived by a sister, Christina Burke; a brother, Patrick Burke; a niece, Tawny Wagner; and three nephews, Toby Wagner, Matthew Burke and Laurence Burke. All live in England.       
         Paula Yates,  a British television personality known for her outrageously flirtatious interviewing style and for her relationships with the rock stars Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence, was found dead at home here on Sunday. She was 40.         The cause was apparently a drug overdose, the authorities said.         Reared in north Wales, Ms. Yates left school at 16 and moved to London, where she joined the emerging punk scene and embarked on an extravagant -- and extravagantly public -- life. When she became enamored of Mr. Geldof, who was then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, she followed the band on tour until Mr. Geldof became just as smitten with her, and they embarked on a relationship. They married 10 years later and had three daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie.         Ms. Yates reveled in the spotlight, posing naked in the stuffy Reform Club for Penthouse magazine and compiling a book of photographs called ''Rock Stars in Their Underpants,'' which Andy Warhol called ''the greatest work of art in the last decade.'' She also wrote several books for children, but it was not until she started her television career as a co-presenter of ''The Tube,'' a show about music, that she became a celebrity in her own right, affecting a bubbleheaded, giggly personality that belied her sharp intelligence, friends said.         In 1992 she began presenting ''The Big Breakfast Show,'' a morning television program in which she often interviewed guests while lying on a bed in the studio. One guest was Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the band INXS, and the two fell madly in love. She left Mr. Geldof, setting off a bitter, tabloid-fueled divorce and an equally bitter fight for custody of their three daughters. Mr. Geldof won.         Ms. Yates and Mr. Hutchence had an intensely passionate affair and one child, a daughter they named Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. But their relationship was marred by drug use and extreme behavior that ended when Mr. Hutchence was found dead, hanging by his belt, in a hotel room in Sydney, Australia, in November 1997.         Ms. Yates, who once said that Mr. Hutchence was ''God's gift to women,'' seemed never to recover from his death, spiraling into a depression that resulted in her admission to a mental hospital and at least one suicide attempt of her own.         It was hard for her to hang on, she once said in an interview. ''It's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day,'' she said. ''Right now, I think living is a noble gesture.''       
         Ann Doran, a character actress who appeared in hundreds of movies and television shows over the course of a career that began during the silent film era and lasted into the 1980's, died on Sept. 19 in Carmichael, Calif. She was 89.         Ms. Doran's more memorable roles included a panicky passenger aboard a disabled airliner in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954), whose cast included John Wayne and Claire Trevor, and James Dean's tormented mother in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (1955). She was a regular in the series of films based on the comic strip ''Blondie,'' which starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake.         Her film credits also included  ''Penny Serenade,'' with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne; ''Here Come the Waves,'' with Bing Crosby and Betty Hutton; ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,'' with Barbara Stanwyck and Van Heflin; ''My Favorite Brunette,'' with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour; and ''No Sad Songs for Me,'' with Margaret Sullavan.         Ms. Doran, who was born in Amarillo, Tex., was the daughter of Carrie Barnett, an actress who appeared in silent films and had her child performing in front of the cameras almost as soon as she could walk. By the time Ms. Doran reached her 20's, she was ready for any role that came her way.       
         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Janice Brustlein, whose painting career, pursued under the name Biala, spanned two art capitals and several generations, died on Sept. 24 at her home in Paris. She was 97 and had lived in Paris since 1958.         She was known for cryptic, lusciously painted interiors, still lifes, landscapes and street scenes that hovered between abstraction and representation. They belonged to a trans-Atlantic tradition that included French painters like Matisse, Bonnard and Marquet, as well as Milton Avery and Edward Hopper. She might also be grouped with artists like Loren MacIver, Fairfield Porter and Anne Poor, who borrowed from the abstract tendencies of the New York School while concentrating on their immediate surroundings.         Always carrying a sketchbook, Biala drew her subjects from her homes and studios, the cities she lived in and the places she visited, including Cape Cod, Venice, the French Riviera and Fire Island. Although she preferred to live in Paris, her career was based in New York, where she had regular gallery shows beginning in the 1940's.         Biala was described by her niece, the New York painter Hermine Ford,  as a ''uniquely wonderful, widely beloved character'' whose house in Paris ''would fill in the late afternoon with all kinds of people -- writers, artists, next-door neighbors.'' Her close friends included the photographer Cartier-Bresson, as well as the expatriate American painter Shirley Jaffe. She knew literary Paris as well, having lived there with the English novelist Ford Madox Ford from the late 1920's until his death in 1939, during which time she illustrated some of his novels.         Biala rarely revisited her complicated past -- refusing several offers from potential biographers -- and as a result its facts are not always clear. Neither Ms. Ford, or her sister Helen Tworkov, a founding editor of Tricycle magazine, remember the name their aunt was given at birth.  She was born in 1903, the daughter of a Jewish tailor named Tworkovsky in Biala, a village on the Russian-Polish border. Her father soon left for New York, where he set up a shop on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side; Biala, her mother and her older brother Jacob, who would become the Abstract Expressionist painter Jack Tworkov, followed in 1913.         While both nieces contend that Biala knew she wanted to be a painter from a very early age (before her brother did, in fact), all they know of her artistic education is that at the age of 18 or 19, after a brief period of study at the National Academy of Design, she went to Provincetown, Mass., to study with the painter Edwin Dickinson, whose painterly representation was especially influential on her work. By then she was already living on her own, supporting herself with menial jobs and becoming familiar with Greenwich Village bohemia. Sometime in the mid-1920's she was briefly married to the painter Lee Gatch. After that, a wealthy couple interested in art paid her expenses on a trip to Paris, where she met Ford and became a Francophile.         In 1943, having returned to New York, Biala married Daniel Brustlein, an Alsatian-born painter who contributed cartoons to The New Yorker under the name Alain. Over the next 15 years the couple split their time between Paris and New York. (The McCarran Act did not permit naturalized citizens to live abroad for more than two years at a time.) Their New York circle included Jack and Wally Tworkov, Harold and May Rosenberg, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Saul Steinberg and Hedda Sterne and Rudy Burckhardt. Mr. Brustlein died in 1996.         Biala's first exhibition was at the Passedoit Gallery in Manhattan in 1936, by which point, it is thought, she had already taken the name of her birthplace. She exhibited at the Stable Gallery, an important artists' cooperative, in 1954, 1956 and 1961. In the 1970's and 80's she was represented by the Gruenebaum Gallery in New York and in the 1990's by the Kouros Gallery, where she had her most recent show in 1999.         Despite her love of Paris, Biala never gave up her United States citizenship. She was at home everywhere. ''I never have the feeling of nationality or roots,'' she once said. ''I always had the feeling that I belong where my easel is.''       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Mary Hunter Wolf, one of the first female directors on Broadway, died Nov. 3 in Hamden, Conn. She was 95.         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., and orphaned as a teenager, Ms. Hunter (who took the name Wolf after marrying Herman Wolf in 1955) discovered her love of the theater while a student at the Hollywood School for Girls. There she formed a lifelong friendship with the choreographer Agnes de Mille, a classmate.         She spent the summer after graduation working as a script girl for de Mille's father, William, at Laske Studios before heading to Wellesley College. During her third year at Wellesley, she visited her aunt, the writer Mary Austin, in Santa Fe, N.M., where she was introduced into the circle of D. H. Lawrence, Lynn Riggs, Sinclair Lewis and Willa Cather, whom she chauffeured around while Cather wrote ''Death Comes for the Archbishop.''         She soon abandoned her studies to forge a directing career, beginning with a staging of a 17th-century Spanish verse play, ''Los Morros y los Cristianos,'' performed on horseback. In 1928, she moved to Chicago, where she enrolled at the University of Chicago and started working with the Cube Theater, the first interracial company in Chicago. Once again, she dropped out of college to take over the theater, directing such plays as ''The Dreamy Kid,'' ''The Man Who Died at 12:00'' and ''Plumes,'' in which Katherine Dunham made her dramatic debut.         In 1931, she won the part of Marge on the WGN radio comedy ''Easy Aces.'' Two years later, she moved with the show to New York, where it was broadcast on CBS until 1945, and resumed her college studies, earning a degree in anthropology from Columbia University.         In 1938, Ms. Hunter and a Stanislavsky student, Andrius Jilinsky, founded the American Actors Company, an early Off Broadway ensemble whose members included de Mille, Jerome Robbins, Mildred Dunnock, Horton Foote, Joseph Anthony, Perry Wilson and Jean Stapleton.         ''Mary was largely instrumental in getting me interested in playwriting and was kind of my mentor,'' Mr. Foote said Friday.         ''I was doing some improvisation about Texas, and she asked me if I had ever thought about writing, which I hadn't,'' he recalled. ''And so, at her urging, I put some things down on paper, and it sort of went from there.''         Ms. Hunter made her Broadway debut directing the 1944 production of Mr. Foote's ''Only the Heart.'' The next year, she directed ''Carib Song,'' the first black Broadway musical, starring Dunham. She went on to direct Riggs's ''Out of Dust,'' John LaTouche and Jerome Moross's ''Ballet Ballads'' and a successful run of Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Respectful Prostitute,'' both on Broadway and on tour. Alongside her close friend Robbins, she was associate director of ''Peter Pan,'' starring Mary Martin.         In 1947, Ms. Hunter was hired to direct a new Broadway musical, ''High Button Shoes,'' but the show's producers dismissed her before rehearsals began, replacing her with George Abbott. She sued, arguing that her contract had been canceled because she was a woman. Two years later the New York Supreme Court decided in her favor.         At the close of World War II, Ms. Hunter established the Professional Training Program of the American Theater Wing, under which 1,700 students studied under the G.I. Bill of Rights. In 1952 she helped Lawrence Langner found the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., serving first as executive director and later as associate producer.         She and Mr. Wolf were divorced in 1965. He survives her, as do two stepsons, David Wolf of Ridgefield, Wash., and Bill Wolf of New Castle, Va.; a stepdaughter, Louise Chandler of Sweet Springs, W.Va.; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson.       
         Florynce Kennedy, a lawyer and political activist whose flamboyant attire and sometimes outrageous comments drew attention to her fierce struggle for civil rights and feminism, died on Thursday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Known to everyone as Flo, recognizable everywhere in cowboy hat and pink sunglasses, she was one of the first black women to graduate from Columbia Law School, where she was admitted after threatening a discrimination suit. She fought in the courts and on the streets for abortion rights, represented Black Panthers, was a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and led a mass urination by women protesting a lack of women's restrooms at Harvard.         ''If you found a cause for the downtrodden of somebody being abused someplace, by God, Flo Kennedy would be there,'' former Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said yesterday.         People magazine in 1974 called her ''the biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground where feminist activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause.''         Justice Emily Jane Goodman of New York State Supreme Court said Ms. Kennedy gave women courage. ''She showed a whole generation of us the right way to live our lives,'' Justice Goodman said.         Friends like Gloria Steinem reveled in her razor-sharp wit. Ms. Steinem, who lectured with Ms. Kennedy in the 1970's, said a man in the audience would all too often stand up and demand, ''Are you lesbians?''         Ms. Kennedy would respond that it depended. ''Are you my alternative?'' she would ask.         Ms. Steinem said by phone from Hawaii yesterday, ''She understood what Emma Goldman understood: there has to be laughter and fun at the revolution, or it isn't a revolution.''         Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, yesterday called Ms. Kennedy ''one of the most wonderfully outrageous pioneers of feminism in America.''         Florynce Rae Kennedy, the second of five daughters, was born on Feb. 11, 1916, in Kansas City, Mo. Her father was a Pullman porter and later owned a taxi business. He once stood up with a shotgun to members of the Ku Klux Klan who wanted to drive him from a home he had bought in a mainly white neighborhood.         In her autobiography, ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'' (1976), she said her parents almost never criticized their daughters. In fact, they could seemingly do almost no wrong. ''We were taught very early in the game that we didn't have to respect the teachers, and if they threatened to hit us, we could act as if they weren't anybody we had to pay any attention to,'' she wrote.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Kennedy opened a hat shop in Kansas City with her sisters. Within a few years, she was involved in her first political protest, helping organize a boycott when the local Coca-Cola bottler refused to hire black truck drivers.         After the death of her mother, Zella, from cancer, Ms. Kennedy and her sister Grayce moved to New York. Ignoring those who urged her to become a teacher, she enrolled in pre-law courses at Columbia University. ''I find that the higher you aim, the better you shoot,'' she wrote.         She applied to Columbia Law School, but was refused admission. She was told the reason was not that she was black, but that she was a woman. Justice Goodman said she answered, ''To my friends at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, it all sounds the same.''         After threatening a lawsuit, Ms. Kennedy was admitted. She was one of eight women and the only black in her class. She graduated in 1951 and worked briefly for a Manhattan law firm before opening her own law office in 1954. Business was not good, and she had to take a job at Bloomingdale's one Christmas to pay the rent.         One of her cases involved representing the estates of the jazz greats Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker to recover money owed them by record companies. Even though she won the cases, the experience soured her on the law.         ''Handling the Holiday and Parker estates taught me more than I was really ready for about government and business delinquency and the hostility and helplessness of the courts,'' she wrote. ''Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practicing law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.''         She turned to political activism, setting up an organization called the Media Workshop in 1966 to fight racism in journalism and advertising. Picketing an advertising agency led to the protesters' being invited upstairs to state their case. She said, ''Ever since I've been able to say, 'When you want to get to the suites, start in the streets.' ''         Her strategy became to go after the biggest targets possible. ''Grass-roots organizing is like climbing into bed with a malaria patient in order to show how much you love him or her, then catching malaria yourself,'' she wrote. ''I say if you want to kill poverty, go to Wall Street and kick -- or disrupt.''         Increasingly, her legal cases were almost always political. ''Sweetie,'' she said, ''if you're not living on the edge, then you're taking up space.''         In 1966, she represented H. Rap Brown, the civil rights leader. In 1968, she sued the Roman Catholic Church for what she viewed as interference with abortion. In 1969, she organized a group of feminist lawyers to challenge the constitutionality of New York State's abortion law, an action credited with helping influence the Legislature to liberalize abortion the next year.         In 1969, she helped represent 21 Black Panthers on trial in Manhattan for conspiracy to commit bombings, among other things. They were eventually acquitted, but during the trial she used them for another purpose.         She and Ms. Goodman, not then a judge, and others were renting a house on Fire Island. They decided to take the Panthers to a community on the island for a dinner at a restaurant that did not accept blacks or Jews. It created quite a commotion, the intended effect. But afterward, Ms. Goodman asked if it was all that important, compared with the life and death issues at stake in the trial.         Ms. Kennedy gave an emphatic yes. ''Her point was that you have to fight on all the fronts all the time,'' Justice Goodman said.         Other fronts included founding the Feminist Party in 1971. Its first act was to nominate Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of New York, for president.         In 1967, Ms. Kennedy attended a rally against the Vietnam War in Montreal. Bobby Seale, the Black Panther, was not allowed to speak. ''I went berserk,'' she wrote. ''I took the platform and started yelling and hollering.'' An invitation for Ms. Kennedy to speak in Washington followed, and a 20-year lecturing career was born. She made $3,500 a lecture at her peak.         Ms. Steinem called her lectures with Ms. Kennedy on the college circuit ''the Thelma and Louise of the 70's.'' Ms. Steinem said, ''I definitely speak first because after Flo I would have been an anticlimax.''         In 1957, Ms. Kennedy married Charles Dye, a writer 10 years her junior. He died a few years later. ''Anyone who marries a drunk Welshman doesn't deserve sympathy,'' she once said.         Her views on the exclusivity of marriage were not much brighter. ''Why would you lock yourself in the bathroom just because you have to go three times a day,'' she wrote.         Ms. Kennedy is survived by three sisters, Joy Kennedy Banks of East Orange, N.J., Faye Kennedy Daly of Honolulu and Grayce Kennedy Bayles of Queens.         As her health failed, her spirit did not. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stopped to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.''
