         Elizabeth Cadwell Dance, who was prominent in volunteer work in the Detroit area, died Thursday at Bon Secours Hospital in Grosse Pointe, Mich. She was 67 and lived in Grosse Pointe.         Her daughter, Elizabeth Ellen Dance, said she died of lung cancer.         Mrs. Dance was a former president and chairman of the Sigma Gamma Association, a women's volunteer group in the Detroit area. Her half century of volunteer work also included service on the board of the United Community Services in Detroit.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Washington, she is survived by her husband, William Henry Dance; two sons, Theodore Marsh Dance of Lake Worth, Fla., and William Henry Dance Jr. of Santa Monica, Calif., and a sister, Lorraine Dibble of Naugatuck, Conn.       
         Martha Dalrymple, a co-author of an exhaustive study of New York City landmarks, died on Monday in Portland, Ore., where she had moved 17 years ago. She was 89.         The cause of death was chronic lung disease and heart failure, said her half-sister, Joanna Stuart of Portland.         With Harmon H. Goldstone, a former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miss Dalrymple wrote "History Preserved: A Guide to New York City Landmarks and Historic Districts" (1974). The book included city landmarks dating from 1650 to 1930.         Mr. Goldstone, an architect, was a major force in establishing the Landmarks Commission and served as its chairman from 1968 to 1973. Miss Dalrymple worked for several years as a volunteer for the commission, and their collaboration on the 576-page volume was a result.         She was a 1925 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and began her career as a journalist. She worked for The Chicago Journal and then for The Associated Press, reporting from New York City, Washington, London, Rome and Moscow. She was hired by Nelson A. Rockefeller for the Office of Inter-American Affairs, for which he was the coordinator. She also wrote a history of the American International Association for Economic and Social Development, entitled "The A.I.A. Story: Two Decades of International Cooperation" (1968).       
         Frances Cullman Boas, a founder and trustee of the Gomez Foundation for Mill House, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mill House, in Marlboro, N.Y., is believed to be the oldest extant house built by a Jewish family in America.  The stone first story was constructed in 1714 by one of Mrs. Boas's ancestors, Louis Moses Gomez, as a home and trading post for his fur trade with the Indians. In 1772, it was bought by Wolfert Acker, who added a second story of brick.         Mrs. Boas was an enthusiastic angler, skilled at fly fishing for trout and salmon. She was the daughter of Joseph F. Cullman Jr. and Frances Wolff Cullman. Her father was a merchant of tobacco, cigars and cigarettes. Mrs. Boas's brother, Joseph Cullman 3d of Manhattan, is chairman emeritus of Philip Morris Companies.         Another brother, Edgar, also of Manhattan, is chairman of the Culbro Corporation of Manhattan, a diversified products company. Her brother Lewis, of Manhattan, is president of Cullman Ventures Inc., a private holding company.         Her husband, Percy E. Boas, a cotton broker, died in 1982.         Besides her three brothers, Mrs. Boas is survived by two daughters, Frances Jacobs Frawley and Barbara Jacobs Tamerin, both of Manhattan; a son, Robert Allen Jacobs Jr., of Westport, Conn.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Marka Truesdale duPont, a patron of mental-health groups and the performing arts, died Tuesday at her home in Wilmington, Del. She was 82.         She had had a prolonged illness, her family said.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Chapin School. As a young woman, she worked for the Henry Street Settlement Theater.         Moving to Vermont in 1942, she became publisher and editor of The Burlington Daily News. During her tenure it won an award from Editor and Publisher magazine for exposing squalid conditions at a reform school for boys and at the state mental hospital in Waterbury.         Later, in Delaware, she was the founding chairman of that state's Mental Health Association and an officer and fund-raiser in the National Association for Mental Health, of which she was a past president.         Mrs. duPont's first marriage, to Grover Loening, an aviation designer with Orville Wright, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, A. Felix duPont Jr., a member of the duPont family of Wilmington; two daughters by her previous marriage, Louise Truesdale Loening of Landenberg, Pa., and Priscilla Loening Hanford of Paradise, Calif.; a son, Christopher T. duPont of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepson, Michael Hoyt duPont of Union, Wash.; a stepdaughter, Katharine duPont Gahagan of Wilmington, and a sister, Anne Truesdale Broadhurst of Wilton, Conn.       
         Dr. Monica Healea, physics professor emeritus and former chairman of the physics department at Vassar College, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 93.         Dr. Healea, who was born in Uhrichsville, Ohio, was a resident of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., until nine years ago. She earned her B.A. and M.A. degrees at Bryn Mawr College and held a Ph.D. from Harvard University. She joined the Vassar faculty in 1933 and retired in 1962.         Dr. Healea published research papers on the interaction of beams of electrons with metal surfaces. During World War II, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she helped develop the magnetron into a power source for an aerial navigation system. Later, she worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory as it was being readied for work on nuclear physics.         After reaching emeritus status at Vassar, she spent several years at Harvard with a group studying the atomic physics of the upper atmosphere.         In retirement she became an artist who exhibited her abstract canvases in Dutchess County and in New York City.  In her 80's, she worked with acrylic paints to explore the interplay of color and design. She was a member of the Dutchess County Art Association and the Mill Street Loft, an arts-education center in Poughkeepsie.         Dr. Healea is survived by a sister, Edith Everett, and a niece, Mildred Barnett, both of Fresno, Calif.       
         Anne M. Johnson, a former vice president of Beginner Books, a children's book division of Random House, died on Sunday at her home in Clifton, N.J. She was 62.         She had a brief illness, said Robert L. Bernstein, with whom she had worked at Random House.         Mrs. Johnson, a native of Staten Island, graduated from Hunter College and briefly worked for Doubleday & Company before joining Random House in 1956 as a secretary. The following year she began to work with Mr. Bernstein. From 1966 she was the assistant to the chairman and president while Mr. Bernstein held those positions at Random House.         At Beginner Books, she worked closely with Theodor S. Geisel, the star author for that imprint known as Dr. Seuss. She was a board member of the Dr. Seuss Foundation.         Mrs. Johnson was the widow of Hugh Johnson, executive vice president of Hammond Publishing, who died in 1987.       
         Elizabeth Steinway Chapin, a member of the New York State Council on the Arts and a volunteer for many other cultural organizations, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was bone cancer, said her husband, Schuyler G. Chapin, who is dean emeritus of Columbia University's School of the Arts and a former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mrs. Chapin was a scion of the piano-making Steinway family. She had been on the Arts Council, which administers grants to arts organizations, since 1978. At her death, she was also the senior trustee of the Harlem School of the Arts.         She retired recently as chairman of the Alliance of Resident Theaters-New York, and from the boards of the Professional Children's School and the New York Revels. In addition, she had been a trustee of the Dalton School, where she was also employed for many years, in a variety of positions. Libraries' Benefactor         In 1971, Mrs. Chapin created a group that became the Volunteers of the New York Public Library. She also served as co-chairwoman of the Committee for the Library of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.         In 1975 she became a founding member of the Citizens Committee for New York City, which was formed to help the city during its fiscal crisis.         Mrs. Chapin was born in Plymouth, Mass., grew up in Manhattan, attended Dalton and Concord Academy in Concord, Mass., and graduated in 1945 from Radcliffe College. In addition to her husband of 46 years, she is survived by four sons, Henry B. of Manhattan; Theodore S. of Manhattan; Samuel G. of Hingham, Mass., and Miles W. of Manhattan; eight grandchildren; two brothers, Henry Z. Steinway of Manhattan and Frederick Steinway of Amherst, Mass., and a sister, Lydia G. Cochrane of Chicago.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         R. Louise McManus, a leader in nursing education who spent 36 years on the faculty of Teachers College of Columbia University, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Natick, Mass. She was 97 and had lived in Manhattan before retiring to Massachusetts.         Her death came after a brief illness, the college reported.         On the faculty since 1925, Professor McManus served as director of the Division of Nursing Education at Teachers College from 1947 until her retirement in 1961. At the college she founded the Institute of Research and Service in Nursing Education.         Professor McManus was a native of North Smithfield, R.I.         She was a past chairman of the nursing council of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation. Teachers College named its Nursing Education Alumni Medal after her in 1964.         Professor McManus is survived by four daughters, Joan Lawrence of Natick, Madeline Frankenhauser of Falmouth, Mass., Catherine Myers of Wilmington, Del., and Anna McThaden of Seattle; 23 grandchildren, 37 great-grandchildren, and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Halina Rodzinski, who worked for Polish charities and wrote "Our Two Lives," a memoir about her husband, the conductor Artur Rodzinski, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was chronic leukemia, said her son, Richard.         Mrs. Rodzinski was born in Warsaw. In 1934, she married Rodzinski and went with him to Cleveland, where he was music director of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Mrs. Rodzinski was active in several Polish charitable and cultural organizations, including Polish Mutual Assistance, founded in 1956 to help Poles in the United States who had been left destitute by World War II. From 1959 until her death she was president of the Committee for the Blind of Poland.         She was also a founding member and honorary chairman of the Harlem School of the Arts and for many years was on the advisory board of Young Concert Artists.         Mrs. Rodzinski's 1976 memoir, "Our Two Lives," received critical praise for its vivid portrayal of her husband as an autocratic, temperamental genius who conducted with a baton in his right hand and a loaded revolver in his hip pocket. Mr. Rodzinski, who died in 1958, was music director of the New York Philharmonic from 1943 to 1948.         In May, Mrs. Rodzinski was awarded Poland's highest civilian honor, the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit.         In addition to her son, who is the executive director of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, she is survived by a sister, Aniela Mieczyslawska of London, and a grandchild.       
         Frances Ruth Grant, who spent her life opposing dictatorships and promoting human rights in the Americas, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Miss Grant's dedication to Latin American culture, art and human rights began in her childhood. The daughter of a pioneer of New Mexico's statehood, she was born and raised in the remote pueblo of Abiquiu in the foothills of the Valle Grande mountains. It was there that she absorbed the atmosphere of Hispanic-American culture.         She was educated at Barnard College and graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1918. She also received extensive tutoring in economics, political science, music and the arts. A Museum Founder         She was a founder in 1923 of the Nicholas Roerich Museum in Manhattan, under whose auspices she went to the Far East and wrote about the philosophies and cultures of India and Tibet. She served as a vice president of the museum until 1937.         Miss Grant first visited Latin America in 1929 and after that devoted most of her energy to the republics of the hemisphere. She lectured at virtually all of its universities and centers of learning and started some of the first cultural interchanges, including exhibitions, musical programs and public forums.         Her work was primarily responsible for the Roerich Pact, an inter-American agreement for the preservation of cultural sites signed at the White House by 21 republics in 1935. She founded the Pan American Women's Association in 1930 and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom in 1950 and headed both of them into her late 80's. A Journal Editor         From 1951 until the mid-1980's, she edited the English and Spanish editions of Hemispherica, a journal published by the Inter-American Association. For this she received a special citation in 1982 at Columbia University from the trustees of the annual Maria Moors Cabot prizes in inter-American journalism.         Recognized as a leader in the defense of civil and politcal liberties, she was a past chairman of the Latin American section and secretary of the International League for Human Rights. The league is a nongovernmental agency accredited by the United Nations whose predecessors date back to the Dreyfus affair in France nearly a century ago.         Jose Figueres Ferrer, then the President of Costa Rica and himself a resolute champion of democracy, paid tribute to Miss Grant in a public address in New York in 1951. He called her "the greatest fighter for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere."       
         Dr. Kathrine Koller, a Renaissance scholar who became the first woman to head a department at the University of Rochester, died on Aug. 17 at a Rochester nursing home. Dr. Koller, a resident of Rochester, was 91.         She had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Koller, a gifted speaker who joined the Rochester faculty in 1942, was chairman of the English department from 1946 to 1958. Beyond her expertise in 17th-century English literature, she was known for her belief in the need of a firm footing in the humanities for young people to help them learn self-discipline and integrity.         She was born in Hudson, N.Y., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wittenberg University and received a doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 1932. She taught high school English in Ohio and was an assistant professor at Bryn Mawr College before she went to Rochester.         There, she was named Joseph H. Gilmore Professor of English in 1948. Under her guidance, the English department nearly doubled its faculty to 20 members and instituted a Ph.D. program for future English teachers.         Her articles on Renaissance literature appeared in scholarly journals. She reached emeritus status in 1967.         In 1950, Dr. Koller married William Diez, professor of political science at Rochester. He died three years ago.       
         Dr. Barbara Biber Bodansky, a leading researcher in child psychology and early education for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 89.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Dr. Biber -- the name she used professionally -- was chairman of the child development faculty of the Bank Street College of Education from 1931 to 1960. She directed its research division from 1950 to 1963.         In those positions, she played a central role in creating several new graduate and research programs dealing with early education theory, child psychology and social policy.         In 1973 she became a Distinguished Research Scholar Emeritus at the college, which is on 112th Street near Broadway and was founded in 1916 as a center for training and research in early childhood education. Strong Self-Images         As a teacher, Dr. Biber believed that the best early education programs develop the emotional life of children as well as their intellects, foster strong self-images, encourage responsibility to others, and support imagination and curiosity.         Toward that end, Dr. Biber, along with her colleagues at the college, helped to establish teacher workshops in New York City public schools in the 1940's and 50's.         In the 1960's she directed a study of schools and mental health with a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health. At the end of that decade, she began devising the basic principles for federally financed day care and Head Start programs.         At the age of 80, she completed "Early Education and Psychological Development" (Yale University Press, 1984). She also was co-author of two books reporting major research studies: "Child Life in School" (1942) and "The Pyschological Impact of School Experience" (1969).         Dr. Biber, who was born in Brooklyn, first attended Barnard College and then graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1942 from Columbia University.         In 1929, Dr. Biber was married to Dr. Oscar Bodansky, chief of clinical biochemistry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He died in 1977.         She is survived by a daughter, Margery B. Franklin of Manhattan; two grandsons, Kenneth and David Frankin, and a sister, Lilian Uviller Pilat.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Nadia Stark, a founder and president of the Stark Carpet Corporation in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Stark, who was a fashion model in the 1930's, designed women's hats for several years before helping her husband, Arthur Stark, found Stark Carpets in 1935. The company caters primarily to decorators and their clientele, and has provided carpet designs for the White House, the Smithsonian Institution and Gracie Mansion.         Mrs. Stark was active in the operation of the company until her illness forced her to retire early this year. Her sons, Steven and John, now run the company, which also imports rugs and manufactures other types of floor coverings.         After Mr. Stark died in 1968, Mrs. Stark married Dr. David Anderman, an eye surgeon. He died in 1978. Mrs. Stark then married Theodore Silbert, chairman of the board of Sterling National Bank, who died last year.         Mrs. Stark is survived by her sons, both of Manhattan; a sister, Bea Zolt of Manhattan; two brothers, Mitchell and Bernard Snitkim, both of Miami, and five grandchildren.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Elizabeth L. R. Coates, a Connecticut lawyer active in community affairs, died on Thursday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 44 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.         The cause was a viral infection following a bone marrow transplant, said her husband, Charles E. Coates 3d.         Mrs. Coates was born in Salem, Mass., was an honors graduate of Wellesley College and received her law degree from Boston University. She worked for the General Electric Company as a lawyer for seven years before going into private practice in Greenwich, most recently with the firm of Hopper & Krause.         She was a past president and board chairman of the New Canaan Community Nursery School, president of the Southern Connecticut Wellesley Club and an elder of the First Presbyterian Church of New Canaan. She also was a supporter of South School in New Canaan, where she was an officer of the Parent-Teacher Council.         Besides her husband, also a lawyer in Greenwich, Mrs. Coates's survivors are her three daughters, Susanna, Margaret and Catherine; her parents, Donald T. and Betty Richardson of Fairfield, Conn.; and her three sisters, Susan R. Duncan of Simsbury, Conn., Leslie B. Richardson of Yardley, Pa., and Lisa Richardson-Bach of Marblehead, Mass.       
         Alice Tully, a philanthropist who was an important figure in New York City's musical life for almost half a century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her lawyer, James McGarry, said the cause was the flu. She had not been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 1991.         Miss Tully, for whom Lincoln Center's chamber-music hall is named, was as respected for her knowledge of music and its practitioners as for her generosity.         As a singer who had a modest operatic and recital career in the 1930's, she was keenly aware of the problems performers face, and throughout her life was a friend and supporter of singers, pianists and composers. After she inherited her family's wealth -- her maternal grandfather was Amory Houghton, the founder of Corning Glass Works -- she donated many millions of dollars to the arts. A Birthday Portrait         For many years Miss Tully made her contributions anonymously, and when she agreed to underwrite a chamber-music hall in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center, she stipulated that her name not be associated with it. Eventually, John D. Rockefeller 3d, Lincoln Center's first chairman, persuaded her to allow the hall to be named in her honor. In 1987, to celebrate her 85th birthday, Lincoln Center commissioned Thomas Buechner to paint a full-length portrait of her, which hangs in the hall's main foyer. Miss Tully always refused to tell how much of the hall's cost she contributed, but she did not dispute reports that said she paid most of the $4.5 million.         She did say that one reason she was hesitant to accept the hall's dedication at first was that Philharmonic Hall and the New York State Theater had been acoustical disasters. "I did not want my name associated with a hall that would have bad acoustics," she told an interviewer in 1987. She changed her mind when Lincoln Center engaged Heinrich Keilholz, who had revamped Severance Hall in Cleveland in 1958, as acoustician.  More Space, Fewer Seats         She took an active hand in the hall's design, selecting the colors of the walls, seat covering and foyer carpeting. She paid particular attention to adequate leg room.         "I had spent so many, many hours cramped in narrow spaces, both here and in Europe, and I felt that this was something we should have," she said in the 1987 interview. "The architects disagreed, because what I wanted would have meant having three fewer rows. So I went to William Schuman, who was president of Lincoln Center at the time, and I said: 'You're a tall man. Wouldn't you like to sit comfortably? Do let us have one comfortable hall in New York City.' "         Mr. Schuman agreed, Miss Tully said. "So I drew a breath of relief. But I had to keep my eye on it just the same."         Later, after much personal research in Europe, she was deeply involved in selecting the Theodore Kuhn Company to build the hall's organ, which experts said cost well over $250,000.         When the hall was in the planning stages, Miss Tully encouraged the creation of its resident ensemble, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and was the chairwoman of its board for many years. She also served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School of Music. Myriad Beneficiaries         In addition to her involvement with Lincoln Center, Miss Tully was an active supporter of dance, art and humanitarian organizations. She gave generously to the Martha Graham Dance Company and Eliot Feld's ballet troupe, and she was a board member of numerous other arts and educational institutions. She contributed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Morgan Library, among others.         Michael J. Spencer, a pianist who founded Hospital Audiences, which provides access to the arts for the disabled, said yesterday that when he began playing concerts in state mental hospitals in the 1960's he sought funds everywhere and only one organization responded. "It was something called the Maya Corporation, and it was only in the early 70's that I found out it was Alice Tully providing the funds." Miss Tully had founded the corporation to disperse cash gifts anonymously. Mr. Spencer added that he received a Maya donation only last week.         Miss Tully never wanted the extent of her largesse known. Irwin Scherzer, the manager of the Chamber Music Society in its early days and a close friend of Miss Tully, said: "She wouldn't know herself how much money she had donated. She did what she thought was best, where she thought it would do the most good."         Alice Bigelow Tully was born on Sept. 11, 1902, in Corning, N.Y. Her father, William J. Tully, was a lawyer and a two-term New York State senator. The actress Katharine Hepburn is her second cousin. When Mr. Tully became general counsel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1908, the family moved to New York City, where Miss Tully attended Mrs. J. D. Randall MacIvor's School. Later she continued her studies at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.  A Recital Inspired Her         Miss Tully often said that she decided to devote herself to music when she was 14 or 15 years old, after hearing a recital by the pianist Josef Hofmann. But although piano studies were part of her schooling, her first musical love was singing. In 1922, after studying voice in New York for three years, she went to Paris for seven years of study with Jean Perier, the baritone who created the role of Pelleas in Debussy's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," and with Miguel Fontecha and Therese Leschetizky.         Beginning as a mezzo-soprano and then moving to the dramatic soprano repertory, Miss Tully made her professional debut in 1927, when she sang works by Gluck, Franck, Chausson and Faure with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris. Six years later she made her operatic debut at the Hippodrome in New York, singing Santuzza -- her best role, by her own estimation -- in a Salmaggi Opera production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana."         She also sang the title role in a production of Bizet's "Carmen" at the Manhattan Opera House in 1935, and through the late 1930's she performed frequently as a recitalist in Europe and the United States. Reviewing a 1937 Town Hall recital in The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote that Miss Tully's program was of "rare interest and artistic distinction" and praised her "musicianly zeal and catholicity of taste."         Miss Tully, looking back on her career in a 1982 interview with Harold C. Schonberg of The Times, said: "It may not have been the biggest career, but it was a good one. I was always concerned with the best in music, and I think I had something individual to offer."  Avid Amateur Pilot         With the outbreak of World War II, Miss Tully settled permanently in New York and continued her vocal studies. But she suspended her career to devote herself to the war effort. An avid amateur pilot, she joined the Civil Air Patrol and flew on submarine scouting missions. But she decided to "be of more use" and became a Red Cross nurse's aid at the French Hospital in Manhattan.         In 1950, Miss Tully stopped singing professionally because, she later said, she felt that her voice was losing its flexibility. Upon the death of her mother, Clara Houghton Tully, in 1958, Miss Tully inherited a substantial estate, and began her career as a philanthropist. It was at about that time that her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln Center, approached her with the idea of contributing toward the concert hall that now bears her name.         The hall opened on Miss Tully's 67th birthday, Sept. 11, 1969, with a program by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. It was judged a superb setting for chamber music, both acoustically and visually, and the most successful of Lincoln Center's concert halls.         Miss Tully, who never married, was a tall, slender, regal woman with a friendly smile, a wry sense of humor, and a comprehensive knowledge of musical literature and the world of performers. After chamber music and art songs, her love was opera, particularly Wagner, and well into her 80's she regularly traveled to Europe to see new productions, keep track of singers and directors, and serve on competition juries. She was especially fond of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; its founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, wrote "Cantilene e Scherzo" and "Nocturne" for her. Others who dedicated works to her include Mr. Schuman, who wrote "A Round for Alice," and Riccardo Malipiero, who composed "Serenata per Alice Tully." Recipient of Many Honors         In 1970, Miss Tully was awarded a Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award. She received the Gallatin Medal from New York University in 1976 for "contributions of lasting significance to society," was a recipient of the first National Medal of Arts in 1985, and received the American Red Cross Humanitarian Award in 1988. A devoted Francophile for most of her life, she received many honors from the French Government, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.         Miss Tully's only sibling, a younger sister, Marion Tully Dimick of Washington, died in 1981.
