         Dorothy Maynor, a highly regarded soprano recitalist who founded the Harlem School of the Arts, died on Monday at the Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. She was 85 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.         Miss Maynor, whose career helped open the way for black artists like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, possessed a voice that the New Grove Dictionary of  American Music describes as "a soaring, belllike soprano capable of exquisite musical effects, supported by a sincere and ardent temperament." She took New York by storm in a sold-out recital at Town Hall in 1939 and pursued a successful recital career.         Although she committed more than 100 operatic roles to memory, she never appeared on an opera stage; there were no such opportunities for a black artist  in the late 1930's and the 1940's, when she was in her prime. (Miss Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, did not make her debut there until 1955.)         Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk, Va., and as a child she sang in the choir of her father's church. She entered Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va., intending to become a teacher of home economics, but she also joined the renowned Hampton Choir, with which she toured Europe in 1929. On the  advice of the choir director, R. Nathaniel Dett, she changed her major to music  and earned a bachelor's degree in 1933.         After being awarded a scholarship, she studied choir direction at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., where she received a second bachelor's degree in music and choral conducting in 1935. While on tour in New England with the school's choir, she was encouraged by several wealthy benefactors to pursue a concert career. Three years of private study in New York followed, with Wilfried Klamroth and John Alan Haughton. At this time she changed the spelling of her name from Mainor.         After hearing her sing at the 1939 Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood in western Massachusetts, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky reportedly jumped up  and down, shouting: "It is a miracle! It is a musical revelation! The world must hear her!" Koussevitzky, who called Miss Maynor "a native Flagstad," immediately used her in recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.         She made her formal debut at Town Hall in Manhattan later that year, on Nov.  19, in a widely anticipated event that was sold out more than a week in advance. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, hailed her as "one of the most remarkable soprano voices of the rising generation," called her voice "phenomenal for its range, character and varied expressive resources."         Miss Maynor began touring extensively in the United States, often appearing as a soloist with leading orchestras. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1940 with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by John Barbirolli. In the late 40's she toured Latin America and Europe. She often performed at benefits to aid the  war effort and black causes.         She sang at the Presidential Inaugural galas for Harry S. Truman in 1949 and  Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In 1952, by special permission of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she appeared as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra at Constitution Hall in the first commercial appearance there by a black artist since Miss Anderson had been barred from performing at the hall in  1939. (Miss Anderson subsequently gave benefit performances at the hall.)         Miss Maynor recorded popular arias and songs for RCA Victor. Although she never appeared on the opera stage, she recorded the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" under Arturo Toscanini.         In 1963, she retired to work with her husband, the Rev. Shelby Rooks, at St.  James Presbyterian Church at West 141st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, where he was pastor. That year she founded the Harlem School of the Arts. The school offered classes in music, ballet, modern dance, drama and art to poor children for minimal fees, sometimes as little as 50 cents a lesson, and lent or rented instruments to students who did not own one.         "In most schools, if you don't have a piano, you can't take lessons," Miss Maynor told one interviewer. "But we say, 'Good, you come here and practice.' "  She served as executive director of the school until 1979 and also taught there. In 1977 she raised more than $2 million to build a new facility for the school,  which originally served 20 children and now has more than 1,000 students.         "What I dream of is changing the image held by the children," she said on another occasion. "We've made them believe everything beautiful is outside the community. We would like them to make beauty in our community."         Her work with the school is recounted in "Dorothy Maynor and the Harlem School of the Arts: The Diva and the Dream" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1993), by William F. Rogers Jr.         She received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, Carnegie-Mellon University and Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C..         In 1975, she became the first black member of the Metropolitan Opera board.         She is survived by her husband.         Correction:  March 2, 1996, Saturday         An obituary last Saturday about the soprano Dorothy Maynor credited her with  one recording incorrectly. She did not record the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" with Toscanini.       
         Sharman Douglas, a socialite whose life was defined by her friendship as a youth with Princess Margaret and her ensuing lifelong friendship with Britain's  royal family, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         John S. Zinsser Jr., a cousin, said she died of bone cancer.         Miss Douglas first burst into the news as a teen-ager when her father, Lewis W. Douglas, was appointed Ambassador to the Court of St. James in 1947. She quickly became a close friend of Princess Margaret, and her parties in the official residence attracted the cream of young London glitterati. At a party in 1949, at which she was the host, the present Queen, who was then Princess Elizabeth, arrived dressed as an Edwardian parlor maid, Prince Philip as a waiter and Princess Margaret as a can-can girl, replete with lace panties and black stockings.         Miss Douglas attended the Brearley School and left Vassar to accompany her parents to England. When the family returned to the United States in 1950, she made her home in New York. She did a stint at booking talent for the "Tonight" show and briefly worked in the publicity field for movie studios. In 1966, after the election of John V. Lindsay as Mayor, she joined the city's Public Events Department. She later formed Sass, a public relations company that specialized in charitable benefits and in British accounts.         "She loved people and she was fun," said Mary Lindsay, the wife of Mr. Lindsay and a longtime friend.         Throughout her life she was a social figure on both coasts and in England. She was a guest at the 1991 banquet in Washington given by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh in honor of President and Mrs. Bush, and entertained Princess Margaret and Prince Philip during their visits. She was particularly visible at social events that related to England, such as a celebratory party for Queen Elizabeth's birthday, where she joined other social figures like Steven and Kimberly Rockefeller and Jean MacArthur.         Miss Douglas's father, who before his appointment as Ambassador was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona and budget director for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was the son of James Stuart Douglas, the owner of copper  mines in Arizona. Her mother, Peggy Zinsser Douglas, was a descendant of the family that founded the Zinsser Chemical Company.         Miss Douglas was married in 1968 to Andrew Hay, an importer. They divorced in 1977. She is survived by her brothers, Lewis W. Douglas Jr., of Denver, and James Stuart Douglas of Tucson.       
         Mary Lavin, whose short stories and novels about the conflicts in the hearts  of her fellow Irish men and women transcended mere tales of life in Ireland, died on Monday at a nursing home here. She was 83.         Ms. Lavin was the author of 19 collections of short stories and three novels. She won three Guggenheim Fellowships and a number of literary awards, including  the Katherine Mansfield Prize, in 1961. Her stories appeared regularly in The New Yorker.         Her death was front-page news in The Irish Times, whose chief book critic, Eileen Battersby, called her "one of modern Irish fiction's most subversive voices" and said, "Her art explored often brutal tensions, disappointments and frustrations dictating the relationships within so-called 'normal' families."         Ms. Lavin's favorite form was the short story, which she once likened to "a flash of lightning lighting up the whole landscape all at once." In a 1976 interview she was quoted as saying: "Publishers are definitely unfair to short-story writers. Since the essence of the short story is its conciseness, an addiction to change is an occupational disease and not the self-indulgence publishers think." She also said: "I don't think a story has to have a beginning, middle and end. I think of it more as an arrow in flight."         Critics often compared Ms. Lavin's work to that of other acclaimed Irish writers, including Liam O'Flaherty and Sean O'Faolain, and also perceived echoes of Balzac, Chekhov and Saki. Her writing influenced the work of others, as well, including the novelist William Trevor.         Ms. Lavin said her childhood reading of Jane Austen influenced her writing. She said that, as a realist, her writing was "only looking closer than normal into the human heart, whose vagaries and contrarieties have their own integral design." In an appreciation in The Irish Times, Maurice Harmon, professor emeritus of Anglo-Irish Literature at University College in Dublin, wrote: "She  drew upon her own experience. Her stories explore and reflect the patterns of her life: the return of the little girl from America to the strange, puritanical society of her mother's people" in Western Ireland.         "At the high point of her career," he continued, "she wrote about widows who  refuse to be passive in the face of death, who keep their memories of love and go forth to encounter experience with openness and with the wisdom of years."         Mary Lavin was born on June 11, 1912, of immigrant parents in East Walpole, Mass. When she was 10 the family moved back to Athenry, in Western Ireland. She  wrote her first short story in 1938. Her first collection, "Tales From Bective Bridge," won the James Tate Black Memorial Prize in 1942 and helped establish her career.         Her short-story collections include "The Long Ago" (1944), "The Becker Wives" (1946), "A Single Lady" (1957), "In the Middle of the Fields" (1966) and "The Shrine and Other Stories" (1976). She published her first novel, "The House in Clewe Street," in 1945; her second, "Mary O'Grady," appeared in 1950.         She served as president of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1971.         Ms. Lavin's first marriage was to William Walsh, a lawyer, who died in 1954.  They had three daughters, who survive. In 1969 she married Michael McDonald Scott, a former Roman Catholic priest, who died in 1990. In recent years her health failed and she lived in a nursing home.         Her stories were characterized by arresting opening and closing lines. One story, "Happiness," begins with "Mother had a lot to say" and ends: "Mother made the last effort of her life and grasped at Bea's meaning. She let out a sigh, and, closing her eyes, she sank back, and this time her head sank so deep into the pillow that it would have been dented had it been a pillow of stone." Another, "A Memory," begins, "James did all right for a man on his own," and ends, "Under a weight of bitterness too great to be borne, his face was pressed  into the wet leaves and, when he gulped for breath, the rotted leaves were sucked into his mouth."       
         M. Shanara Gilbert, an associate professor of law at the City University of New York Law School at Queens College, was killed on Tuesday in a highway accident in South Africa. She was 45 and lived in Brooklyn.         The accident, in which the school's former dean, W. Haywood Burns, also died, occurred when a truck ran a red light near Cape Town and struck the car in which they were riding, university officials said. They were attending a conference on democracy and international law.         Ms. Gilbert, a graduate of Syracuse University in political journalism, was  a founder and co-director of the City University Law School's Defender Clinic, a member of the board of directors of the National Conference of Black Lawyers and past chairwoman of the conference's Section on Criminal Justice. After receiving a J.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in 1980, she worked as a staff lawyer with the District of Columbia Public Defender Service and the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services.         Ms. Gilbert, who was born in Gap, Pa., worked for legal aid agencies well before becoming a lawyer, and was on the advisory board of the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem. In 1993, as a consultant to the Ford Foundation, she wrote a report on the status of university legal aid clinics in South Africa.         She is survived by her companion, Wayne Walcott, and two aunts, Alberta Davis of Newark and Mildred White of Philadelphia.       
         P. L. Travers, who insisted she had never meant to write for children when the magical nanny Mary Poppins leaped from her pen, died on Tuesday at her home  in London. She was 96.         Miss Travers, a native of Australia who had lived in England since she was a  young woman, had been at various times in her life a poet, journalist, essayist, film and theater critic, dancer, Shakespearean actress and scholar of folklore and myth.         But she became renowned for "Mary Poppins," which, if not consciously intended for children, has been devoured by generations of them since its publication in 1934. The book, which has sold millions of copies and has been translated into more than 20 languages, has inspired critical studies, a string  of sequels and the 1964 Walt Disney movie musical, starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.         "I think the idea of Mary Poppins has been blowing in and out of me, like a curtain at a window, all my life," Miss Travers said in 1964. The critic Richard Lingeman wrote that Miss Travers "has succeeded in creating a timeless world inhabited by real people and complete unto itself -- an immortal world that is summoned into being, unchanged whenever one opens a book."         A prolific writer who was still publishing well into her 80's, Miss Travers employed a precise, lyrical prose. Her entire body of work, whether for children or adults, is linked by a deep concern with myth and mysticism, a belief in the interconnectedness of human experience, and a ceaseless quest for meaning.         "Her great thing was E. M. Forster's wonderful phrase 'Only connect,' " Jenny Koralek, a children's writer and longtime friend, said by telephone from London  yesterday. "That is the key to her entirely: a wonderful ranging mind and heart, putting together the pieces of life."         A gracious observer of the English proprieties who at the same time did not suffer fools gladly, Miss Travers had deep blue eyes, high cheekbones and, as a  young woman, a cap of curly dark gold hair. Her likeness appears once, hidden in Mary Shepard's illustrations, in each of the many Mary Poppins books.         Miss Travers, who demonstrated the gravest consideration for children but often displayed a tart impatience with her adult interrogators, was taciturn to  the point of secrecy about the details of her personal life. Partly to render herself anonymous, she signed her work only with her initials instead of the name -- Pamela Lyndon Travers -- that she adopted when she went on the stage as  a young woman.         As a result of her fierce privacy, concrete information about Miss Travers's  life is often elusive. She frequently supplied interviewers with different renditions of events large and small, as if these variant accounts had arisen from the oral tradition that so often inspired her writing.         It is known that she was born Helen Lyndon Goff in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, on Aug. 9, 1899, the eldest of three daughters of Robert and Margaret Goff. Her father was a sugar planter, and Miss Travers recalled growing up near  the Great Barrier Reef in a tropical world of sugar cane, shells and mangoes. Miss Travers's Irish father and her mother, an Australian of Scottish and Irish  descent, infused the household with the mystery and melancholy of the literary traditions of the British Isles.         "Many a phrase, as ordinary to me then as the daily porridge, began its life, as I later learned, as a quotation from a poem or snatch from a ballad," she once said.         A voracious reader, Miss Travers began writing stories as a young child. Her  principal influences, she later said, were fairy tales and the Bible. A formative event in Miss Travers's childhood was the death of her father when she was 7. She moved with her mother and sisters to New South Wales to live with a great-aunt, who years later would become the title character in Miss Travers's 1941 book, "Aunt Sass."         Throughout her writing life, Miss Travers retained the extraordinary ability  to tap into the private, wistful anguish of childhood, and often said that she viewed the passage from childhood to adulthood as a single unbroken thread. "The ideas I had then move about in me now," she once said, adding elsewhere that "sorrow lies like a heartbeat behind everything I have written."         Miss Travers began her acting career at 10, when she was cast in a professional production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." As a teen-ager, she toured Australia with a Shakespearean company. She also worked as a dancer and journalist, and began publishing poetry. Sometime during this period she adopted the professional name Pamela Travers.         In 1924 Miss Travers left Australia for England, arriving with five pounds in her pocket. She soon began contributing poems to The Irish Statesman, a literary weekly whose editor, George William Russell, was the poet A. E. Through A. E., who became a mentor and lifelong friend, and through W. B. Yeats, to whom he introduced her, Miss Travers began to pursue the deep interest in Celtic folklore and Eastern mysticism that is palpable in all her subsequent work. Miss Travers also contributed film and theater criticism to the weekly The New English.         In 1934 Mary Poppins blew into Miss Travers's life and remained long enough to be captured on paper. Miss Travers was living in Sussex, recuperating from an illness in a 900-year-old thatched cottage mentioned in the Domesday Book. One day she found herself with two bored visiting children to entertain. She came up with a story about a raven-haired, rosy-cheeked governess who arrives with her carpetbag and parrot-headed umbrella at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to care for Jane and Michael Banks and their siblings. When Mary Poppins wasn't busy ruling the nursery with a will of iron, or admiring her own reflection in a shop window, she worked fabulous deeds: sliding up banisters, presiding at tea parties held on the ceiling, pasting gold paper stars in the heavens at night.         Encouraged by friends, Miss Travers published "Mary Poppins," which was an immediate critical success. A sequel, "Mary Poppins Comes Back," appeared the following year. It was followed by "Mary Poppins Opens the Door" (1943), "Mary Poppins in the Park" (1952), "Mary Poppins From A to Z" (1962), "Mary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane" (1982) and "Mary Poppins and the House Next Door (1988).         "Nothing I had written before 'Mary Poppins' had anything to do with children, and I have always assumed, when I thought about it at all, that she had come out of the same wall of nothingness as the poetry, myth and legend that had absorbed me all my writing life," she wrote in 1978.         Although the Mary Poppins books were set permanently in the London of the 1930's, the Disney film was transposed to Edwardian times at Miss Travers's suggestion to give it a period sensibility. But despite her collaboration, Miss  Travers expressed dissatisfaction with the finished product.         "I think I was disturbed at seeing it so externalized, so oversimplified, so  generalized," she said in a 1967 interview. "I think that 'Mary Poppins' needs a subtle reader, in many respects, to grasp all its implications, and I understand that these cannot be translated in terms of the film."         After the outbreak of World War II, Miss Travers spent the years from 1940 to 1945 in the United States. Her experience became the basis for her 1941 book "I  Go by Sea, I Go by Land," the fictional diary of an 11-year-old girl who, like Miss Travers, was evacuated from England. The author would later return to the United States as a writer in residence at Radcliffe College in 1965 and at Smith College the following year.         In the decades after the war, Miss Travers continued to write. From 1976 on she was a consulting editor of the New York-based journal Parabola, which is devoted to the scholarly exploration of myth and tradition. Ms. Travers's books  during these years include "Friend Monkey," a 1971 retelling of the Hindu myth of the monkey lord Hanuman, a 1973 biography of the Russian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff, "About the Sleeping Beauty" (1975), a critical exploration of the fairy tale, and "What the Bee Knows" (1989), a collection of her Parabola pieces.         Miss Travers became the subject of public controversy in the early 1980's after "Mary Poppins" was banned from the San Francisco Public Library because of concerns over its treatment of members of minority groups. Of particular concern was the chapter entitled "Bad Tuesday," in which Mary Poppins and her charges travel to exotic corners of the world, meeting, among other characters, a black  woman on a South Sea island who holds a "pickaninny" on her lap, speaks in an American Southern dialect and offers everyone watermelon.         She rewrote the chapter for the 1981 revised edition of the book, substituting exotic animals for the offending ethnic characters. But in her public comments about making the revisions, she adopted a somewhat defensive tone. "I have done so not as an apology for anything I have written," she said.  "The reason is much more simple: I do not wish to see Mary Poppins tucked away in a closet."         In recent years, as her health began to decline, Miss Travers was confined increasingly to her home, a white Georgian town house with a bright pink front door in London's Chelsea section. Although she had previously stated that she looked forward to her old age, when she could sit in her rocking chair knowing all the answers, she grew incensed when a reporter for The New York Times asked  her about it in a 1994 interview. "But here I am sitting in my chair, and I don't think I'm going to know all the answers," she shouted. "I'm human."         Miss Travers, who never married, is survived by an adopted son, Camillus Travers of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Martha Keehn, a social worker in India and Africa, died on April 5 at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 73 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         From 1952 to 1961, Mrs. Keehn directed social welfare projects for the Indian Cooperative Union, helping organize handicraft and other small industries in the villages of India.         A graduate of Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, Mrs. Keehn received  a master's degree from Columbia University in 1946.         She is survived by her husband of 50 years and co-worker, Thomas Keehn; a daughter, Deborah Keehn Black of Manhattan; five sons, Jonathan, of Grass Valley, Calif., David, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Benjamin, of Holliston, Mass., Adam, of Queens and Burkina Faso, and Joel, of Peekskill, N.Y.; a brother, William McKee, of Lafayette, Calif.; two sisters, Beatrice Watson, of Barstow, Calif., and Margaret Seder, of Stonington, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Camilla de Leon, a dance composer and accompanist in the 1930's and 40's, died on April 3 at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn. She was 80, and lived in Middletown.         Ms. de Leon accompanied classes at the Martha Graham studio and composed for  choreographers including Pearl Primus, with whom she worked into the 1970's, and Katherine Dunham, Pearl Lang and Jean Erdman. As the only white member of the Primus troupe, Ms. de Leon frequently had to get meals and restroom keys surreptitiously for Primus's black dancers when the company toured in the South.         Ms. de Leon also worked in the musical theater. She was rehearsal pianist for the original production of "South Pacific" and musical director for "You're  a Good Man, Charlie Brown." She taught voice and piano at Wesleyan University from 1972 to her death.         She is survived by two daughters, Inara de Leon of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Winona de Leon of Monterey, Calif.; three sons, Noel, of Odense, Denmark; Michael, of Garberville, Calif., and Emile, of Middletown, and two sisters, Maude Merrill of Manhattan and Irene Novak of Westport, Conn.       
         Tamara Toumanova, a child-prodigy ballerina of the 1930's who became familiar to American audiences as one of the most glamorous stars of 20th-century dance,  died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died after a brief illness, said John Taras, a friend.         By the time she was 13, Miss Toumanova was internationally acclaimed as one  of the three so-called baby ballerinas of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. She and two other phenomenally gifted daughters of Russian emigres -- Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska -- were discovered in Parisian ballet studios by George Balanchine. They soon became the talk of London and New York.         Adoring fans nicknamed Miss Toumanova "the black pearl of the Russian ballet." Even as a teen-ager, her beauty was as remarkable as her technique. Kathrine Sorley Walker, a British dance historian, said of her in "De Basil's Ballets Russes" (1983) that with her "large dark eyes, raven wings of hair and magnolia skin, she combined lyricism and virtuosity to a remarkable degree."         A founding member of the de Basil Ballets Russes in 1932, Miss Toumanova inspired two of this century's greatest choreographers. She created roles in Balanchine's "Cotillon" and "Concurrence" and in Leonide Massine's "Jeux d'Enfants" with the company. She left the following year and was given starring  roles by Balanchine in his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933. Returning to the Ballets Russes a few months afterward, she danced in the classics as well as in  such new works by Massine as "Choreartium" and "Symphonie Fantastique." Later in her career, she performed with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and appeared in a number of Hollywood films.         Miss Toumanova was born on March 2, 1919, in a boxcar in Siberia. She was the daughter of a czarist army colonel and his wife, who were fleeing the Bolsheviks. The couple settled in Paris, where their daughter became a pupil of  Olga Preobrajenska, a Russian-born teacher.         Miss Toumanova astonished balletgoers in 1929, at the age of 9, when she appeared at the Paris Opera in "L'Eventail de Jeanne," a ballet with a cast of children. Reviewing the production in the theatrical magazine Comoedia, Andre Levinson, the most famous Parisian ballet critic of the time, called Miss Toumanova's dancing both "astonishing" and "frightening."         When quarrels between de Basil and Massine prompted the choreographer to form his own company, Miss Toumanova became a member of Massine's new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938. She dropped out of the company the next year to appear in the Broadway musical "Stars in Your Eyes," and rejoined de Basil's company for an Australian tour and the New York season that followed it in 1940. She was once again a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1940 to 1942, and during the 1944-45 season, was a star of Ballet Theater.         As she toured the world, Miss Toumanova was accompanied by her mother, Eugenia, one of the most famous of the "ballet mothers" of the 1930's. These mothers went everywhere with their daughters, serving as dressers, laundresses,  cooks and pet keepers. In addition, the mothers were their daughters' fiercest partisans and sternest critics. Eugenia Toumanova was also said to be fond of fortune telling, faith healing and poker playing.         When, as a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Miss Toumanova was cast in the virtuosic Black Swan pas de deux from "Swan Lake," she and her mother would minutely inspect the stage to choose the spot at which the ballerina would perform a notoriously difficult series of whipping turns known as fouettes. Then they would pray over that spot. The fouettes never faltered. Grace Robert, an American dance historian, said of the Black Swan in her "Borzoi Book of Ballets" (1946): "Tamara Toumanova is at her exciting best in this tour de force, its vertiginous turns and sustained balances exactly suiting her temperament and forceful technique."         Miss Toumanova's later career, although a distinguished one, did not always seem as remarkable as her youthful achievements. After leaving Ballet Theater, she became a freelance ballerina, appearing with such companies as the Paris Opera Ballet, London Festival Ballet and the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet. During the 1960's, she toured extensively in South America with Vladimir Oukhtomsky as her partner.         She created two notable roles with the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1947, she was a star of "Le Palais de Cristal," the glittering abstract ballet by Balanchine that is known in America as "Symphony in C." Three years later, she displayed her dramatic talents in the title role of Serge Lifar's "Phedre."         Some critics thought Miss Toumanova acquired annoying mannerisms. Reviewing her in the London Festival Ballet production of "Swan Lake" in 1955, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, complained that "her grandiosity (including some incredible bows) smothered the whole work like  so much thick chocolate sauce."         Nevertheless, she remained capable of extraordinary performances. Seeing her  at the Paris Opera in 1950, the American critic Edward Denby wrote in "Dancers,  Buildings and People in the Streets" (1965) that he was distressed by her "careless feet, limp and wormy arms, brutally deformed phrasings" but that his objections vanished when she offered "a few terrifying extensions, a few incisive strokes that counted phenomenally."         "At these moments," he went on, "she had so much vitality she made everyone else look as if they merely crept or scuttled about her while she danced."         Miss Toumanova acted and danced in several movies. She made her screen debut  in "Days of Glory" in 1944. That same year, she married the film's producer and  screen writer, Casey Robinson; the marriage ended in divorce. Miss Toumanova played the ballerina Anna Pavlova in "Tonight We Sing" in 1953 and appeared in "Deep in My Heart" in 1954. She had a starring role in "Invitation to the Dance," a ballet film directed by Gene Kelly in 1955. She was also in Alfred Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" (1966) and Billy Wilder's "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1969).         Miss Toumanova, who became an American citizen in 1944, lived quietly in later years at her home in Beverly Hills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Emma Bowen, a lifelong advocate for community causes and the rights of minorities whose reach extended to Washington, where she challenged broadcasters' and politicians' hiring practices, died last Monday at her home in Washington Heights. She was 81.         Mrs. Bowen was an outspoken advocate of the disenfranchised and vulnerable, particularly the young, as president of the Foundation of Minority Interests. The group was an outgrowth of a volunteer organization, Black Citizens for Fair  Media, that focused on the employment practices of broadcasters and their portrayal of blacks on television.         The group set up advisory boards at WABC-TV and WNBC-TV in 1972. As a result, the stations hired community-affairs directors and took steps to adjust  their programming, employment and training policies. A former neighborhood worker in the mayoral campaign of John V. Lindsay, she was later executive secretary of what is now the city's Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services.         Mrs. Bowen was born in Spartanburg, S.C., and moved to New York during the Depression to live with an aunt. She graduated from Fordham University.         Mrs. Bowen's husband, Marion, died in 1943. She is survived by three daughters, Marian Sanderson of Queens, Antoinette Perlez of Manhattan, and Gloria Jones, also of Queens; a brother, William Smith of Manhattan; four sisters, Lillie Ruth and Christine of Queens, Sarah of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Eunice of Spartanburg; seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Mitford, whose book "The American Way of Death" won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist, died yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Constancia Romilly.         Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction, Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War, against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing, and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures. She even  exposed the odd doings of her sisters.         But it was "The American Way of Death," published in 1963, that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country. Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred  A. Knopf.         The thesis of the book, a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry, was that undertakers had "successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge, macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public."         She explored the changing lexicon of death, in which undertakers had come to  call themselves "funeral directors" and "morticians," coffins had become "caskets," and hearses had become "professional cars." In the new order, she said, flowers were "floral tributes" and corpses were always called "loved ones." One of the results of all this, she said, was that the cost of dying was  rising faster than was the cost of living.         She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers,  much to the dismay of the trade, and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body. She felt strongly that someone's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals.         The New Yorker hailed the book as a "brilliant journalistic case against the  whole funeral industry," and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. But not everyone was pleased. James B. Utt, then a Republican  Congressman from California, a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries, denounced Miss Mitford as "pro-Communist, anti-American." Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book "no doubt will find their way into  the coffers of the Communist Party, U.S.A." Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940's, an experience chronicled in her memoirs, but had quit the party.         Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11, 1917, at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire, England, one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale (David Mitford) and Lady Redesdale, the former Sydney Bowles.         It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity. One of Miss Mitford's five sisters, Pamela, aspired as a child to be a horse. Another, Diana, wanted to be a Fascist and succeeded in becoming the wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, the ranking leader of Britain's Fascists. Another daughter, Unity, went to Germany,  became a disciple of Hitler, shot herself and died nine years later in a nursing home.         Miss Mitford's eldest sister, Nancy, became a novelist, and is best remembered for "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate."         Miss Mitford described her childhood as largely unhappy. She particularly resented that she and her sisters were prevented from going to school because Lady Redesdale did not believe that girls needed it and tutored them at home.         Early in life, Miss Mitford shared a sitting room with her sister Unity, who  adorned it with swastikas. According to her memoirs, Miss Mitford responded by using a diamond ring to carve small hammers and sickles into the windowpanes on her side of the room.         When she was 19, she ran away from home with a second cousin, Esmond Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill. Because she eloped, she was cut out of her father's will. In 1939, Miss Mitford quit her job as a market researcher in the  London office of J. Walter Thompson and moved to the United States with her husband. He joined the Canadian Air Force after the war broke out and was killed in action in 1941.         Miss Mitford was a union organizer, a bartender at a Miami restaurant, a clerk in a Washington dress shop and a typist and later an investigator at the Office of Price Administration in World War II.         In 1943, she married Robert E. Treuhaft, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and the couple moved to Oakland, Calif. When Miss Mitford was 38, she decided that she would become a writer. She had largely failed at her other jobs, she wrote, and  "I figured that the only thing that requires no education and no skills is writing."         She produced her first book, "Life itselfmanship," in 1956. It was privately  published and had little circulation. Her second effort, "Daughters and Rebels," an autobiography, was published in 1960 and won praise from the critics. Her next book was "The American Way of Death," which remained on the best-seller list for a year.         Late in life, she was asked what sort of funeral she wanted. An elaborate one, she replied, with "six black horses with plumes and one of those marvelous  jobs of embalming that take 20 years off." She added that she wanted "streets to be blocked off, dignitaries to declaim sobbingly over the flower-smothered bier, proclamations to be issued -- that sort of thing."         Her other books attracted much attention, although none as much as "The American Way of Death." She also wrote "The Trial of Dr. Spock, William Sloan Coffin Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin" (1969), five who were accused of aiding and abetting those who sought to violate the Selective Service Act. Among her other books were "Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business" (1973), a study of American prisons, which she found wanting in almost everything except brutality; "A Fine Old Conflict" (1977), a memoir of her Communist days; "Poison Penmanship: The Gentle Art of Muckraking" (1979), and "The American Way of Birth" (1992), in which she accused doctors of doing too many Caesarean sections and of not paying enough attention to the possibilities  offered by midwifery.         She also wrote articles for Life, Esquire, The Nation and The San Francisco Chronicle.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; a  son, Benjamin Treuhaft of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Deborah Devonshire of Chatsworth, England, and Diana Mosley of Paris, and three grandchildren.         Correction:         An obituary of the writer Jessica Mitford on Wednesday omitted the titles of  her surviving sisters and misidentified the hometown of one. One sister is Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire. Her hometown is Bakewell, in Darbyshire; Chatsworth is the name of her house. The other sister is Lady Diana Mosley.         An obituary on July 24 about the writer Jessica Mitford misstated the relative ages of her and her sisters. Ms. Mitford was the second youngest of six daughters. Her sister Deborah was the youngest.       
         Geraldine Bone Zorbaugh, a lawyer who was a trailblazer for women in the upper ranks of broadcast networks' legal staffs in the 1950's, died on Saturday  at Moore Regional Hospital in Pinehurst, N.C. She was 91 and lived in a retirement home in Pinehurst.         Mrs. Zorbaugh worked as a secretary in her hometown, Barnesboro, in central Pennsylvania, and later in New York City, where she met her husband, had two children, graduated from law school and became prominent as a network lawyer, first at ABC.         When she was promoted to acting general counsel at ABC in 1951, Fortune magazine said she was the first woman to achieve high rank in her field. She became general counsel and a vice president, both firsts for a woman, in 1956.         Mrs. Zorbaugh moved from ABC to CBS in 1957, becoming general attorney for radio as well as a vice president. She retired in 1968.         "She was a pioneer for women in management in broadcasting, and she used her  position to help other women" Eleanor R. Applewhaite, vice president and general counsel of Thirteen/WNET, the public television station, said yesterday.         Ms. Applewhaite, who is black and was hired by Mrs. Zorbaugh in 1964 for the  radio section of CBS's law department, said: "When she hired me, I don't think there was another black attorney at any of the networks. She had a very caring attitude for the people who worked for her."         After graduating from high school in Barnesboro and working there, Mrs. Zorbaugh came to New York. She studied at the Washington Square College of New York University while being paid for grading papers and exams at the education school at New York University.         In 1929, she married Harvey W. Zorbaugh, a university faculty member who became chairman of the department of educational sociology. She dropped out of college for two years -- during which her son, Harvey, was born -- and then returned and received her bachelor's degree in 1932.         After college she worked as a secretary in the radio industry, at the Blue Network, and, as Ms. Applewhaite said, "after observing what the lawyers were doing, she went to law school," in 1938.         Mrs. Zorbaugh went on to work as a lawyer with a New York law firm and with the Blue Network before joining ABC in 1944.         Professor Zorbaugh died in 1965.         In addition to her son, of Columbia, Md., and her daughter, Anne Allen of East Windsor, N.J., she is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Nanette Bearden, the founder and artistic director of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater, died on Aug. 10 at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island. She was 69 and had homes in Manhattan and on St. Martin in the French West Indies.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Dorothy Dow, a sister.         Ms. Bearden was an energetic supporter of fledgling black choreographers and small modern-dance companies and produced their work in a series, Broadway Dance Festival, in 1975 and 1976. Her own modern-dance company, founded in 1976 as the Chamber Dance Group, presented simple stage productions for dances by black choreographers who included Walter Rutledge, Gary DeLoatch, Walter Raines, William Scott and Roumel Reaux. The company also performed dances by such leading choreographers as Alvin Ailey, Talley Beatty, Fred Benjamin, George Faison and Dianne McIntyre.         Born on Staten Island, Ms. Bearden studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and was a model with the Ophelia DeVore Agency. She trained in dance at the Martha Graham school, at Clark Center and at the Luigi Dance Center and performed from 1971 to 1974 with the New World Dancers. She was also a promoter of visual arts in the French West Indies.         Ms. Bearden's husband, the artist Romare Bearden, died in 1988. Besides Mrs. Dow, she is survived by six other sisters, Evelyn Jackson and Marie, Sheila and Delores Rohan, all of Staten Island and St. Martin; Annette Rohan of Bellflower, Calif., and Gloria Elboushi of Long Beach, Calif.       
         Vivian Robinson, the founder of the Audience Development Committee (Audelco) and the annual Audelco Awards, which honors achievement in black theater, died on Sept. 16 at North General Hospital in Harlem. She was 71.         The cause was heart failure, said Fred Powell, chairman of the board of Audelco.         Miss Robinson was born in Portsmouth, Va. While working in the advertising department of The Amsterdam News, she noticed that many small theater companies were not being covered and volunteered to review their productions for the newspaper. In 1973, she created Audelco ''to generate recognition, understanding and awareness of the arts in black communities and to build new audiences for nonprofit theaters and dance companies.''         For 23 years, the Audelco ceremony has been an annual event in the New York theater, with awards presented to playwrights, actors, directors, composers, designers and theater companies. Under Miss Robinson's direction, Audelco has also sponsored a series of Black Theater Festivals.         She is survived by her sister, Joan Rodriquez of Yonkers.       
         Ljuba Welitsch, the flame-haired Bulgarian-born soprano whose career was highlighted by her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Salome'' in 1949, died on Monday in a hospital in Vienna. Miss Welitsch, who had become an Austrian citizen, was 83.         The cause of death was a series of strokes, said Herta Wiedenhuber, the executor of her estate.         Miss Welitsch's performance in the title role of the Richard Strauss opera on Feb. 4, 1949, was regarded as one of the most memorable in Metropolitan Opera history. The packed house had turned out mainly to hear Fritz Reiner make his Met debut as a conductor, but by the time the performance ended, with at least 15 minutes of cheering and whistling from an ecstatic audience, Miss Welitsch had become an international star.         ''Miss Welitsch is a musician and interpreter of flaming temperament, who has the part absolutely in her hand,'' Olin Downes wrote in his review in The New York Times the next day. ''She is an actress of individuality and power.''         A few days later, Miss Welitsch dazzled the critics again, displaying her versatility in the title role of Verdi's ''Aida'' and prompting Howard Taubman of The Times to call her ''one of the few perfect singers to come to the Met in recent years.''         But Miss Welitsch's extensive repertory and her determination to make up for the years on the international stage that she had lost during World War II shortened her operatic career. She drove her voice mercilessly, and by the mid-1950's, critics seemed to agree that her best singing was behind her.         At the Met, she appeared in 63 performances between her debut and her final appearance, in the nonsinging role of the Duchesss of Krakenthorp in Donizetti's ''Fille du Regiment'' on Feb. 17, 1972.         Besides Salome and Aida, her Metropolitan Opera roles included Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' the title role in Puccini's ''Tosca,'' Rosalinde in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus'' and Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme.''         But most of Miss Welitsch's career was spent in Europe, where she was coached by the composer when she made her Vienna Opera debut in a special performance of ''Salome'' that celebrated Richard Strauss's 80th birthday in 1944.         Even when her career in grand opera faded, Miss Welitsch's love of performance kept her busy into the early 1980's in operetta, films, radio, television and on the stage.         She was born in Borissovo, on the Black Sea in Bulgaria, on July 10, 1913. As a child, she liked to sing and play the violin. By her teens she was taking singing lessons, and at 19 entered the Academy of Music in Vienna.         She began her professional career in 1936 with the Graz Opera Company, which played a 10-month season that enabled Miss Welitsch to build her repertory. From 1941 to 1943 she sang in Hamburg and from 1943 to 1946 in Munich. In 1943 she also joined the Vienna Opera, where she made her noteworthy debut in ''Salome'' the next year.         When she made her English debut with the company in 1947, she dazzled audiences at Covent Garden, and by 1948 she had sung Salome more than 50 times and appeared in more than 40 other roles. That summer, while abroad, Edward Johnson, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard Miss Welitsch and engaged her to sing in New York the following year.         In 1956, when she was 43, Miss Welitsch caused a stir in Vienna when she married Karl Schmalvogel, a 29-year-old traffic policeman who had assisted her after an accident a year earlier. They were divorced in 1969.         Miss Welitsch left no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Durham Cuyjet, a pioneering teacher of black dancers, died on Oct. 22 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Mrs. Cuyjet was 76 and lived in Philadelphia.         She had been suffering from cardiopulmonary disorders, according to her son, Stephen Cuyjet Jr.         Mrs. Cuyjet's most famous pupil was Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Ms. Jamison began training in ballet at the age of 6 with ''Miss Marion,'' as everyone called Mrs. Cuyjet (pronounced soo-zhay).         In addition to teaching classical ballet and other dance techniques,  Mrs. Cuyjet taught her students that ''dancers were not hybrid creatures dropped down from the clouds with no relation to earth,'' as Ms. Jamison noted in her autobiography, ''Dancing Spirit.''         Mrs. Cuyjet also provided subliminal lessons in determination and race relations. ''She looked Caucasian and rented studio space that landlords would not rent to a person they thought was black,'' Ms. Jamison wrote. ''She broke the color barrier and was constantly evicted once black children were discovered on the premises; she had to move her school seven times.''         Born in Cheswold, Del., Mrs. Cuyjet studied ballet in Philadelphia with Essie Marie Dorsey, herself a student of Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, and opened the Judimar School in 1948. Mrs. Cuyjet created dances for public events in the city, and in the late 1950's was the principal choreographer for the annual Christmas Cotillion sponsored by Heritage House, a leading black cultural organization in Philadelphia.         From 1958 into the 1970's, Mrs. Cuyjet was on the dance faculty at Maryland State College (now the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore) and also taught at Delaware State College in Dover, and Cheney State University in Cheney, Pa. She closed her studio in 1971 and trained as a movement therapist, working at the Philadelphia State Hospital for 11 years. She was also a dance panelist on the Pennsylvania State Arts Council.         Mrs. Cuyjet's husband, Stephen, died in 1980. In addition to her son, Stephen Jr., of San Diego, she is survived by a daughter, Judith Coldvin, of Marlton, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Philadelphia; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Former Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota, a fierce champion of family farms, medical research and campaign finance reform and the creator of Federal student loans, died at a nursing home in Edina, Minn., on Thursday, her legislative achievements all but overshadowed by her vindictive husband's ''Coya, Come Home'' campaign that led to her defeat after two terms in 1958. She was 82.         Her son, Terry, said the cause was kidney failure.         If there had ever been any doubts that a woman's place is in the House, they must surely have been dispelled in 1954 when the former Coya Gjesdal unseated a six-term Republican and swept into Congress like a whirlwind from northern Minnesota.         There had been women in Congress continuously for more than 30 years, and Mrs. Knutson, although the first from Minnesota, was one of seven elected in 1954. But it is safe to say that the House had never seen anything quite like her.         A Norwegian immigrant's daughter who grew up on a North Dakota farm, graduated from Concordia College in 1934 and spent a year studying voice and piano at the Juilliard School before returning to North Dakota to teach school, she married in 1940 and settled in the little town of Oklee, Minn., just across the state line.         She and her husband operated a small hotel cum cafe until Mrs. Knutson, a populist inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt, got the political bug and made a successful run for the Minnesota Legislature in 1950.         A tireless campaigner who accompanied herself on the accordion while singing her own campaign song in a lilting soprano, she stunned the Minnesota political establishment when she won the 1954 Congressional election, and when she got to Washington she stunned Congress even more.         Despite her lack of seniority, Mrs. Knutson promptly won a place on the House Agriculture Committee. She subsequently initiated the first Federal appropriations for cystic fibrosis research, introduced the first bill calling for the income tax checkoff to finance Presidential election campaigns and originated the idea and the legislation that established the Federal student loan program.         Mrs. Knutson was an independent-minded woman, and she made her share of political enemies along the way. But, despite opposition from some leaders of her own Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, she appeared headed for a long and brilliant career in Congress as her second term drew to a close.         Then, in May 1958, when her party declined to formally endorse Mrs. Knutson for a third term, forcing her to run in a primary to seek re-election, Andy Knutson, the farmhand she had married 18 years earlier, dropped a bombshell.         In an open letter to his wife, he urged her to leave Congress and return to what he described as the ''happy home we once enjoyed.''         Never mind that Mr. Knutson, who had once worked on her father's farm in North Dakota, had not shared a bedroom with his wife for years or that he had regularly beaten her so badly during her visits to Minnesota, as their son later recalled it, that she had to wear dark glasses to hide her black eyes from her fellow members of Congress.         Once the resulting ''Coya, Come Home,'' newspaper headline was carried across the country, it created a firestorm of publicity that accepted Mr. Knutson's story as the plaintive truth and portrayed his wife as an uncaring wife who had abandoned her family for political ambition.         Mr. Knutson later stirred the fire by accusing his wife of having an affair with a legislative aide half her age, but although the charge was a blatant fabrication, Mrs. Knutson refused to denounce her husband.         She managed to win the primary, but lost the general election by 1,390 votes to Odin Langen, a Republican who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and campaigned on the slogan, ''A Big Man for a Man-Sized Job.'' There was never any doubt that the ''Coya, Come Home,'' campaign had cost Mrs. Knutson the election, and as it turned out, her political career.         She failed in a comeback bid in 1960, divorced her husband in 1962, and then spent a dozen years working in the Defense Department in Washington before trying another abortive race in 1977, polling 13 percent of the vote in a primary in which one of her opponents was her former legislative aide.         According to her son, who was adopted when he was 8 over the objections of his father, Mrs. Knutson, a deeply religious woman who frequently cited the biblical passage, ''Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord,'' never expressed bitterness toward her husband.         But she was also apparently content to leave forgiveness to the Lord. When Mr. Knutson died of acute alcohol poisoning in 1969, she did not attend his funeral.         Besides her son, of Bloomington, Minn., Mrs. Knutson is survived by two sisters, Helen Riets of Devil's Lake, N.D., and Crystal Greguson of Edina, two grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         At 94, Brooke Astor is giving up giving away money.         After more than 30 years of overseeing a foundation that has donated $175 million in New York City, to world-renowned cultural institutions and tiny neighborhood service programs, Mrs. Astor says she wants more time to travel and write poetry. She has decided to close the Vincent Astor Foundation, and will give away its remaining $25 million by the end of next year.         While there are many larger philanthropic foundations, few have become so entwined in the fabric of the city's life, because of Mrs. Astor's role as a social arbiter and her determination to focus her efforts on New York.         She also set a standard for personal involvement in philanthropy. Determined to know every group that received money, Mrs. Astor personally visited hundreds of organizations, from the New York Public Library to a modest program that gives furniture to formerly homeless families.         That effort began when Mrs. Astor visited two families who had been homeless and had then moved into apartments in Queens with almost no furniture.         ''How can you build a new life if you don't have any furniture?'' Mrs. Astor said. ''To move into a place and just sit there with a bag and not even have a teacup is terrible.''         She mobilized a group of nonprofit agencies and foundations to support a fledgling organization called Furnish a Future, which provides furniture at low cost for such families.         Even her giving to the city's leading institutions, including $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an equivalent sum sum to the New York Public Library, has been characterized by a concern for individuals, those who know her say.         Most recently, the foundation gave $250,000 for a room for the staff of the new Science, Business and Industry Library on 34th Street, and just last week she gave her annual Christmas lunch for more than 1,000 employees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University, who was president of the New York Public Library from 1980 to 1988, said Mrs. Astor ''has given equal attention to janitors and guards as to librarians and curators and the rich and famous.''         Shelby White, a trustee and a donor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said: ''She set the pattern for making philanthropy socially desirable. She was the model that everyone aspired to. But she did not do it to climb social ladders. After all, she was already on top.''         In an interview at the offices of the Vincent Astor Foundation on Park Avenue, Mrs. Astor, dressed in a black Valentino suit, wide-brimmed black hat and strands of pearls, said that during 1997 she would decide how to give away the rest of the money. The recipients will primarily be education oriented, Mrs. Astor said, with existing recipients getting most of the money.         ''But we're not telling anybody what we're doing,'' Mrs. Astor said, smiling mischievously. ''We don't know ourselves yet.''         As to why she chose this moment to close down the foundation, she said simply, ''Age.''         She said she had had a wonderful time running the foundation, but added: ''I don't think I can do as much as I used to, and couldn't do it as well. I would like to have one year, before I dance into my grave, of doing something good for myself.''         Mrs. Astor, who was brought up in China, said that she wanted to make one more trip there. Now that she has taken to writing poetry -- she has had two poems published in The New Yorker -- she said she hopes to spend more time writing.         Mrs. Astor said she had considered keeping the foundation going with someone else at the helm, but decided against it.         ''My son is not an Astor,'' she said, referring to her son, Tony Russell, from an earlier marriage. ''There is no family to leave it to. If you have children, like the Rockefellers did, you leave it to your children. If you have no children, I think it is a nice idea to close it.''         For his part, Mr. Russell said he supported his mother's decision, noting how difficult it would have been to take over an effort so strongly identified with her. ''I would hate to second-guess, 'Is this something that my mother would like to give to?' '' he said.         Mrs. Astor's efforts began in earnest in 1959, when her third husband, Vincent Astor, died, leaving the foundation assets of $67 million.         The decision to focus the foundation's philanthropy on New York was hers. The foundation's only mandate was ''the alleviation of human misery,'' but Mrs. Astor decided that since the Astor family money derived in part from New York City real estate, she wanted to return it to the city.         ''The mandate has been pretty straightforward,'' said Linda Gillies, the foundation's director. ''Housing, literacy, the arts and some planning and landmarks.''         From the beginning, Mrs. Astor was deeply and personally involved.  Marjory Rice, the director of Furnish a Future, said Mrs. Astor has appeared at functions for the organization and helped raise money. ''It creates a wonderful stir of excitement,'' she said. ''It is is sort of like having a wonderful magic wand.''         Another favorite cause has been the Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School, which lets young people who have dropped out of high school and started working  get a high school diploma. Its founder and principal, Howard Friedman, wrote to the Astor foundation in 1989 seeking money for a library. Mrs. Astor spent a day visiting the school, and since then the school has received $50,000.         ''She spent hours there,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''I got worried because it was so hot and she was going up and down the stars from room to room. She started speaking Chinese with the Chinese students. She really bonded with students. From that we developed a relationship.''         Mrs. Astor said she was struck by the students' efforts to help themselves. ''They were the sort of children who wanted to do something but did not have the proper education, and they realized that,'' she said.         The Astor foundation has been known for spreading its wealth over a wide range of causes. Of the $1.58 million the foundation gave away in 1995, 105 of the total of 111 grants were between $1,000 and $50,000.         Mrs. Astor is best known for her affiliation with the New York Public Library. During the 1980's, she resigned from the boards of Rockefeller University and the Bronx Zoo to work more intensely for the library.         Mr. Gregorian said that one approach he and Mrs. Astor settled on to raise money was to convince people that being associated with the library was good for them.         ''People don't add class to the library,'' he said. ''It was the library that added class to them. To serve the library is to service civilization, culture and democracy. It is the only institution that can be populist and elitist.''         Mrs. Astor has been able to meld the worlds of society and accomplishment in an unusually public way. Mr. Gregorian recalled that when Mrs. Astor gave a dinner for the library, she invited virtually the same people she had recently invited to a party for President Reagan.         The library's chairwoman, Elizabeth Rohatyn, said it was hard to imagine the future without Mrs. Astor's involvement. But, she said, ''With the reflection of her vast interest, the library has evolved into a very strong institution.''         The Astor foundation will close down in a year, but Mrs. Astor is unlikely to forsake her role at the center of New York life. ''I adore people,'' she said.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An article on Wednesday about Brooke Astor's plans to close the Vincent Astor Foundation misidentified her son, who expressed support for his mother's decision against leaving it in his hands or someone else's. He is Anthony D. Marshall, not Tony Russell.       
         Suzanne Railey, a representative for Christie's auction house who was known for her talents as an international hostess, died last weekend in her Manhattan apartment. She was 85.         She died in her sleep, Ed Gallagher, a longtime friend, told Christie's. She had a list of guests for her next dinner party at her bedside, he said.         Ms. Railey, who was known as Sue, lived most of her life in Paris and New York, and had been employed by Christie's in New York since March 1985. She was a public relations ambassador of sorts. Her only  role for the auction house was to hold a black-tie dinner party at her home each month, drawing on her long list of wealthy and influential friends, many with extensive art collections. The idea was to generate good will, and eventually business, for the auction house.         Seated at the tables in her two bedroom apartment in the East 60's  would be diplomats, society doyennes and fashion designers.         ''It all depends who's in town and what I'm thinking about,'' Ms. Railey said during an interview last week.         The jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent dinner guest at her house, said: ''You never knew who you'd be seated next to. She always had good people. And her apartment was amazing, with more objects than you could count on every table and mirrors on the ceilings.''         Entertaining and collecting were what she enjoyed.         ''You must talk to me about dinner parties,'' Ms. Railey said, standing at Alexis Gregory's dinner party on Dec. 2, clutching a black pocketbook with a big white clock on top. ''I love them so much. It's just so much more attractive to entertain at home. You can actually sit and talk.''         Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's, said, ''Her apartment was filled with all these treasures of Europe.'' She collected portraits from the French Revolutionary period, miniatures and African works of art, and also had a large collection of letter seals.         She was born Suzanne Rosenberg in Rochester. Her family owned a department store. As a young girl she traveled to Manhattan, Washington and Paris with her parents, said David Granger, a longtime friend.         She lived in Manhattan during part of her 20's with an uncle, Ed Goodman, who owed Finchley's, a men's clothing store. Mr. Granger said, ''And she did what popular young girls do, she traveled and went to parties.''         Then she moved to Washington,  where she started Overcoats for Britain, a program shipping coats to England during World War II.         In 1950, she married Howard Barclay Railey, a businessman who was attached to the American Embassy in Paris. For the next 33 years, she lived and entertained in ''a romantic apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris,'' said Ethel de Croisset, a close friend who lives in Paris.         ''She was a born brilliant hostess,'' she said. ''She was always friends with all the ambassadors.'' When her husband died, Ms. Railey moved back to Manhattan and began working for Christie's.         She is survived by two stepsons.

         Barbara Jordan, the black Congresswoman and scholar who stirred the nation with her Churchillian denunciations of the Watergate abuses of President Richard M. Nixon, died today in her home state of Texas at the age of 59.         Afflicted with multiple sclerosis, Ms. Jordan died from viral pneumonia as a  complication of leukemia, according to officials of the University of Texas in Austin, where she taught.         Ms. Jordan, the first black elected to Congress from Texas after Reconstruction, retired from the House in 1979 after three terms to teach political ethics at the university's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, never losing her potent talent for public speaking even from the confines of a wheelchair.         Most recently, her rich, impassioned voice was heard once more in Congress when, as chairwoman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, she spoke out last  year against a proposal to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants born in this country. "To deny birthright citizenship would derail this engine of American liberty," she warned with the same eloquence that mesmerized her American audience on July 25, 1974, when Representative Jordan argued for the impeachment of President Nixon.         Ms. Jordan, whom her students recalled as never being without a copy of the Constitution in her purse, rooted that Watergate speech in her faith in the Constitution's promise and in her personal history as a child of the Jim Crow South.         "I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton  just left me out by mistake," she declared, catching the nation's attention with measured, sepulchral oratory from her seat on the House Judiciary Committee. "But through the process of amendment, interpretation and court decision I have  finally been included in 'We, the people.' "         Then, with a smoldering glance across the proceedings of the historic Constitutional crisis, Ms. Jordan added, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total, and I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution."         Ms. Jordan was one of American politics' pioneer black women. In 1966, she was elected as the first black state Senator in Texas, and went on to be the first woman and first black elected to Congress from Texas. In 1976, she was the first black woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, riveting her audience on national television as she spoke magisterially from the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden.         "All blacks are militant in their guts," she told an interviewer during her first Congressional campaign. "But militancy is expressed in different ways."         As a model of the Democratic politician from the New South, Ms. Jordan was less an angry or confrontational liberal than an imposing master of the process  and its details. A consummate politician from her earliest days in the Texas Legislature, Ms. Jordan won a seat on the House Judiciary Committee though only  a freshman by importuning her political mentor and friend, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, to pull some strings.         "She proved that black is beautiful before we knew what it meant," Mr. Johnson said of her. His widow, Lady Bird Johnson, led Texans in mourning their  native daughter. "I feel a stabbing sense of loss at the passing of a good friend," Mrs. Johnson said today.         Ms. Jordan's political prowess saw her ascend to the post of Speaker pro tem  in the Texas Senate six years after having arrived there as a political oddity and an outcast.         The youngest of three sisters, Barbara Charline Jordan was born on Feb. 21, 1936, into the poverty of Houston's Fourth Ward. She attended Houston's segregated public schools and graduated magna cum laude with debating honors from the all-black Texas Southern University. Her father, Benjamin, a Baptist minister, moonlighted as a warehouse clerk to help her pay for college, where her scholarship and assertiveness were honed.         As leader of the debating team, Ms. Jordan, known as B. J. to her friends, later proudly recalled maneuvering the Harvard team to a draw. "When an all-black team ties Harvard, it wins," she said.         Ms. Jordan received a law degree in 1959 from Boston University and was soon  at practice from her family's dining-room table. Eventually, she had a second-story office above a print shop near her family's simple frame house.         "I never wanted to be run of the mill," she told Molly Ivins, the Texas writer who was a friend since 1969 and likened interviewing Ms. Jordan to "a bit like grilling God" because of the care, scholarship and booming authority of her speech.         "We were poor," Ms. Jordan said of her strict but loving upbringing. "But so  was everyone around us, so we did not notice it."         When Miss Jordan was 11, she quit her piano lessons -- a defiant act that angered her father. He told her that the only good jobs for black women were in  teaching music or in performing, and asked her what she intended to do if she could not play the piano. "I don't know," she recalled telling him, "but I'll manage somehow."         As a Congressional newcomer, Ms. Jordan served notice that she had received 80 percent of the vote and would therefore have far broader interests than the Black Caucus agenda, and would hardly be a "female chauvinist."         "You know, Barbara wasn't really that concerned about the guilt or innocence  of Nixon," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who served with Ms. Jordan on the impeachment hearings. "She was most concerned that the Constitution not be distorted for political reasons."         Some of Ms. Jordan's earliest politicking was as a young lawyer when she directed one of Houston's first voter drives in support of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960. She lost her first two bids for elective office in rough-and-tumble, racism-tinged bouts. But she succeeded when state legislative  districts were finally redrawn and she became the first black of either sex to be elected to the Texas Senate since 1883.         Even amid the political turmoil of 1974, when Congresswoman Jordan contended  that the Watergate conspirings had put the nation "on the edge of repression and tyranny," the outspoken Texan still led with her optimism. During that summer of the Watergate crisis, she took care to visit the graduates of Howard University  and urge them: "Reaffirm what ought to be. Get back to the truth; that's old, but get back to it. Get back to what's honest; tell government to do that. Affirm the civil liberties of the people of this country. Do that."         Ms. Jordan is survived by her mother, Arylenne; two sisters, Bennie Creswell  and Rose Mary McGowan, and a brother-in-law, John McGowan, all of Houston.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.
