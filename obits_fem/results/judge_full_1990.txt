        Ethel F. Donaghue, one of the first women to practice law in Connecticut, died in her sleep Saturday at her home in West Hartford. She was 93 years old.         Ethel F. Donaghue, one of the first women to practice law in Connecticut, died in her sleep Saturday at her home in West Hartford. She was 93 years old.         Miss Donaghue, a native of Hartford, earned a law degree in 1920 from the University of Pennsylvania and specialized in real-estate and trust law in the Connecticut capital.         A battle over control of her financial affairs, after a series of strokes incapacitated her in 1980, led Probate Judge James H. Kinsella to resign in 1984 to avoid the possibility that he would be the first judge ever impeached by the Connecticut House of Representatives.         Miss Donaghue was one of the state's wealthiest women, having amassed an estate valued in 1978 at $35 million from an inheritance and her earnings.         After her strokes, William W. Graulty, a bank officer who managed her finances, was named her conservator by Judge Kinsella, who also appointed a close friend as co-conservator and his former clerk to oversee them.         Mr. Graulty and the other two had a dispute and another probate judge removed both conservators and accepted the overseer's resignation. In 1983 the state's Probate Council found that Judge Kinsella had acted improperly. A year later, on the day the Connecticut House of Representatives was to vote on impeaching him, Judge Kinsella resigned. The House then voted narrowly to drop the matter.         Miss Donaghue leaves no immediate survivors.       
        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President

        Mildred Scott Olmsted, a longtime antiwar campaigner who was national executive director of a leading pro-disarmament group, died Monday at her home in Rose Valley, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 99 years old.         Mildred Scott Olmsted, a longtime antiwar campaigner who was national executive director of a leading pro-disarmament group, died Monday at her home in Rose Valley, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 99 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Ann Ivey, a colleague.         For 20 years, starting in 1946, Mrs. Olmsted led the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, formed at The Hague in 1915. She was also active in the women's suffrage movement from the early 1900's, and later in life became active in the civil rights movement.         In 1961 she began a series of exchange seminars between the United States section of the league and the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union, a group sponsored by the Soviet Government.         Two months ago Mrs. Olmsted received a lifetime achievement award from the City of Philadelphia, and in 1986 she received the women's league's Peace and Freedom Award.         She was born in Glenolden, Pa., and graduated from Smith College in 1912. In World War I she was a social worker with the Y.W.C.A. in France and Germany. In France she met Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and first president of the women's league, whose example inspired Mrs. Olmsted to work for peace.         Her husband, Allen Olmsted, a Pennsylvania judge who was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, died in 1976.         Mrs. Olmsted is survived by a son, Anthony, of West Goshen, Pa.; a daughter, Enid Burke, of Springfield, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren.

         Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a scholar of Jewish life and history whose book "The War Against the Jews" is widely regarded as a pioneering study of the Nazi genocide, died early Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, the daughter of Polish immigrants, was at the center of the study of the modern Jewish experience at Yeshiva University, where she held a chair in interdisciplinary Holocaust studies. Early in her career, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, she went to Europe, where she helped Jewish survivors of the war to re-create schools and libraries, and she recovered vast collections of books seized by the Nazis.         Before that, while in her early 20's, she had lived in Vilna, Poland, from 1938 to 1939, where she witnessed the onslaught of European anti-Semitism, writing about the experience in a memoir, "From That Place and Time," published by W. W. Norton last year. Her other books include "The Jewish Presence" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich) in 1977 and "The Holocaust and the Historians" (Harvard University Press), a critical survey of scholarship on the Holocaust, in 1981. Hopes Turn to Agonies         "There was a certain irony to my trip to Vilna," Mrs. Dawidowicz told an interviewer for Publisher's Weekly last year, speaking of her pre-war experience in Poland. "I went there with the romantic belief that it might become the world center for a self-sustaining Yiddish culture."         When she saw what turned out to be the beginning of the end of Jewish life in Poland, she immersed herself in Yiddish literature and Jewish history, so that she could help to preserve Jewish culture in the postwar world.         Mrs. Dawidowicz (pronounced dah-vee-DOH-vich), a small energetic woman who spoke in the accents of the Bronx, engaged in heated arguments within Jewish circles over both the nature of the Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent it.         Her major work, "The War Against the Jews," postulates that the destruction of the Jews was a central and inescapable element in Nazi ideology and was always a principle war aim of Hitler, just as important as his military conquest of Europe. In this view, she conflicted with other historians, who believed that the Holocaust was not a necessary part of the Nazi program but evolved in response to such circumstances as the defeats on the Eastern front.  Evidence Over Passion         "The War Against the Jews" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston) was called "a work of high scholarship and profound moral import" by Irving Howe, in his review in The New York Times Book Review. It is marked above all by its sobriety. Mrs. Dawidowicz allows the coolly accumulated weight of detail -- the growing force of the Nazi's anti-Semitic juggernaut, the evolution of the camps as places of scientific murder, the efforts by the victims to hold onto fragments of normal life -- to create its emotional and intellectual impact.         Mrs. Dawidowicz refused to judge the failure of the Jews themselves to mount a more active resistance to the genocide, and in this she clashed bitterly with a number of other historians.         Her belief was twofold. First, she felt it morally inappropriate for those who did not face the persecutions themselves to criticize the behavior of those who did. Second, she felt that in any case, Jewish resistance was doomed to failure. Given the Jews' isolation, their lack of arms and the overwhelming material superiority of their enemies, there was virtually nothing they could have done to alter their fate, she wrote.  Defended Role of Jews         In her book "The Holocaust and the Historians," Mrs. Davidowicz is critical of a number of historians and commentators -- Bruno Bettelheim, Hannah Arendt and Raul Hilberg are among those she mentions -- who described the European Jews during the war as passive, cowardly or, in the case of the Judenrat, set up by the Nazis as self-governing boards in the ghettos, even collaborationist.         Similarly, Mrs. Dawidowicz rejected a chorus of opinion to the effect that Jews in the United States were guilty of complacency and a failure to react effectively to the Holocaust.         In articles in Commentary magazine and The New York Times, she wrote, first, that the Jews here did undertake wipespread efforts to awaken the government and world opinion to the fate of the European Jews. Second, she argued that, in any case, whatever might have been done here, the Jews of Europe were caught in a vise from which virtually no escape was ever possible. The only way to save them, she believed, was to militarily defeat the Nazis as quickly as possible, and that fact justified the Allies' concentration on the war effort, rather than on efforts to save the Jews.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, whose maiden name was Lucy Schildkret, was born in New York in 1915 and educated at Hunter College and Columbia University. She recounts in "From That Time and Place" how she began to work for YIVO's Manhattan branch after her year in Vilna. She met her husband, Szymon Dawidowicz, an escapee from Poland there. Mr. Dawidowicz died in 1979.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, who had no children, is survived by her sister, Eleanor Sapak.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Alexandra Gardiner Creel, the co-owner of Gardiners Island, believed to be the largest privately owned island in America, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 80 years old and lived in Mill Creek, L.I.         She died of lung disease, said her brother, Robert David Lion Gardiner of Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Creel and her brother inherited the 3,300-acre island on the eastern end of Long Island, which was bestowed on her family by King Charles I in 1639. She was involved in many social and charitable organizations, including the Colonial Dames of America.         Her death may send Gardiners Island back into the courts. Mr. Gardiner, the island's other owner, and Mrs. Creel's daughter, Alexandra Gardiner Creel Goelet of Manhattan, have been arguing for the past decade over zoning and other environmental issues on the island.         In addition to her brother and her daughter, Mrs. Creel is survived by four grandchildren. Her husband, James Randall Creel, a retired judge of the New York City Criminal Court, died in July.       
         Elisabeth Robb Bettman, who taught English at the University of Cincinnati for 25 years, died Nov. 26 at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. She was 72 years old and lived in Cincinnati.         Mrs. Bettman died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Bettman was a director of the Cincinnati Scholarship Foundation, the Cincinnati Council on World Affairs, and Working in Neighborhoods, a group that helps needy families.         She was graduated from Radcliffe College and received master's degrees from Barnard College and the University of Cincinnati.         Her marriage to Judge Gilbert Bettman of Cincinnati ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Louise Bettman of Cincinnati and Helen Cohen of Houston; a son, Gilbert Bettman Jr. of Los Angeles; a sister, Roberta Robb Bratenahl of Pasadena, Calif.; and a granddaughter.
