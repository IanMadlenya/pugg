         Ruth Rawlings Mott, who oversaw an array of charitable organizations, died on Monday at her home in Flint, Mich. She was 97.         Mrs. Mott was the widow and a distant cousin of Charles Stewart Mott, a founder of the General Motors Corporation, financier and philanthropist. With him she was active in the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and other charities in Flint and elsewhere.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Mott established her own charitable organization, the Ruth Mott Fund, which for the last 20 years contributed more than $1 million a year to hundreds of local and national organizations concerned with the arts, the environment, health and international affairs.         Born in El Paso, Mrs. Mott graduated from the Boston School of Physical Education and opened a dance studio in her hometown. She met Mr. Mott, who had been widowed twice, in 1932, and they married in 1934.         Mrs. Mott is survived by a son, Stewart Rawlings Mott of North Salem, N.Y.; a daughter, Maryanne Turnbull Mott of Santa Barbara, Calif.; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Katherine Bain, a pediatrician who became a high-ranking and an outspoken Washington official concerned with the well-being of infants and children, died on Jan. 10 in a Washington nursing home she entered in October. She was 101 and had lived in Washington since 1940.         Dr. Bain's family said that she was the author or a co-author of reports that led to the development of child-proof safety caps for medicines and for chemicals in the home, safety-release standards for the doors of refrigerators in order to keep children from being trapped and suffocated, and some of the first Federal guidelines for the nutrition of children.         Her family said that she had carried out a pioneering survey of breast-feeding practices in American hospitals' nurseries and that her findings had led to changes in doctors' opinions of nursing.         In 1940, she joined the Children's Bureau, an agency that was then part of the Department of Labor and is now part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She was the bureau's deputy chief from 1958 to 1964 and became assistant to the director of the Public Health Service in a reorganization in 1969. She devoted herself to children's welfare issues in foreign countries for the next four years and retired.         In a report in The Journal of Pediatrics in 1954, Dr. Bain presented statistics that pointed up the carelessness of American families in protecting children in the home.         Analyzing data supplied by the National Office of Vital Statistics, she said that 400 children under the age of 5 died each year in the United States from accidental poisoning. That rate was four times the rate reported for England and Wales.         Two-thirds of the deaths from accidental poisoning could be prevented, Dr. Bain said, if aspirin, barbiturates, kerosene, lye, lead and arsenic compounds were kept out of the hands of small children.         In a report issued in 1944, Dr. Bain said that World War II had intensified the need for regular advice to mothers on how to keep their babies well. ''We have a bumper crop of babies,'' she said. ''Nearly three million will be born in the United States this year. At the same time we have a shortage of doctors and nurses for the civilian population. About 50 percent of our younger practicing physicians have gone into the armed forces.'' Dr. Bain said the United States would have to work hard and fast to increase its number of clinics aimed at keeping babies well.         After the war, she bemoaned disparities in medical care available in different parts of the United States. Speaking to 500 child health and welfare experts in 1948 in Chicago, she said that a survey had found ''that 1,000 children in Illinois have on an average day twice as much medical care as 1,000 children in Alabama.''         ''One can only conclude,'' Dr. Bain added, ''that children in Alabama are receiving at the most only one-half as much care as they need.''         The honors Dr. Bain received included an award in 1960 from the New York Infirmary for work she had done in pediatrics and public health.         Dr. Bain was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor's degree in 1920 from the University of Missouri and her medical degree in 1925 from Washington University in St. Louis. She spent 13 years in private pediatric practice in St. Louis before going to Washington.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst specializing in child development and the emotional state of Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.         Dr. Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded 30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of Children.         She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis. Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books used to teach German children about the Holocaust.         Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York Psychological Institute.         Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their children.         They were married in the mid-1940's and became a team in their Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims, especially children, before the courts and found that many of them had only vague memories of their ordeals.         Dr. Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at Long Island Jewish Hospital.         She published seven books and some 150 professional articles. Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ''Children Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).         Her other books in print include ''Sexuality, Body Movement and the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner, ''The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman, ''Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).         Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Dr. Kestenberg is survived by a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr. Fogelman and associates.       
         Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, a Federal judge in the Southern District of New York who was known for her rulings in discrimination cases, died  Saturday at a hospital in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 74 and had homes in the Bronx and Las Vegas.         The cause was heart failure, and she had been in declining health, a daughter, Leslie H. Lowe, said.         Judge Lowe was the second black woman appointed to the Federal judiciary, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. She was recommended by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and appointed by President Carter in 1978. At the time, there were 400 Federal trial judges, 15 of whom were black and 5 of whom were female.         As a senior judge, a status she acquired in 1991, she sat on the bench here for part of the year, and had been doing some judicial work while in Las Vegas.         Earlier, she was a judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York from 1971 until 1973, when she was named an Acting State Supreme Court Justice assigned to the Manhattan Supreme Court's Centralized Narcotics Term. She held that post, sitting in Manhattan, until 1974. She served on the Supreme Court in Bronx County in 1975 and 1976. In 1977 she was elected a justice of the State Supreme Court.         In 1984, in District Court in Manhattan, she issued a widely noted injunction barring New York City from ''refusing to allow homeless individuals to register to vote on the ground that they fail to inhabit traditional residences.'' She said the city's Board of Elections had defined the term ''residence'' to exclude ''an entire group of otherwise eligible voters,'' estimated at the time at 20,000.         In the ruling, she said that voter residency requirements could be satisfied by ''homeless individuals identifying a specific location within a political community which they consider their home base, to which they return regularly, manifest an intent to remain for the present, and from which they can receive messages and be contacted.''         In 1981 she ruled that a New York City pension system, which assumed that women lived three years longer than men, discriminated illegally against women by requiring them to make higher contributions even though they received lower monthly benefits when they retired.         One of the most controversial cases she handled was a 1988 racketeering trial in which the jury convicted eight men, including the reputed former head of the Genovese crime family. The conviction was overturned with unusually harsh language when the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that Judge Lowe had prevented the presentation of important evidence. ''This was an error of constitutional magnitude,'' the appellate judges wrote.         She was a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School. The honors she received included a New York State Bar Association award for her ''outstanding judicial contribution to the criminal justice system.''         Judge Lowe was born in Manhattan and grew up in Harlem. She received a bachelor's degree in 1952  from Hunter College, a law degree with honors in 1954 from Brooklyn Law School, where she was president of her class and the first black editor in chief of the law review, and a master's degree in 1955 from Columbia Law School.         Judge Lowe's marriages to Edward Hatfield Lowe and Ivan A. Michael ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Bess Michael of Washington, and Leslie, of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Edward H. Lowe of Edison, N.J.; a granddaughter; two sisters, Eddie Johnson Carkhum of Teaneck, N.J., and Ann J. Bolton of Los Angeles, and four brothers, Harry Johnson and Dr. James J. Johnson, both of Teaneck, and Dr. John William Johnson and Robert Johnson, both of the Bronx.       
         Dr. Hildegard Elizabeth Peplau, a nursing educator who played a major role in developing the theory and practice of psychiatric and mental health nursing, died on March 17 at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Peplau wrote a seminal text, ''Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic Nursing,''  which was completed in 1948 and published in 1952. It was translated into several languages and left an impact in much of the world.         She introduced the concept of nurse-patient relationship, an interpersonal approach that has since been integrated into nursing education and practice. With this, she was considered a force in elevating nursing to a profession.         Colleagues regarded Dr. Peplau as the ''mother of psychiatric nursing,'' said Dr. Grayce M. Sills, professor emeritus at the Ohio State University College of Nursing and a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing.         Referring to the general acceptance of Dr. Peplau's interpersonal process, Dr. Sills added, ''It has been argued that Dr. Peplau's life and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since Florence Nightingale.''         Dr. Peplau's book was also deemed highly unusual at the time because it had been written by a nurse, without a physician as a co-author. Its English version remains in print with a 1991 edition from Springer.         Dr. Peplau was born in Reading, Pa., and witnessed the deadly influenza epidemic of 1918, which defined her understanding of the impact of illness and death on families.         She graduated from Pottstown Hospital School of Nursing in 1931 and from Bennington College in 1942. She served in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant in World War II and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1947 and a doctorate in education in 1953.         She studied psychology for a certificate from the William Alanson White Institute (1953), and that study inspired her to adapt the interpersonal approach for the nursing profession.         Dr. Peplau directed the graduate program of psychiatric nursing at Columbia Teachers College from 1948 to 1953 and its counterpart at Rutgers University after that. She retired from Rutgers as a professor emeritus in 1974.         She lectured worldwide and wrote articles for many publications. She was also executive director and president of the American Nurses Association, which inducted her into its Hall of Fame last year, and was a board member of the International Council of Nurses, which honored her with its highest award, the Christiane Reimann Prize, in 1997.         Dr. Peplau is survived by a sister, Bertha Reppert, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a foster brother, John D. Forster, of Reading.       
         Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 94.         In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West, as Harriet Waddy was then known, made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging black women to get into uniform.         She said that joining the segregated military ''and accepting a situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not ''a retreat from our fight'' but ''our contribution to its realization.''         The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.         Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.         ''Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''She looked good, and she was well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''         Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.         Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West ''had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand her baggage from the train.''         Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ''all reference to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from official memorandums on information boards. She said that would bring ''less embarrassment to the colored personnel'' and a ''feeling that a forward step has been made toward democracy.''         Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks gain acceptance. She said that military service would give black women a chance to ''show their ability'' and be ''of future benefit to the whole race.''         Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20, 1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later a civilian adviser to the WAC.         She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps center in Oregon.         A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were divorced.         Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs. Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90's. Mrs. Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said, ''The Frank Sinatra song 'My Way' was just perfect.''       
         Estelle Sapir, a Holocaust survivor who won a rare recovery of the family funds she had sought for half a century from a Swiss bank, died on Tuesday at her home in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was 73.         Miss Sapir, who had been in poor health for some time, died of cardiac arrest, her niece Jeannette Bernstein said.         In 1996, Miss Sapir became the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit involving thousands of Holocaust survivors who sought to recover deposits made by their families in Swiss banks.         Testifying before a Senate committee, Miss Sapir became a symbol of the movement to recover these deposits.         After years of denying Miss Sapir's claims that Credit Suisse, a major Swiss bank, was holding a fortune deposited by her father shortly before he died in a concentration camp, last year the bank joined Miss Sapir in announcing that her case had been settled.         Under the terms of a confidentiality agreement, neither party would say how much money was involved, but Swiss news organizations reported the figure to be $500,000.         Credit Suisse said the case set no precedents, but it appears to be the first instance in which a Swiss bank has not insisted that a claimant provide the death certificate of a Holocaust victim who made deposits. Such a requirement, the claimants have long argued, is impossible to satisfy, because the Nazis kept very few records of those who died in concentration camps.         The Sapir family fortune, the precise amount of which has never been determined, was deposited in several banks before the war by Miss Sapir's father, Jozef Sapir, a Jewish businessman from Poland.         Shortly before Mr. Sapir was sent to the Nazi concentration camp at Majdanek, Poland, Miss Sapir said, she was able to speak with him through barbed wire in a detention camp in Southern France.         ''You have to survive,'' she said he told her. ''You'll be O.K., because there's money in the bank.''         He then drilled her repeatedly on the names of the banks where he had spread out assets accumulated from several businesses.         After the war, during which Miss Sapir worked for the French underground, she visited a number of banks in England and France where her father had told her he had left part of his money. The bank accounts were turned over to her without question, she said.         But the Geneva branch of Credit Suisse, saw things differently.         When Miss Sapir asked to collect the money in 1946, the bank manager demanded that she provide her father's death certificate and records of his deposits.         Miss Sapir said that her father's financial records had been lost in the chaos of the war and that there was no death certificate. Credit Suisse  persisted in its demands for documentation.         Miss Sapir never gave up.         ''I felt that my father was always behind me and with me,'' she said after her lawsuit was settled last year. ''When I die and go to heaven, I will see him and say, 'I accomplished it.' ''         Recently, Credit Suisse found a record of a depositor named J. Sapir, which seemed to confirm that Miss Sapir's father had held an account at the bank.         At that point, the bank entered into serious negotiations with Miss Sapir, and she agreed to accept a payment in exchange for withdrawing from the class-action suit against the three major Swiss commercial banks -- Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation.         In announcing the agreement, Credit Suisse suggested that it had settled the case in the absence of direct evidence of how much money Jozef Sapir might have deposited.         ''We found a sufficient basis in the facts, combined with our concern with Miss Sapir, to arrive at today's settlement,'' said Bob O'Brien, the managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston.         Miss Sapir, who was born in Poland, moved to the United States about 30 years ago, her niece said.         In addition to Ms. Bernstein, Miss Sapir is survived by two other nieces, a nephew and several great-nieces and great-nephews. She never married.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Donna Allen, an early standard-bearer of feminism who kept an eye on the news and communications industry from her Washington home, died on July 19 of a heart attack. She was 78.         Her family said she died at a hospital but declined to identify it.         Dr. Allen came to social and political activism as a young woman, organizing farm workers on the West Coast and writing pamphlets for the American Federation of Labor in Washington. In the early 1950's, she became involved with the League of Women Voters, which was scrutinizing the Truman Administration's loyalty program for Government employees.         At the time, there was widespread fear of Communist infiltration and subversion. Dr. Allen strongly objected to loyalty oaths and their general acceptance by the press.         From this, Dr. Allen developed a lifelong interest in communications and the role of women in the field.         On the political side, she was a founder of Women Strike for Peace, which opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, and she served as Washington representative for the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee.         Dr. Allen herself ran afoul of the Un-American Activities Committee in 1965, when it questioned a visa granted to a Japanese law school dean and leading pacifist for an American lecture tour in 1963. She and two others refused to testify at a closed hearing, claiming a constitutional right to an open hearing.         The committee cited the three for contempt of Congress. A United States district judge found them guilty and gave them suspended sentences of four months in prison and $100 fines. Those were overturned on appeal.         In 1972, Dr. Allen founded the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press and started a newsletter, Media Report to Women: What Women Are Doing and Thinking About the Communications Media. She edited Media Report, now a quarterly, until selling it in 1987 to another publisher, but continued as president of the institute at her home to the end, organizing conferences and writing in an effort to get a woman's point of view across in communications here and abroad.         Donna Allen was born in Petoskey, Mich., and graduated in history, with a minor in economics, from Duke University in 1943. She received a master's degree in economics at the University of Chicago in 1953 and a Ph.D. in history at Howard University in 1971, with a dissertation on national health insurance.         Dr. Allen taught grievance procedures and labor economics and history at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in the early 1950's. She assisted Senator Paul H. Douglas, an economist, with an update of his standard text, ''Theory of Wages,'' and wrote briefs for Presidential emergency boards named to resolve railroad labor disputes.         She was the author of ''Fringe Benefits'' (1964) and co-author of ''Communications at the Crossroads: The Gender Gap Connection'' (1988). She was active in the National Women's Political Caucus, the National Organization for Women and the National Women's Party.         Dr. Allen is survived by three daughters, Dana Densmore of Santa Fe, N.M., Indra Allen of San Francisco and Dr. Martha Allen of Washington; a son, Mark, of Memphis; a brother, Donald Rehkopf of Chicago; and three grandchildren. Her marriage to Russel Allen, a resident of Nashville, ended in divorce.         Dr. Allen sat in the audience when the Committee on Un-American Activities delved into the Ku Klux Klan in 1965, representing the group that wanted the House committee abolished. As the investigators sorted out such mysterious denizens as klaliffs, klokards and kludds, Dr. Allen sported a button proclaiming: ''I am not now nor have I ever been a member of H.U.A.C.''         The committee stopped asking questions about Community Party membership in 1969, when it went out of business. Dr. Allen's group henceforth turned itself into the Committee Against Repressive Legislation, of which she became vice chairman in 1975.       
         Joan Wight, the widow of the Yorkshire veterinarian who wrote under the name James Herriot and the model for a character in his books and television programs based on them, died on Wednesday. She was in her 80's.         Ms. Wight's health slowly declined after her husband died in 1995 at age 78, said Thomas McCormack, the former editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, which published the first five Herriot books.         Her husband, whose real name was James Alfred Wight, vividly depicted his wife as the endearing and supportive Helen Herriot in his memoirs, beginning with ''All Creatures Great and Small.'' Mr. McCormack described Ms. Wight as the model for ''the humorous, loving and, from time to time, tolerating wife of James Herriot.''         ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became the basis for a long-running television series, which was originally a BBC-TV production and later a cable television series in the United States. Its accounts of rural life attracted an audience of millions around the world.         On television, Helen was played first by Carol Drinkwater and later by Lynda Bellingham. In a 1979 movie, ''All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' Helen was portrayed by Lisa Harrow.         Although ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became a best seller, it was not reviewed until months after its publication, when strongly positive word-of-mouth reports had begun to make it famous.         One episode in the first Herriot book describes how Ms. Wight met her future husband. She grew up on a farm in Yorkshire not far from ''the surgery,'' as Mr. Wight's veterinary hospital was known.         One day, she brought in a calf with a broken leg. Mr. Wight repaired the damage with a splint. Later, she brought in a dog with a dislocated hip, and this time, he had eyes only for her. They soon became engaged.         ''A characteristic scene comes in the final chapter of 'All Creatures Great and Small,' '' Mr. McCormack said. ''The scene tells of Joan's and James's honeymoon, which is interrupted by a sudden, mad crush of work, which kills their hope of taking a trip. As Joan sits with notebook on her knee and pencil at the ready, she smiles. It was a magnificent, loving ending.''         Ms. Wight is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Rosemary Page, both of Yorkshire in northern England.       
         Altina Schinasi Miranda, who is credited with designing the flared-frame Harlequin eyeglasses, which first came into vogue in the late 1930's and which have made kitschy comebacks from time to time, died on Thursday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 92.         Mrs. Miranda came up with the idea for the pointy glasses while working as a window display designer on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In an optician's window nearby, she noticed the humdrum round eyeglasses for women and decided to design something different.         Her new glasses were initially rejected by the major manufacturers, but Mrs. Miranda allied herself with a stylish optical shop, Lugene, on Madison Avenue, where one of the first pairs was sold to the writer Clare Boothe Luce. Other New York trendsetters followed Mrs. Luce's lead, and by the late 1930's, Harlequin glasses were the rage.         Mrs. Miranda's glasses were hailed by magazines like Vogue and Life, and she decided to establish her own company to distribute them. In 1939 she received an American Design Award from Lord & Taylor for the Harlequins, which remained fashionable through the 1950's and enjoyed a resurgence of hip popularity in the early 1990's.         ''If you look at any 'I Love Lucy' rerun, if Lucille Ball is wearing glasses, they are Harlequin glasses,'' said David Mayhew of Maplewood, N.J., a friend of Mrs. Miranda's family.         Mrs. Miranda was born on Aug. 4, 1907, in a Manhattan mansion to Moussa and Laurette Schinasi. Mr. Schinasi, once a poor Turkish immigrant, had become a millionaire through his patented cigarette-rolling machine, which led to the establishment of a company that manufactured ''ready rolled'' cigarettes.         In the mid-1940's Mrs. Miranda sold her eyeglass interests and moved to Los Angeles. She later became a filmmaker, producing a film about George Grosz, the Weimar artist, with whom she had once studied.         In 1981 she relocated to Santa Fe  and continued work as a visual artist until her health began to decline in recent years.         She is survived by her husband, Celestino Miranda; a son, Terry Sanders of Los Angeles, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Doris R. Schwartz, a nurse who did some of the earliest research on geriatric nursing care and whose findings led to improvements in health care for the elderly, died on Sunday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa.         A former resident of Manhattan, Ms. Schwartz was 84 and had moved to the Foulkeways Continuing Care Community in Gwynedd after a stroke in 1980. She retired that year from Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing, where she was a professor for many years.         Ms. Schwartz's familiarity with the debilities of old age stemmed from her years as an Army nurse in World War II, when she tended to wounded soldiers with similar afflictions. Her work continued even after she began to use a wheelchair.         After moving to the retirement center, she initiated research by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing into the use of physical restraints on patients in nursing homes and hospitals; her work led to changes in restraint procedures.         Ms. Schwartz wrote an autobiography, ''My Fifty Years in Nursing: Give Us to Go Blithely'' (Springer; 2d ed., 1995), which remains in print.         In the weeks before her death, she had been working on a book about the 55 people who most influenced her career.         Doris Schwartz was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the Central Methodist Hospital School of Nursing there in 1942. She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps and served in the Pacific and, after the war, at a military rehabilitation center in Battle Creek, Mich., rising to the rank of captain.         She then worked as a public health nurse in the Visiting Nurse Service with babies and new mothers in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn into the 1950's. She became an adviser to the Teaching Nursing Home Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.         She was a member of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Science and co-director of two groundbreaking programs to train geriatric and family nurse practitioners at Cornell University-New York Hospital. There she taught staff members and worked with victims of strokes and dementia.         A Doris Schwartz Chair of Gerontological Nursing was established at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Doris Schwartz Research Award, honoring a nurse for outstanding research in aging, is given by the Hartford Foundation Institute of Geriatric Nursing at New York University.         Ms. Schwartz leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Evelyn Shrifte, the longtime president of Vanguard Press, which published the first books of Saul Bellow, Dr. Seuss and Joyce Carol Oates, died on Aug. 8 at her home on the West Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         Ms. Shrifte, whose name is pronounced ''Shrift,'' was one of the first women to head a book publishing company. She began working for the independent Vanguard full time in the early 1930's and was its president from 1952 until it was sold to Random House in 1988, when it was 62 years old. For many years it was at 424 Madison Ave., near 49th Street, in Manhattan.         In his history of American book publishing, ''Between Covers,'' John Tebbel wrote, ''Vanguard never became a large and important house, but it continued to publish quality books year after year.''         Those books included Mr. Bellow's first two novels, ''Dangling Man'' and ''The Victim''; Dr. Seuss's first two books, ''And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street'' and ''The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,'' and a score of books by Ms. Oates, including the novel ''Them,'' which won the National Book Award. Ms. Shrifte edited books by Ms. Oates, James T. Farrell, Marshall McLuhan and other authors at Vanguard.         After the sale she said: ''Random House will take good care of our books and authors. But I'm trying not to cry while I break the news to our authors.'' She said the sale was prompted by the poor health of some of Vanguard's investors. In its last years Vanguard published fewer than 20 new titles annually, but it had 500 books on its backlist.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Shrifte received a bachelor's degree in 1921 from Barnard. She worked for the Musical Quarterly and opened a bookshop in Manhattan before joining Vanguard. After it was sold, she retired.         She is survived by a sister, Bernice Woll of Larchmont, N.Y., two nephews, two nieces and four grand-nieces.       
         Jennifer Paterson, the over-the-top co-star of the quirky television cooking show ''Two Fat Ladies,'' died yesterday at a hospital in London, where she lived. She was 71.         Lung cancer had been diagnosed last month after Ms. Paterson fell ill while filming installments of the cooking series with her partner, Clarissa Dickson Wright.         The show, featuring the two unashamedly corpulent and opinionated eccentrics, is a hit in Britain and the United States and has been syndicated in other countries following its debut on the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1996.         Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright were unknown to each other until they were brought together by a BBC producer in what was described as a match made in ratings heaven. One fan who apparently contributed to the ratings was Prince Charles, who sent a gift of homemade organic tomato soup and vanilla ice cream to Ms. Paterson after she disclosed her illness last month.         Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright offered their viewers cholesterol-soaked dishes that they favored in their own homes. One show, called ''Meat,'' featured meatloaf draped with strips of bacon, lamb stew, fillet of beef and, perhaps as a nod to health fanatics, a pan-fried chicken dish.         ''I blame Americans for this fear of red meat and fat that's spread all over England,'' Ms. Paterson told an interviewer last year while taking a sip of vodka in a restaurant before heading to the sidewalk for a pre-lunch cigarette.         Ms. Dickson Wright agreed, although she credited the success of the show to a backlash against what she called the health police. ''Our show seems to say to Americans that it's O.K. to eat red meat and cook with butter,'' she said in the same article. ''I don't know why they feel they need permission.''         Each episode of ''The Two Fat Ladies'' was recorded at a different location. Every show began with Ms. Paterson astride a motorcycle with her partner squeezed into a sidecar, zooming toward their destination. When they did their ''Meat'' show, for example, they cooked for a girls' lacrosse team in the kitchen of a boarding school.         They each cooked two dishes per show, working in tandem and punctuating their culinary advice with a raucous sense of humor on any subject that took their fancy. They delighted in skewering the pretensions of haute cuisine.         Last year Ms. Paterson said she was in fine shape for her age. ''Lots of meat, drink and cigarettes and not giving in to things,'' she said in an interview.         She was born into an army family and was unconventional even as a child. At 15 she was expelled from convent school for being disruptive; she later became a matron at a girls' boarding school near Reading.         Ms. Paterson went on from there to become a professional chef. She was the cook for the Ugandan legation in London and later provided weekly lunches for celebrities, including Prince Charles. She was a food columnist for The Spectator when she met Ms. Dickson Wright, a former barrister who wrote a column for Decanter magazine and owned a cookbook store in Edinburgh, where she lives.         The pair was characterized by Suzanne Hamlin in a 1998 article in The New York Times as being ''as appealing as someone else's dotty aunts.'' But Ms. Hamlin, in reviewing their cookbook ''Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies'' (Clarkson Potter),  reported that all six of six recipes she tested did not work as described and that eccentricities and farce failed to be compelling in a cookbook that purported to be useful.         Following its instructions, she said, one dish ended up looking as though ''it had barely survived a brush fire'' and a pudding that was touted as thick and creamy turned out ''wan and thin as a sauce.''         ''It is their rapid rise here, of course, that makes this careless effort at a cookbook so regrettable,'' she wrote.         The Food Network began broadcasting the shows in the United States in 1997 and, as Ms. Hamlin noted, ''in the blink of an eye, they developed a cult following among those who have an innate fondness for British eccentrics.'' American Public Television also distributes ''Two Fat Women'' to stations all over the country.         The Food Network is planning a two-hour tribute to Ms. Paterson, who is survived by an uncle and two brothers, on Sunday night at 9.         Ms. Dickson Wright told the BBC that she had last seen Ms. Paterson 10 days ago, although they had spoken each day on the telephone. She had intended to visit her today to drop off a tin of caviar, she said.         ''She didn't see the point of flowers,'' Ms. Dickson Wright said. ''She'd rather have caviar.''       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         Diane Erickson, a model who was on the cover of Self magazine's first issue in 1979 and who later became a fashion photographer, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She was 43.         She died from complications from breast cancer, said Meg D'Incecco, the public relations director of Self, a health and fitness magazine for women.         Ms. Erickson acted in several films, including ''Jagged Edge'' and ''Runaway Train.'' After her cancer was diagnosed last year, Ms. Erickson wrote a monthly chronicle of her fight against cancer called ''Diane's Diary'' for Self.         She also began to create a visual and literary record of her life and was preparing it as a book with a friend.         Mason Flaine, chairman of C.R.C. Press, a specialized publishing house, said he planned to publish the book when the friend completed it.         Born on May 24, 1956, in the Boston area, Ms. Erickson studied photography at the State University of New York at Buffalo and later worked with well-known fashion photographers.         She was legally separated from her husband, Michael Charles. She is survived by her daughter, Helena, of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Helfer of Centerville, Tex.; two brothers, John Erickson of Cleveland and Thomas Erickson of Houston, and two sisters, Christina Reid of Sugarland, Tex., and Jane Ashmore of Texas.       
         Marion Zimmer Bradley, a science fiction writer and the creator of the Darkover series of fantasies, died on Saturday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 69 and lived in Berkeley.         The cause was a heart attack, said Elisabeth Waters, her cousin and secretary.         Ms. Bradley rose to fame in 1958 with the publication of ''The Planet Savers,'' the first of her top-selling Darkover novels. The series eventually comprised 21 books, written almost exclusively by Ms. Bradley, which told the story of a planet discovered at the end of the 21st century  and colonized by Earth.         She later worked primarily in the fantasy genre, often adding a feminist spin to well-known myths. In 1983, she published her most famous work, ''The Mists of Avalon,'' a retelling of the legend of King Arthur  from the vantage point of its principal women, Viviane, Gwynyfar, Morgaine and Igraine. Hailed by Maureen Quilligan in The New York Times as ''a massive narrative that is rich in events placed in landscapes no less real for often being magical,'' the novel remained on The Times best-seller list for four months. In her 1987 work ''The Firebrand,'' she retold the story of the Trojan War from the perspective of the prophet  Cassandra, whom she renamed Kassandra.         Born in Albany, N.Y., Ms. Bradley began to write as a teen-ager and by the age of 17 had created a magazine for science-fiction fans. Two years later she began writing for pulp magazines. In 1964 she graduated from  Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Tex., and then did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley from 1965 to 1967.         Though she continued to write until her death, Ms. Bradley's poor health in the early 1990's limited her activities. She devoted much of her time to editing magazines, including her own, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called ''Sword and Sorceress'' from Daw Books in New York.         Ms. Bradley's marriage to Robert Alden Bradley ended in divorce in 1964. She is survived by three children, David Bradley of Oakland, Calif.; Patrick Breen of Denver, and Moira Stern of Sparks, Nev.; a brother, Leslie Zimmer of East Greenbush, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer who was considered the queen of fado, died yesterday at her home in Lisbon. She was 79.         Her recording company, Valentim de Carvalho, said she was found dead in her bed by her secretary.         Fado, which means fate in Portuguese, is a passionate, volatile, haunted style that originated in the cafes and taverns of Lisbon. Played on the round, bright-toned 12-string Portuguese guitar, with Arabic elements that make it kin to Spanish flamenco, fado is filled with the quality called saudade in Portuguese: a mixture of sadness and nostalgia, longing and resignation. Its lyrics are bleak and fatalistic, with their suffering described in the first person. Ms. Rodrigues performed in the black clothes of mourning, with her head thrown back and her face like a mask of tragedy, singing in a voice that was at once tearful and fierce.         ''I have so much sadness in me, I am a pessimist, a nihilist, everything fado demands in a singer, I have in me,'' Ms. Rodrigues once said. ''When I am on my own, alone, tragedy comes, and solitude.''         During more than 50 years as a performer, Ms. Rodrigues was acclaimed as the definitive voice of fado, revered in Portugal and acclaimed as its musical representative around the world. When her death was announced, Portugal's radio stations dropped regular programming and began broadcasting tributes. The Prime Minister of Portugal, Antonio Guterres, ordered three days of national mourning. Reuters reported that Mr. Guterres said: ''It is a moment of great sadness. She was the voice of Portugal.''         Amalia Rodrigues was born in 1920 in the Alfama district of Lisbon, the cradle of fado. She was one of 10 children in a working-class family and was reared by her grandmother. She sold fruit in the streets and worked as a seamstress before she began to perform as a tango dancer.         As a teen-ager her renditions of tangos built a reputation, and she began singing professionally in 1939. At first her family did not approve of her singing tango and fado, songs associated with the lower classes and the underworld.         She made her first recordings in 1945 in Portugal and in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952 she signed to the Valentim de Carvalho label and began to reshape the tradition. She combined the urban and rural styles of Lisbon and Coimbra; she chose lyrics that reached beyond stories of heartbreak to muse on God and destiny.         Ms. Rodrigues began to tour beyond Portugal after World War II. She performed regularly in Brazil, Spain, France and Britain and eventually gave concerts in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Soviet Union. She recorded more than 170 albums that were released in 30 countries, and appeared in a dozen films, notably ''Les Amants du  Tage'' (''Lovers of the Tagus''), by the French director Henri Verneuil.         Fado fell from its commercial peak during the 1960's, and after 1974, when a revolution removed the dictator Antonio Salazar, fado was associated by many Portuguese with the authoritarian regime. ''I always sang fado without thinking of politics,'' Ms. Rodrigues said. ''I never had the support of any government.''         By then, Ms. Rodrigues was known around the world. At her concerts, including her last New York City performance at Town Hall in 1990, rapt listeners sang along to her songs of love and death. In the 1990's she had heart surgery and retired from singing because of poor health. She made her last public appearance in 1998 in Lisbon, singing at the opening of Expo 1998.       
         Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and painting in the 1960's and then left the New York art world for self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation Center in Texas.  She was 68 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's cousin.         Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum. They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body, intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of tools.         By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism, making nearly monochromatic ''Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960's she also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life. These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art world that bordered on hostility.         Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art, attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her ''Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and letting them fall where they may. In ''Transistor Radio Piece'' she listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.         In 1969 and 1970 Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the art world in works that she titled ''General Strike Piece'' and ''Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.         Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. A brief marriage in the late 1950's to an architect, Adrian Lozano, ended in divorce. She leaves no survivors.         Ms. Lozano had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries, Mitchell Algus, Rosen & Van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ''Wave'' paintings and notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these exhibitions were men.       
         Dr. Naomi Bluestone, a medical writer, a practitioner, a teacher and a ''Dear Abby'' to a generation of aspiring doctors, died Nov. 13 at her home in Center Barnstead, N.H. She was 63 and had moved there from Great Neck, N.Y., in 1991.         The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said her husband, Robert Press.         Dr. Bluestone wrote about 200 articles in professional as well as lay journals. She wrote a book, ''So You Want to Be a Doctor?'' (William Morrow, 1981), for college students contemplating medical careers and fielded the question with humor and satire.         Her main interests were in social and public health and psychiatry, and she continued to write about them to the end. Until two years ago, her general psychiatric practice in Center Barnstead drew patients from near and far.         Born in Wilmington, Del., she graduated from the University of Delaware with an English major. Changing course, she graduated from Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1962 and trained in psychiatry in New York in the 1980's.         In between, Dr. Bluestone held teaching and administrative posts in New York at Mount Sinai Hospital, Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital and Montefiore Hospital. She was also  the city's assistant commissioner of health for chronic and long-term care in the 1970's.         She wrote on many issues confronting American medicine, particularly those affecting women as doctors and patients. Dr. Bluestone also helped organize national conferences and seminars on the challenges for female doctors and the special problems of female patients.         She wrote columns for such publications as The New Physician, Medical Dimensions and Resident and Staff Physician. As an editor she was associated with The New York State Journal of Medicine and The Journal of Community Health.         ''I was getting letters from medical students,'' Dr. Bluestone said in an interview after her book was published, ''and the medical students would pour their hearts out to me to the point where I was starting to feel like the Dear Abby of the medical profession.''         She said some asked advice about the dictatorial atmosphere of hospitals and the terror and loneliness of internship, adding, ''The women, in particular, wrote to me about sexism, discrimination, problems juggling career, home, family, husband.''       
         Georgia Hofmann, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses, including the Triple Tiara winner Sky Beauty, died Sunday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 91.         The cause was complications from leukemia, which was diagnosed several months ago, said Lawrence G. Foster, a family spokesman.         Mrs. Hofmann learned to ride horses bareback and said that was when her love for them began. In 1962, she bought her first racehorse, a filly named Calabrea, who won her first race and paid $72 to win.         ''That horse was the real reason I am in the racing business today,'' she said years later. She did most of her own buying and selling, and bred or owned such outstanding horses as Gold Beauty, named the champion sprinter in 1982, Louis Quatorze, winner of the 1996 Preakness, Gold Stage, Maplejinsky, Dayjur, Royal Indy and Bankers Gold.         But the pride and prize of the lot was Sky Beauty, a daughter of the European champion Blushing Groom and a granddaughter of Nijinsky II. She came into prominence in 1992, when she won five starts. And, in 1993, she was only the eighth filly to win the Triple Tiara, the equivalent of the Triple Crown for fillies.         Mrs. Hofmann was the widow of Philip B. Hofmann, a retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson, the health care products company. Mr. Hofmann's lifelong interest in horses centered on jumpers, show horses and coach-and-four competitions. He left the thoroughbred racing to his wife, and when at the racetrack he often said: ''I'm just here to watch. She's the expert.''         Mrs. Hofmann's first marriage, to Fred R. Fehlhaber, ended in divorce.         Georgia Hofmann was born Georgia Ellis on a farm near Montgomery, Ala. She became a fashion model in New York and had a minor part in a musical production staged by Florenz Ziegfeld. But she seemed to have a sixth sense about a racehorse's breeding and racing potential. She spent long hours studying books and reports on bloodlines.         Mrs. Hofmann, who owned Wycombe House Stud, a 218-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., earned more than $12 million through the sale of 22 horses, including Sky Beauty.         Although she was ill, Mrs. Hofmann attended the Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park in Florida on Nov. 6. The next day, she flew to Lexington, Ky., to preside over the sale of the last of her racehorses.         She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth St. Almond of Jacksonville, Fla.; two stepdaughters, Judy Hofmann Richter of Bedford, N.Y., and Carol Hofmann Thompson of Colts Neck, N.J.; a stepson, Robert F. Fehlhaber of Fort Lauderdale, Fla; and two stepdaughters, Chris Fehlhaber McGuire of Vero Beach, Fla., and Julie Fehlhaber Flavell of Fort Lauderdale.         Mrs. Hofmann, who never had children, often referred to her horses as ''my babies.''       
         Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the company, died on Sunday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.         Her title for many years was simply general manager, but Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight and was unknown to the balletgoing public. A woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.         Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the City Ballet, described her role in ''Thirty Years,'' his history of the organization, ''at once labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ''proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and impossible.''         Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo, then moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an assistant editor at John Bernard Myers's literary journal View and an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that gained her entry into the world of New York poets, artists and intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940's.         It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart, where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired in 1985. Her first job there was as an assistant to Frances Hawkins, the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who, as chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948, extended a crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City Ballet.         Ms. Cage was an avid practitioner  of tai chi, the Chinese system of movement. She collaborated with her husband, Edward Maisel, on ''Tai Chi for Health,'' published in 1972. Ms. Cage also taught unofficial tai chi classes at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Lucile Petry Leone, the founding director of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, which recruited more than 100,000 young women to study nursing and helped spare the country of the need to draft nurses in World War II, died on Nov. 25 at an assisted-living center in San Francisco. She was 97.         As early as the summer of 1941, months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, there was talk in Washington that it might be necessary to conscript nurses to care for the inevitable high number of casualties there would be should the United States become engaged in a major war.         A less radical alternative -- and a much more politically acceptable one -- was temporarily agreed upon. The United States Public Health Service would start a program to attract young women at schools throughout the country into nursing. Lucile Petry, a teacher at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, was chosen to initiate the program.         Two years later, after the United States was at war in both Europe and Asia, Ms. Leone founded and directed the Cadet Nurse Corps, a more formal effort to start women on a path to nursing. The program, authorized by Congress in 1943, offered to cover the cost of a candidate's tuition, fees, room and board, books, monthly stipends and snappy navy-style uniforms.         In exchange, said Ellen Schell, a nursing historian based in San Francisco, candidates had to ''promise to participate in essential military or civilian nursing for as long as the war lasted.''         The Cadet Nurse Corps proved a success, meeting its recruitment quotas in 1943 and 1944 and outstripping them in the final year of the war, when there were 112,000 cadets in the program. As a consequence, the United States never had to draft nurses into the armed services during the war.         Explaining the success of the Cadet Nurse Corps, Ms. Leone told an interviewer in 1945: ''We had a saleable package from the beginning. The girls immediately liked the idea of being able to combine war service with professional education for the future.''         She also gave credit to the organization's slogan, ''Custodians of the Crises of Life.''         In 1949, Ms. Leone became the first woman to direct a division of the United States Public Health Service, the Division of Nurse Education. Her rank was equivalent to that of an admiral.         ''In that capacity,'' said Zina Mirsky, assistant dean for administration at the School of Nursing of the University of California at San Francisco, ''she established the role of nursing in the federal government -- a presence that still exists.''         Ms. Leone retired from government service in 1966 and went on to teach nursing and serve as associate dean at Texas Women's University.  She retired again in 1971.         Lucile Petry, the only child of a high school principal and his wife, was born on Jan. 23, 1902, in Frog Heaven, in Preble County, Ohio. She was reared in Selbyville, Del., and  after graduating from the University of Delaware in 1924, she received  advanced degrees at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in 1927 and Columbia Teachers College in 1929. She taught at the Yale School of Nursing and the University of Minnesota School of Nursing before being summoned to Washington.         Ms. Leone's marriage to Nicholas Leone ended in divorce in 1967. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Nilde Iotti, an early leader of the Italian Communist Party and the first woman to become president of the lower house of Parliament, died Friday night of heart failure after a long illness, the news agency ANSA reported. She was 79.         Ms. Iotti, who served as a Partisan during World War II, was first elected to office in 1946, winning a seat in the constitutional assembly. At age 26, she took part in the ''Committee of the 75,'' which wrote a first draft of Italy's postwar constitution.         From 1979 until 1992, she served as Italy's president of the lower house of Parliament, a role similar to that of the speaker of the house in the United States. It made her No. 2 in line to succeed the president.         In Parliament, her regal manner earned her the nicknames, ''Czarina'' and ''The Red Queen.'' She described herself differently, saying, ''I'm just a woman who has a difficult job and tries to do it with tact.''         The daughter of a railway worker, Ms. Iotti was born in Reggio Emilia, the heart of Italy's ''red belt'' and studied literature at the Catholic University of Milan. She moved to Rome after the war, where she met and fell in love with Palmiro Togliatti, Italy's Communist Party leader.         Mr. Togliatti was married, and divorce was then illegal in Italy. The couple adopted a daughter in 1950, the sister of a worker killed by police during a strike in Modena. The couple stayed together until Mr. Togliatti's death in 1964.         Viewed throughout her life as a staunch member of the Communist Party's central committee, Ms. Iotti changed along with many in her party after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. She was one of the first party officials to endorse the proposal to rid the party of its hammer and sickle and rename themselves ''Democrats of the Left.''         Ms. Iotti, who campaigned to legalize divorce and abortion in Italy, resigned from Parliament last month, citing ill health.         Her coffin will be laid in state in the Italian Parliament and she will receive a state funeral on Monday. She is survived by her daughter, Marisa Malagoli Togliatti.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''
