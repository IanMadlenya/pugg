         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Kitty Buck, who with her husband, Otto, ran Cake Masters Bakery, an institution on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that made cakes for Liberace, President Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor -- and for less famous families' celebrations -- for more than half a century, died on Jan. 9 in Oceanside, N.Y.         She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         Cake Masters, which the Bucks founded and operated, was known by its slogan, ''where baking is an art.'' At its peak, there were 15 shops, 14 in Manhattan and one in Queens. Many of the stores were clustered within blocks of each other on Broadway, a reflection of a time before supermarkets when people walked to bakeries for their daily loaves.         The chain developed the concept of cake as extravaganza, and sold many creations to theatrical and film productions. When Michael Todd staged a Madison Square Garden celebration in 1957 for the first anniversary of his movie ''Around the World in 80 Days,'' Cake Masters delivered the cake, even as an elephant delivered Mr. Todd's wife, Miss Taylor.         Mrs. Buck was born Gussie Rubin on June 15, 1907, in Hurleyville, N.Y., in the Catskills and attended a one-room school, where the teacher demanded, ''What kind of name is Gussie?'' According to her grandson Michael Halio, the teacher then said, ''I'm going to call you Katherine.''         She immediately shortened her new name to Kitty, and in the 1930's, had it legally changed.         She grew up on a dairy farm near Bridgeville, also in the Catskills, her daughter Barbara Halio said. Her father opened a rooming house for summer tourists, which later became the Capitol Hotel. When the hotel burned down in the late 1920's, the family moved to the Bronx and settled down on Morris Avenue.         She got a job as a sales clerk in a Bronx bakery, where a co-worker introduced her to Otto, a young baker who had recently immigrated from Germany. They married in 1930. In 1937, they borrowed $500 from Kitty's sister, Muriel, for a down payment on the first Cake Masters, at Broadway and 84th Street. Eventually baking operations were centralized at the company's building on West 72nd Street, which opened in 1955, and the other locations were used as stores.         In 1959, Mr. Buck died at 52. Mrs. Buck resolved to carry on. ''This is my husband's sweat and blood,'' she said, according to family lore.         A woman running what was then often a man's business, Mrs. Buck pushed racks around the bakery floor, rode to the stores in the cabs of her trucks and dealt with unions daily. In a photograph of a food industry gathering at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1965, she was the only woman on the dais.         By herself, she more than kept up the bakery's style. In 1961, it was a Cake Masters technician who was sent to Washington to confect a huge cake for President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball. In 1982, a Cake Masters cake towered over the first ''Night of 100 Stars'' at Radio City Music Hall. Often, one of its creations was part of the bridal display at Tiffany & Company.         Mrs. Buck was also admired for her personal style, with some likening her upswept hair, smoky voice and quick wit to those of Lauren Bacall, who bought her children's birthday cakes at Cake Masters.         The stores began to close as rents rose and customers began to bypass butchers and bakers for supermarkets. The last Cake Masters shop, on Third Avenue at 65th Street, closed in 1992. Mrs. Buck, then 85, retired.         In addition to her daughter Barbara, of Oceanside, and her sister, Muriel Merritt, of San Antonio, Mrs. Buck is survived by another daughter, Joan Buck of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Sonia Arova, a Bulgarian-born ballerina who became an international star and was an early partner of such great male dancers as Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev, died on Sunday in San Diego. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Ms. Arova was the ballerina with whom Nureyev danced the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux at his New York debut with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet on March 10, 1962, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She and Bruhn first met in the mid-1940's in the Metropolitan Ballet, a short-lived but artistically enterprising London troupe.         Nureyev, Bruhn, Ms. Arova and the American ballerina Rosella Hightower joined forces to present sensationally successful programs together in Paris in 1962. Later that year, she was again Nureyev's ballerina as guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.         A dancer of strong technique and dramatic projection, Ms. Arova was born Sonia Errio in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where she studied music as well as ballet, receiving her dance training at the school of the Sofia Opera Ballet. When her teachers recommended further study in Paris, she left Bulgaria at age 11 with her mother. Her father sold his stamp collection to pay for her Parisian classes.         With the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Arova's British piano teacher in Paris urged her to escape France. Disguised in male attire as the teacher's son, Ms. Arova was smuggled into England on a fishing boat in 1940. She never saw her father again but was eventually reunited with her mother and sister.         In England, she danced with International Ballet (1942), Ballet Rambert (1946) and, most notably, with Metropolitan Ballet (1947-48). Then she became a balletic globe-trotter.         Ms. Arova was first associated with Page in Paris in 1951 when she danced a leading role in ''Revenge,'' the popular choreographic adaptation of the opera ''Il Trovatore'' that Page created for Les Ballets des Champs Élysées. Later, she appeared with Page's own Chicago company.         She was guest artist with American Ballet Theater several times in the 1950's and 60's, dancing both classical and contemporary works. Reviewing her performance in 1956, John Martin of The New York Times said she had become ''a lovely and curiously individual dancer, especially where dramatic color and characterization are involved.''         She also danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, London Festival Ballet, the Komaki Ballet of Japan, the Australian Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington.         Ms. Arova became increasingly involved with company direction, often in association with Thor Sutowski, the American dancer and choreographer, whom she married in 1965. As director of the Norwegian National Ballet from 1966 to 1970, she introduced several ballets by George Balanchine into the repertory, produced the first complete Oslo versions of ''Swan Lake'' and ''La Sylphide'' and was knighted for her services by King Olaf V.         She became director of the San Diego Ballet in 1971. In 1977 she and Mr. Sutowski were named co-directors of the dance department at the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a state-run high school in Birmingham. Many dancers they trained joined the Birmingham-based Ballet South, which made its New York debut at Brooklyn College in 1996 with a ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski. Anna Kisselgoff of The Times praised it for allowing its young women to ''show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork'' and ''dance with a pure classical style.''         Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski returned to San Diego in 1997, where they taught for both the San Diego Ballet and the California Ballet.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ariane Sutowski of San Diego, and a sister, Jeanette Errio of Vence, France.       
         Inna Zubkovskaya, a leading ballerina in the Kirov Ballet when that Russian company first appeared in the West, died on Feb. 5 in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 77.         The Kirov was at a peak but unfamiliar to ballet audiences throughout the world until 1961. Ms. Zubkovskaya led the troupe in its United States debut when she appeared in the dual role of Odette-Odile in ''Swan Lake'' at the Kirov's opening night on Sept. 11, 1961, at the Metropolitan Opera House.         The company had performed a few months earlier in Paris, where it was rocked by Rudolf Nureyev's defection but continued on to London for its British debut. The depth of dancing at that time proved that the company from St. Petersburg was dependent on no single star but had an array of distinguished ballerinas, a stunning corps and other male dancers of superstar caliber like Yuri Soloviev.         Ms. Zubkovskaya belonged to the heroic generation of Soviet dancers that was responsible for the Kirov's impact in the West and who was deeply admired at home. She was prominent in the London season, where she was praised for her range and the mix of sweep and bravura in her classical style. Writing from London, John Martin of The New York Times called her Odette ''beautifully lyrical, always with a dramatic tone beneath the surface.''         Ms. Zubkovskaya was born Inna Izraelyeva in Moscow, where she graduated in 1941 from the Bolshoi Ballet school. Invited to join the Kirov, she danced with that company until 1970, performing in the classics and the premieres of major Soviet ballets including Leonid Jakobson's version of ''Spartacus'' and Yuri Grigorovich's ''Legend of Love.'' She had continued to work as a teacher and coach until her death.         She was married twice to fellow dancers, first to Nikolai Zubkovsky and then to Sviatoslav Kuznetsov.       
         Maude Russell Rutherford, a singer and dancer in the glory days of black theater in the 1920's who always said she was the one who really introduced the Charleston on Broadway, died on March 8 at her home in Atlantic City. She is believed to have been 104.         Strikingly pretty, she was billed as the Slim Princess when she worked with Josephine Baker, Fats Waller and Pearl Bailey. Never a star, Ms. Rutherford was usually the soubrette or a featured performer and a great favorite at Harlem's Cotton Club.         She wrote her particular footnote to history in 1922 in the Broadway show ''Liza, '' an all-black revue with lyrics and music by Maceo Pinkard.  While many dance histories credit the 1923 show ''Runnin' Wild'' with bringing the Charleston to Broadway, Ms. Rutherford led the ''Liza'' chorus girls in the dance a year earlier.         She remained proud of her dance abilities to the end of her life.         ''I used to kick 32 times across the stage, and my legs would hit my nose,'' Ms. Rutherford told Jean-Claude Baker, who was reared by Josephine Baker and who is a student of black entertainment. ''I was a dancing fool.''         Ms. Rutherford was born in Texas to a black mother, Margaret Lee, and a white father, William McCann. With interracial unions prohibited, her parents never lived together.         As a teenager working as a ticket taker, Ms. Rutherford met Sam Russell, a star of the black theater with the comedy team Bilo and Ashes. He asked her to go on the road with him. She demanded marriage first. The marriage was violent and short. Ms. Rutherford, weary of being beaten, surreptitiously relieved her husband of $100, then struck out on her own.         Tall, with a sweet voice, she would play the bouncy, good-time girl, perhaps the comic relief. ''I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles'' was a youthful audition choice. Early in her career a producer tried to mold her as a blues singer, but, as Ms. Rutherford told Mr. Baker in a taped interview, it did not fit. The producer said, ''Honey, you stick to bubbles.''         Her style offstage was down to earth and no-nonsense, and she used language too vivid to be called plain-spoken; she described one colleague as ''so ugly she could take a stick and break day.''         Ms. Rutherford's theater credits included ''Dixie to Broadway'' (1924), ''Chocolate Scandals'' (1927) and ''Keep Shufflin' '' (1928). She left show business in the 1950's and in 1953 married her fifth husband, Septimus Rutherford, chief steward for the Moore-McCormack Lines. She worked as a switchboard operator in an Atlantic City hotel.         But she never lost her show-biz flair.         When her husband died in 1980, Ms. Rutherford had her name carved into the headstone she and her husband would share, as well as a birth date, Mr. Baker said.         But instead of 1897, which she had told friends was the year of her birth, the carved date was 1902.         ''She said, 'By the time I die, nobody will be here to remember, so I will go forever in eternity five years younger,' '' Mr. Baker said.       
         Birgit Akesson, a dancer and choreographer whose unconventional approach to movement and music made her a prominent pioneer of Swedish modern dance, died on Saturday in Stockholm, where she lived. She died on her 93rd birthday.         Unlike most modern dancers in the United States and Europe in the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Akesson was less concerned with expressing emotion than with finding the essence of dance through form. She rebelled early against her Expressionist training and became known for pure and rigorous solos, often performed without music.         Although she stopped dancing in 1965, Ms. Akesson's role as a founding mother of Swedish modern dance was increasingly recognized in the last 30 years, and she was awarded the gold medal of the Swedish Academy in 1998. Her works were seen on Swedish television, and her pure-dance aesthetic found favor with a new generation of viewers. A founder of the Choreographic Institute in Stockholm, she was an expert on dance in Asia and also Africa, where she sought the roots of a dance culture absent in the West.         In the 1950's she choreographed several works for the Royal Swedish Ballet as well as a space age opera, ''Aniara,'' that was typical of her collaboration with Sweden's modernist composers and poets. Yet her signature style was not dramatic and narrative. Ahead of her time, she sometimes baffled the international dance world with experiments in stillness, a dissociation between music and movement and her uncanny ability to reshape the body into an assemblage of independent planes.         In Paris, where she had made her debut in 1934, this reconfiguring of the body reminded critics of Cubist forms, and Ms. Akesson was called ''the Picasso of Dance.'' American audiences saw her perform in New York (1949 and 1955), and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (1955) and the American Dance Festival (1956). Referring to the slow pace or static quality of some of her solos, the American critic George Beiswanger wrote that she would occasionally ''crawl and writhe like a slug or an upended caterpillar, hardly moving at all.'' But he added, ''If one lets the movement have its way, it generates a compelling, almost hypnotic beauty.''         Ms. Akesson was born in Malmo, Sweden. From 1929 to 1931, she studied in Dresden at the school of Mary Wigman, the German modern dance pioneer. Although she and Birgit Cullberg, who was considered the other founding mother of Swedish modern dance, had their roots in German Expressionist dance, Ms. Akesson did not share Ms. Cullberg's interest in ballet or dance-drama.         In search of her own dance idiom and what she called a first or primary movement that did not depend on music, she moved to Paris, where she presented a solo concert in 1934. Two years later she opened a school in Stockholm, where she concentrated on developing an idiom that would allow each part of the body to move independently.         ''All parts of her dancing body were granted equal importance,'' Horace Engdahl wrote in ''Swedish Ballet and Dance'' (Swedish Institute, 1992). ''This was coupled with a new idea of space as growing out of the movement instead of being a fixed theatrical frame.'' He added that the body ''seemed to be taken apart and reassembled in forever new shapes, dissolving into a continuous flow of images growing one out of the other.''         Molding herself into a sculptural shape with her head or shoulder sometimes resting on the floor, Ms. Akesson often danced with eyes closed. In 1946 she returned to performing with two solos that were considered an artistic breakthrough, ''Blue Evening'' and ''Movement.''         Ms. Akesson began to collaborate with the poet Erik Lindegren and the composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl in works like ''Eye: Sleep in Dream'' (1953). Mr. Lindegren's poem was heard before Ms. Akesson moved in silence, with the music played during blackouts between the danced passages.         Ms. Akesson often turned to the same collaborators for the seven large works, beginning with the 1957 ''Sisyphus,'' that she choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet.         In 1983 she published her highly acclaimed book on African culture, ''The Mask of Spring Water,'' and suddenly returned to choreography in 1989 by creating two solos on television. Long interested in Asian dance, she chose the Chinese-born dancer Chiang Ching to perform both dances, ''Autumn Leaves'' and ''Shades.''         Ms. Akesson is survived by a daughter, Mona Moeller-Nilesen, and a grandchild.       
         Portia Nelson, a cabaret singer, songwriter, actress and author who was one of the most beloved New York nightclub performers of the 1950's, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         Ms. Nelson became a cabaret legend in the 1950's with her appearances in clubs like Café Society, the Blue Angel and the Bon Soir. She also appeared in five feature films, her  most famous role being Sister Berthe in ''The Sound of Music.'' She was in the original cast of the 1954 musical ''The Golden Apple'' and many years later had a long-running role as Mrs. Gurney, a nanny, on the television soap opera, ''All My Children.'' She also found the time to work as vocal coach for stars like Jane Russell and Rock Hudson.         In the 1950's she recorded three albums that were to become classics of their kind, ''Let Me Love You,'' ''Portia Nelson Sings Bart Howard'' and ''Love Songs for a Late Evening,'' all of which have recently  been re-released on DRG Records. As a singer she injected even the most wistful song with an indefatigable verve and optimism. She blended the cultivation of a Broadway soprano with a more intimate cabaret style defined by Mabel Mercer.         She was the first to record a standard by Mr. Howard, ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' when it still went under the title ''In Other Words.'' During the same period she was a protégée of the CBS Records executive Goddard Lieberson, who featured her on five Columbia albums that revived Broadway shows with their original orchestrations.         Ms. Nelson was a prolific songwriter whose most famous composition, ''Make a Rainbow,'' was sung by Marilyn Horne at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inaugural ceremony. The song was originally written for a 1969 NBC special, ''Debbie Reynolds and the Sound of Children'' and dedicated to Ms. Horne at the birth of her daughter. The many other singers who have performed or recorded her songs include Tony Bennett, Michael Feinstein, Dianne Reeves and Barbara Cook.         Born in Brigham City, Utah, her name was originally Betty Mae Nelson. She was called Portia by friends in grade school, who took the name from the radio soap opera ''Portia Faces Life.'' The youngest of nine children (four of whom died before she was born), she grew up in humble circumstances.         At the age of 23, she was discovered singing in a Sherman Oaks, Calif., nightclub by CBS Records. A year later she made her cabaret debut at the Blue Angel.         Her most recent album, ''This Life,'' was released in 1996 by DRG Records. She also published a book, ''There's a Hole in My Sidewalk: The Romance of Self-Discovery,'' which includes a poem, ''Autobiography in Five Short Chapters,'' that is used by many 12-step groups (although Ms. Nelson, who was brought up as a  Mormon, never drank or smoked).         She is survived by a brother, Bernell Nelson of Medford, Ore.       
         Beatrice Straight, a graceful and versatile actress who won both an Oscar and a Tony Award, died on Saturday in North Ridge, Calif. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif., for most of the last 10 years.         Because she came from a wealthy  family, the Whitneys (her mother was Dorothy Payne Whitney), she never had to act for a living but was dedicated to the art of theater. When she became successful, she continued to choose roles for their challenges rather than for their ability to further her career.         Onstage and in films, Ms. Straight projected an image that was dignified but with strong emotional undercurrents. She brought believability to whatever role she undertook, acting in classics as well as contemporary plays and movies.         In the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ''Crucible'' in 1953, she was the essence of Elizabeth Proctor. Reviewing the play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that both Ms. Straight and her co-star, Arthur Kennedy, were superb, adding that in performance, she was ''reserved, detached, above and beyond the contention.'' That role earned her a Tony as best supporting actress.         In 1977 she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her performance in Sidney Lumet's ''Network'' as the wife William Holden's character spurns. The role was brief but noticeable, behind the dramatic fireworks, a familiar place for Ms. Straight.         She had a variety of roles in plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen and Tennessee Williams. In 1982 she scored another film success in ''Poltergeist'' as a psychologist moonlighting as a parapsychologist.         Beatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, N.Y. Her father, Willard Dickerman Straight, was a banker and former official in the State Department. She attended the Lincoln School in New York and Dartington Hall Community in Devonshire, England, a school founded by her mother and stepfather, Leonard Elmhirst.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in ''Bitter Oleander.'' After she persuaded Michael Chekhov, Chekhov's nephew, to join her in forming an acting school and company, the Dartington Hall Players in England, they brought the troupe to the United States, where she performed in Shakespeare. Then she continued on Broadway as Olivia in ''Twelfth Night,'' Emily Dickinson in ''Eastward in Eden'' and Lady Macduff in ''Macbeth,'' with Michael Redgrave.         In 1948 she succeeded Wendy Hiller as Catherine Sloper in the Broadway production of ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square'' in which she played opposite Peter Cookson. After the run, she and Mr. Cookson married. It was a second marriage for both.         In 1950 Ms. Straight played the governess in ''The Innocents,'' an adaptation of James's ''Turn of the Screw'' produced by Mr. Cookson. In his Times review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Straight acted ''with force, sensitivity and old-fashioned charm, in a style that Henry James would have been compelled to applaud.''         She continued to act on and off Broadway, playing opposite Richard Kiley in Robert Ardrey's ''Sing Me No Lullabies'' and opposite Van Heflin in the Broadway version of Rod Serling's television play ''Patterns.'' She also had the title role in Racine's ''Phèdre.''         In 1967 she was in ''Everything in the Garden,'' Edward Albee's adaptation of a play by Giles Cooper. In 1973 she played Mrs. Alving in a Roundabout Theater production of Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and in 1979 was Gertrude to William Hurt's Hamlet at the Circle Repertory Company.         Among her many television appearances, she was Goneril to Orson Welles's King Lear in an abbreviated version of the play on ''Omnibus,'' and Rose Kennedy in ''Robert Kennedy and His Times.'' In 1986 she was in Mr. Lumet's film ''Power'' and in 1991 played Goldie Hawn's mother in ''Deceived.''         Throughout her life, Ms. Straight was also a producer and teacher. As a founder of Theater Incorporated, she was instrumental in bringing the Old Vic, with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, to the United States. In 1981 she helped revive Michael Chekhov's School of Theater in New York.         Ms. Straight's husband died in 1990. She is survived by her sons, Gary Cookson, an actor in New York, and Tony Cookson, a writer and director in Santa Monica, Calif.; two stepchildren, Peter Cookson Jr. of Irvington, N.Y., and Jane Coopland of Hawaii; a brother, Michael Straight of Chicago, a former deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Despite her patrician background, Ms. Straight always regarded herself as a working actress. ''I may have been born in society,'' she once said, ''but I was never part of anything but theater.''       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died yesterday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening gowns and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, including Steve Allen, Bennett Cerf and Dorothy Kilgallen. The panelists played a form of 20 Questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The show ran from 1950 until 1975.  Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR from 1960 until 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among the others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control. Oh no, that might ruffle his feathers, Ms. Francis replied. ''I used to call her jokingly America's sweetheart, because she didn't want to offend anybody,'' Ms. Bach said.         Her interview style was breezy. ''She was a very good actress, and convinced the interviewee that she really cared,'' Ms. Bach said.         Soon after the radio program was canceled, Ms. Francis began showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Bach said. She left New York six years ago and went to live in a retirement home in San Francisco to be closer to her son.         Ms. Francis also was a pioneer of morning television, appearing as the host of NBC's ''Home'' newsmagazine in the 1950's.         She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One Two Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, but television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''         But she said she had no regrets.         ''I got so much pleasure out of 'What's My Line?'. There were no rehearsals. You'd just sit there and be yourself and do the best you could,'' she said.         Ms. Francis was born Arlene Francis Kazanjian on Oct. 20, 1907, in Boston, the daughter of an Armenian immigrant. After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married the actor Martin Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter Gabel.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died on Thursday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening dresses and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, who played a form of 20 questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The actress, along with Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf, appeared on the show for 15 years, with John Daly as the genial moderator. Steve Allen and Fred Allen also were panelists for a brief period in the 1950's. After the original ''What's My Line?'' ended its run in 1967, the show was revived as a syndicated series the next year. Ms. Francis was the new show's only panelist from the old one, and it had a new host, Walter Bruner.         Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR in New York from 1960 to 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.

She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One, Two, Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, where her Broadway credits included ''All That Glitters'' (1938), ''The Walking Gentleman'' (1942), ''The Overtons'' (1945) and ''The Little Blue Light'' (1951), in which she appeared with Melvyn Douglas, Burgess Meredith and her husband, Martin Gabel.         But television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it, and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''

         Carmen Bucher Wirth, the owner of the Hassler Hotel in Rome, died on June 27 in a Rome hospital. She was 88.         Mrs. Wirth was known for building the Hassler Hotel's image as a home for visiting travelers, introducing a personal management style in which every member of the staff was required to know the hotel guests by name. As part of her daily routine, she stood in the main lobby greeting people by name.         But despite her friendliness with guests, she would not bend the hotel's standards for them. According her son Peter, she did not allow Mike Tyson into the rooftop restaurant because he refused to put on a tie.         When Mrs. Wirth's husband, Oscar Wirth, died in 1968, she assumed the role of the chairwoman of the Hassler Hotel Company.         In the early 1970's, she oversaw a the renovation of the Hassler, adding a garden bar to the hotel. In 1973, as a way of promoting the hotel abroad, Mrs. Wirth started bringing Hassler chefs to Japan and the United States.         In 1985, Mrs. Wirth turned over the administration of the Hassler, which remains one of the leading city hotels still owned and run by a single family, to her son Roberto.         The Hassler's history reaches back to Albert Hassler, who started the business when he bought a small boarding house in Naples, which was named the Hassler Hotel by 1870. The Wirths joined the business in 1915, when Oscar Wirth started to run the Hassler and the Eden hotels. When the two families went their separate ways in 1968, the Wirths kept the Hassler.         Mrs. Wirth was born on March 19, 1913, in New York, where she grew up. She received a degree in international law from the University of Geneva.         In addition to her sons, Mrs. Wirth is survived by her twin sister, Mercedes Bowman of Rome; a brother, Robert Bucher of Geneva; and five grandchildren.       
         Katharine Graham, who transformed The Washington Post from a mediocre newspaper into an American institution and, in the process, transformed herself from a shy widow into a publishing legend, died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a fall on a sidewalk on Saturday in Idaho. She was 84.         Mrs. Graham had been attending a business conference in Sun Valley. She was flown to a hospital in Boise, where she underwent brain surgery but never recovered consciousness, her son Donald E. Graham said.         Mrs. Graham was one of the most powerful figures in American journalism and, for the last decades of her life, at the pinnacle of Washington's political and social establishments, a position this insecure wife and mother never imagined she would, or could, occupy.         It was only after she succeeded her father and her husband as president and later publisher of The Washington Post, a newspaper with a modest circulation and more modest reputation, that it moved into the front rank of American newspapers, reaching new heights when its unrelenting reporting of the Watergate scandal contributed to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.         Mrs. Graham's courage in supporting her reporters and editors through the long investigation was critical to its success. Three years before Watergate, she gave solid backing to The New York Times in a historic confrontation with the government when she permitted her editors to join in publishing the secret revelations about the war in Vietnam known as the Pentagon Papers.         Mrs. Graham would have been the first to say the single greatest decision of her professional career was not in publishing the Pentagon Papers nor in exposing the Watergate scandal but in hiring Benjamin C. Bradlee to be her editor. With her support he forged a staff of reporters and editors that made The Washington Post a force in the capital and in the world of journalism.         Mrs. Graham capped her career when she was 80 years old in 1998 by winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography for her often painful reminiscence, ''Personal History'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Nora Ephron, in her review of the best-selling memoir in The New York Times Book Review, wrote of Mrs. Graham, ''The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.''         Mrs. Graham was a socialite mother of four when her husband, Philip L. Graham, committed suicide in 1963. Her father had given Mr. Graham control of The Post and when the latter died, his widow found herself in a mysterious thicket of corporate politics dominated by men unaccustomed to a woman in the boardroom and highly skeptical of her ability to run a newspaper.         Mrs. Graham saw herself at best as only as an interim caretaker who would try to hold on to The Post for her children. She became something quite different -- the effective steward of a multimillion-dollar communications empire.         ''It's sort of like a fairy tale,'' Mrs. Graham said on being told of her Pulitzer Prize. But her life was its own sort of fairy tale.         She was born in New York City on June 16, 1917. Her father, Eugene Meyer, made his fortune on Wall Street, became a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, went on to organize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and was appointed the first president of the World Bank. Her mother, the former Agnes Ernst, was a tall, self-absorbed woman of intellectual and artistic ambition. She was scathingly critical and often harsh with her daughter, the fourth of five children.         The children were brought up in the traditions of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, the church of presidents, where the Meyers -- Mr. Meyer was Jewish, his wife Lutheran -- had their own pew. Mrs. Graham remembered a lonely childhood in palatial houses in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and in Washington. Her father was often away working, her mother traveling and writing  letters home about her social conquests.         In the absence of maternal warmth and support, Katharine became attached to her governess. Later, she went to the Madeira School for Girls in Virginia. She spent two years at Vassar before transferring to the University of Chicago. Neither of her parents attended her graduation in 1938.         When Katharine was 16, no one thought to tell her that her father had bid $825,000 at public auction to buy the bankrupt Washington Post, a paper with a circulation of 50,000 that was losing a million dollars a year, the fifth newspaper in a five-newspaper town. Later, with yearnings of her own to get into journalism, she took a job at The San Francisco News before going to The Post to work on the editorial page and handle letters to the editor. ''If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of her,'' her father said.         'The Tail to His Kite'         Washington, in 1939, was full of young people converging on the capital to work for The New Deal. Among them was Philip L. Graham of Florida, a brilliant lawyer and a clerk at the Supreme Court, first for Justice Stanley Reed and then for Felix Frankfurter. Shy and insecure, Katharine Meyer could not believe her luck when he asked her to marry him. The heiress agreed to his terms -- that they return to Florida and his father's dairy business, provided, she remembered, that ''I could live with only two dresses because I had to understand that he would never take anything from my father or be involved with him and we would live on what he made.''         It did not work out that way, and Mr. Graham soon accepted his father-in-law's invitation to join The Post. He became associate publisher at 30 and publisher at 31. Mr. Meyer also arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his daughter because, he explained to her, ''no man should be in the position of working for his wife.'' Mrs. Graham did not object because she knew how important it was to her father to keep The Post in the family, and, she wrote, ''in those days, of course, the only possible heir would have been a male.''         Mrs. Graham was belittled and silenced by a husband she adored, the man she called ''the fizz'' in her life. When he drank too much, gave vent to his rage or frequently became ill, she attributed it to the pressure of his work and not to a serious emotional affliction that had not yet been identified.         ''Our relationship resembled that of a chief executive officer Phil and a chief operating officer me,'' Mrs. Graham wrote in her memoir. In addition to handling all domestic matters, she paid all their living expenses from her own trust fund so her husband could pay back the debt he incurred buying even more Post stock.         Mr. Graham was immersed in building up The Washington Post, conducting negotiations to buy the rival Times-Herald and merging it with his paper, and waging political battles as The Post took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his brand of anti-communism. Later Mr. Graham became an even more influential figure in Washington, a close friend of President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.         ''I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,'' Mrs. Graham wrote.         Mr. Graham had his first breakdown in 1957. His recovery was slow, but he eventually re-emerged into Washington life. In 1961, at the urging of Mr. Bradlee, then a young reporter at Newsweek, he negotiated the purchase of the weekly newsmagazine. He also added television stations to the company's holdings.         What his wife later described as his ''hyperactivity, rage and irrationality'' grew. Mrs. Graham was shattered when she discovered that her husband was having an affair with a Newsweek employee. But there was an added blow: she discovered he had a scheme to pay her off and take ownership of The Post, in which he already had controlling interest because her father had given him the majority of Class A shares.         But she decided to fight back. She resolved not to give her husband a divorce unless he gave up enough controlling stock in the Post to give her majority interest.         Mr. Graham became increasingly ill and was in and out of a mental hospital. Finally, his illness had a name, manic depression. The kinds of drugs that were later developed for his condition were not available then, and Mr. Graham, on the advice of his psychiatrist, refused such drugs that were in use. In August 1963, while on a weekend leave from the hospital, Philip Graham, then 48 years old, took one of his hunting rifles and shot himself to death at their farm in Virginia.         Holding On to The Post         As she mourned, the 46-year-old widow sought ways to hold on to The Post until her sons were old enough to run it. (Her daughter was not a candidate in her plan.) Mrs. Graham wrote that she was startled when her friend Luvie Pearson, the wife of the columnist Drew Pearson, told her to run the paper herself. ''Don't be silly, dear. You can do it,'' Mrs. Pearson told her. ''You've got all those genes. . . . You've just been pushed down so far you don't recognize what you can do.''         Mrs. Graham met with the directors of The Post a month after her husband's death and told them that the paper would not be sold and that it would remain in the family. She was elected president of the company, but she felt ''abysmally ignorant'' about how to proceed.         She said she was embarrassed to talk to her own reporters, timid in dealing with the paper's executives and uncomfortable with balance sheets. Both at The Post and in the wider journalistic community, Mrs. Graham was usually the only woman at meetings and dinners. The men hardly knew what to make of her.         Although she had absorbed a great deal over the years from both her father and her husband, she did not feel up to the job as she tried to learn from the top. With the advice and support of friends like the columnists Walter Lippmann and James Reston, she began to feel some level of comfort at The Post, but she still felt shaky at Newsweek, where she went through a series of hirings and firings that some staff members recall as creating havoc at the magazine.         Two years after taking over The Post, she hired Mr. Bradlee, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, to be deputy managing editor and then quickly moved him up to executive editor. They made a formidable team, propelling The Post into one of its most dynamic periods. With Mrs. Graham's backing, Mr. Bradlee forged a staff of reporters and editors and put out a breezy, gutsy paper that investigated government with gusto. A saucy, impertinent Style section appeared that would soon be imitated by competitors but never matched.         Mr. Bradlee's brassy style galvanized his staff and invigorated his publisher.         'The Most Powerful Woman'         As Mrs. Graham struggled to take hold at The Post, she slowly started putting her personal life together. Truman Capote gave what could only be called a coming-out party for her, the Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York, which was not only  the social event of the 1966 season, but also a masked ball of such glamour that it is considered one of the legendary parties of the 20th century.         She wrote, ''For one magic night I was transformed.''         Mrs. Graham's memoir quoted Gerald Clarke, one of Mr. Capote's biographers, as saying: ''She was arguably the most powerful woman in the country, but still largely unknown outside Washington. Putting her in the spotlight was also his ultimate act as Pygmalion. It would symbolize her emergence from her dead husband's shadow; she would become her own woman before the entire world.''         In 1969, and still with considerable trepidation, Mrs. Graham added the title of publisher to her position as president of the Washington Post Company.         In June 1971, The New York Times started publishing the secret history of decision-making during the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. After a few days, a federal judge put The Times under a temporary restraining order, the first time in American history that such an order of prior restraint had been imposed.         The editors and reporters at The Post scrambled to get their own copy of the Pentagon Papers. There was a crisis atmosphere, for at the same time the Washington Post Company was in the process of being taken public, raising concerns that the company could face harsh retribution from federal regulators if it published the Pentagon Papers while The New York Times was enjoined. When The Post obtained its own copy, it was left to Mrs. Graham, as publisher, to decide whether to risk publication.         The editors and reporters urged her to publish the papers, but the lawyers suggested waiting, fearing the whole company -- its newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations -- was at stake. Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go. Let's publish.' ''         At the Supreme Court, the Times and Post cases were heard together, and the justices voted, 6 to 3, on June 30, 1971, against restraining publication of the Pentagon Papers on the ground of endangering national security. That vote is considered a major triumph for freedom of the press.         Mr. Bradlee called the publication of the Pentagon Papers a key moment in the life of the newspaper. ''It was just sort of the graduation of The Post into the highest ranks,'' he said. ''One of our unspoken goals was to get the world to refer to The Post and New York Times in the same breath, which they previously hadn't done. After the Pentagon Papers, they did.''         In a statement yesterday, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, said:         ''We are deeply saddened by the passing of Katharine Graham, a close friend and honored colleague. She will be remembered as a truly remarkable woman, who had a profound effect on the course of events, both at home and abroad. Throughout the last half of the 20th century, she used her intelligence, her courage and her wit to transform the landscape of American journalism, and everyone who cares about a free and impartial press will greatly miss her. We certainly will.''         Weathering Watergate         On June 17, 1972, five months before Nixon's re-election, five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex. The Post began an intense investigation that eventually connected the break-in to the White House.         In the face of intimidation by the Nixon administration, The Post relentlessly published front-page articles by two little-known reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and complemented them with editorials and Herblock cartoons. It eventually proved that what the Nixon administration characterized as a ''third-rate burglary'' was, instead, a scheme directed from the White House to illegally gather intelligence on the Democratic Party, discredit opponents of the administration and subvert the democratic political process.         The Post was alone on reporting Watergate for so long that Mrs. Graham was constantly asking herself, ''If this is such a hell of a story, then where is everybody else?''         In the course of the paper's investigation, the licenses of two of the company's television stations were challenged. Mrs. Graham was advised never to be alone and was also threatened with unspecified retaliation if The Post published an article that said John Mitchell, when he was attorney general, controlled a secret fund that was used to spy on the Democrats. Mr. Mitchell memorably  warned Mr. Bernstein that ''Katie Graham'' would have a breast ''caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.'' Bob Woodward later presented Mrs. Graham with an old-fashioned wooden laundry wringer, which she kept in her office ever after.         At the beginning of the next year the Watergate burglars pleaded guilty, and one of them, hoping to get a more lenient sentence, wrote to John J. Sirica, a federal district judge, to inform him that perjury had been committed and that higher-ups were behind the break-in. That letter vindicated the time and space The Post had devoted to the scandal. For its Watergate reporting, the newspaper was awarded the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.         Meanwhile, the Senate began investigating the scandal and a special prosecutor was appointed. In April 1973, Nixon accepted some responsibility. But in July, it was disclosed that a taping system in the Oval Office had recorded his every word. The tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover-up. He resigned in August 1974.         Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Without the tapes, the true story would never have emerged. In fact, I believe that we at The Post were really saved in the end by the tapes and the lucky chance that they weren't destroyed.''         Meeting the Elite         In time, as Mrs. Graham became more comfortable with her ability to exercise power, she took trips to confer with foreign leaders, usually accompanied by one of the reporters and her friend Meg Greenfield, who was editor of the editorial page of The Post and a columnist for Newsweek. Mrs. Graham liked to tell the story of her visit to a village in the Ivory Coast where the chief exclaimed what an honor it was to have with them the 17th most important person in the world, a description that she said he had apparently picked up from a poll that had appeared in U.S. News & World Report.         In Washington she started to entertain the political elite at her home in Georgetown and an invitation from her came to be seen as second only to an invitation to the White House.         President Bush recalled in a statement yesterday how Mrs. Graham had welcomed him and his wife, Laura, to Washington with a dinner at her home, as she had with other presidents. He called her ''a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others.''         The ''A'' list of the world attended her parties. By the time of her 70th birthday, she had become so powerful a figure that Art Buchwald said in his toast at her party, ''There is one word that brings us all together here tonight. And that word is 'fear.' ''         With the help of the women's movement, and particularly through discussions with Gloria Steinem, Mrs. Graham said she became more cognizant of the causes of her own insecurities and more aware of the problems of working women. She played a signal role in changing Washington mores when it became widely known that on one evening after dinner, she had refused to join the ladies upstairs while the men discussed world affairs over brandy and cigars. And  more women were added to the staffs of both The Post and Newsweek, partly because Mrs. Graham came to understand it was necessary, partly as a result of lawsuits, and partly because of a new climate throughout the country.         Over the years, she found a little time for a personal life. She was courted by a number of men, among them Adlai E. Stevenson after his failed runs for the presidency. She enjoyed weekends at her homes in Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, often in the company of her grandchildren.         Besides her son Donald, she is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Weymouth, known as Lally; her sons William and Stephen; a sister, Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         The funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday at the National Cathedral in Washington.         The Business of News         Mrs. Graham's resolve on editorial questions often contrasted with indecisiveness on business matters. In the 1970's, she acknowledged in her book, she hired and dismissed top executives at Newsweek, the newspaper division and the Washington Post Company too frequently.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Graham and her associates tried to make the Washington Post Company more profitable. Newsweek took the lead among news magazines in increasing subscription and newsstand prices. But holding down costs at The Washington Post led to a bitter confrontation with the mechanical unions.         The clash came in October 1975, when the newspaper's pressmen went on strike after contract talks broke down. As the pressmen, members of Local 6 of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, began their walkout, all 72 of the newspaper's presses were vandalized.         Although the paper failed to publish on the first day, a truncated issue appeared the next day. In the face of threats from the striking workers and occasional physical attacks, the reporters voted to stay on the job. Executives handled the classified advertising department, the mailroom and even the presses when they were repaired. Helicopters landed on the roof of The Post building to ferry copy to presses in Maryland and Virginia. It took nearly a month to repair the presses, but The Post continued to appear.         Mrs. Graham not only went on to win the battle of automation of her newspaper, but also to have the final word on a competitor, the financially troubled Washington Star.  The Post had 75 percent of the city's advertising linage by 1981, and The Star was forced to close. By the end of 1981, The Post's daily circulation had soared to 984,000 from 771,000.         Donald Graham succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979 and chief executive of the company in 1991, a company which by then was valued at nearly $2 billion. Mrs. Graham stepped down as chairwoman of the board in 1993, again to be succeeded by her son, but remained on the board as chairwoman of the executive committee.         Mrs. Graham served on the board of The Associated Press, and was chairwoman and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. and a trustee of George Washington University, the University of Chicago and the Urban Institute.         Finally, she seemed comfortable with herself. ''Worry, if not gone altogether, no longer haunts you in the middle of the night,'' she wrote. ''And you are free -- or freer -- to turn down the things that bore you and spend time on matters and with people you enjoy.''         And she did, till the end. Just two weeks ago she was surrounded by friends at the annual party her daughter gave for her in Southampton, N.Y., and last week was in Idaho for a conference of media executives where she saw more friends and colleagues. She was on her way to a bridge game when she fell.         Katharine Graham's life ended the way she said she wanted it to: ''The only thing I think any of us want,'' she once said, ''is to last as long as we're any good. And then not.''       
         Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ''Ding Dong School'' in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93.         Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ''How are you today?'' She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style.         Then, ''Miss Frances'' would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons:         ''Ask your mother where to play with it,'' for a homemade musical instrument.         ''Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,'' for a messier project.         The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material.         ''Ding Dong School'' began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959.         ''Ding Dong School,'' directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian.         Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ''actually taught kids things,'' Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ''high-tech, dazzly stuff'' of today, ''it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,'' he said.         ''The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,'' he said. ''The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching.''         Its daily competitors at the time were ''Captain Kangaroo'' on CBS and ''Mickey Mouse Theater'' on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ''Ding Dong School'' appeared: ''Sesame Street'' and ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''         In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953.         ''She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,'' The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ''She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers.''         When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ''heartbreaking.''         ''The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,'' he wrote.         In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be.         ''I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,'' she said in a 1955 interview. ''It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,'' she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown.         She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it.         What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ''new doors and windows'' of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said.         Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942.         In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children.         For more than two decades before first ringing the ''Ding Dong'' bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago.         But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II.         ''Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,'' she said.       
         Gina Cigna, a dramatic soprano whose career flourished in the 1930's and 40's, and who was the first to record the title role of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' died on June 26 in Milan. She was 101.         Ms. Cigna, whose given name was Geneviève, was born in Paris in 1900, the daughter of a French general of Italian descent. She began her musical studies as a pianist at the Paris Conservatory. She studied with Alfred Cortot and began what has been described as a promising career as a recitalist. But soon after her marriage in 1923 to Maurice Sens, a tenor at the Comic Opera, she decided to cultivate her voice, with her husband's encouragement.         Her teachers included Lucette Korsoff and Emma Calvé in Paris, and Hariclea Darclée, Rosina Storchio and Giannina Russ in Italy. When she auditioned for Toscanini at La Scala in 1926, he recognized in her both the interpretive fire and the rich timbre necessary for the big Verdi roles, which he advised her to learn. Yet when she made her La Scala debut in 1927 under the name Genoveffa Sens, it was as Freia in Wagner's ''Rheingold.''         That first performance made little impression, and she spent the next two years performing mostly Italian roles in Trieste, Capri, Nice, Verona, Florence and Pavia. When she returned to La Scala in 1929, under the name Gina Cigna, she had a great success as Donna Elvira in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and a few weeks later as Elisabeth in Wagner's ''Tannhäuser.'' She then became a mainstay of the La Scala roster for a decade.         She made her debut in 1933 at Covent Garden as Marguerite in the first British stage production of Berlioz's ''Damnation of Faust,'' and in 1937 she made her American debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the title role of Verdi's ''Aida.'' Olin Downes, reviewing the performance in The New York Times, wrote that ''she interpreted the Aida part with a complete grasp of its dramatic and lyrical elements, prevailingly with beauty and color of tone, with ample sonority and with the style of a musician.''         Ms. Cigna's other roles at the Met included Donna Elvira, Leonora in Verdi's ''Trovatore,'' the title roles in Bellini's ''Norma'' and Ponchielli's ''Gioconda'' and Santuzza in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana.''         Her repertory ranged widely and included Baroque works, most notably Monteverdi's ''Incoronazione di Poppea,'' as well as modern scores like Janacek's ''Jenufa.'' But she was at her best in the 19th- and early-20th-century Italian repertory, and made a specialty of the title role of ''Turandot,'' which she recorded in the 1930's and sang, by her own count, 439 times.         Ms. Cigna was also known for her performances in the title role of ''Tosca,'' which turned out to be the last part she performed onstage. On the way to a performance of the work in 1947, she was injured in an automobile accident. She sang anyway, but had a heart attack after the performance. Afterward, she devoted herself to teaching.       
         Pauline Kael, who expressed her passion for movies in jaunty, jazzy prose as the longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died yesterday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 82.         Ms. Kael was probably the most influential film critic of her time. She reviewed movies for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1979, and again, after working briefly in the film industry, from 1980 until 1991. Earlier, she was a film critic for Life magazine in 1965, for McCall's in 1965 and 1966 and for The New Republic in 1966 and 1967.         Enchanting her fans and infuriating her foes, rarely dull and often sharp and funny, with an intellectualism that reflected her background as a student of philosophy, Ms. Kael was never anything but outspoken.         Whether dismissing auteur theory, reviewing Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' (1975) before it was finished, questioning the extent of Orson Welles's contribution to ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) or proclaiming Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' (1973) as a cultural event comparable to the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Ms. Kael was always provocative. Her seductive writing style bred a legion of acolytes, known as Paulettes.         The critic Louis Menand wrote in The New York Review of Books in March 1995: ''Kael was the most brilliantly ad hoc critic of her time, and she made it possible to care about movies without feeling pompous or giddy by showing that what comes first in everyone's experience of a movie isn't the form or the idea but the sensation, and that this is just as true for moviegoers who have been taught to intellectualize their responses to art as it is for everyone else.''         By the time she retired, Mr. Menand observed, she had produced a generation of inferior imitators. ''The manner of appreciation she invented has become the standard manner of popular culture criticism in America,'' he wrote.         Assessing her impact in a 1998 interview, Ms. Kael said: ''I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They've rarely agreed with me about movies.''         At the same time, she deflected the question of whether her criticism had had any effect on films and filmmakers. ''I'd rather not say,'' she answered. ''If I say yes, I'm an egotist, and if I say no, I've wasted my life. Although I've been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy.''         Overpraising or overdamning was Ms. Kael's way, and she left no doubt about her favorites: actors like Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, John Travolta, Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, and actresses like Joan Cusack, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver and Debra Winger.         She championed films of the 1970's, like Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' (1972) and ''Godfather, Part II'' (1974); Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' (1973) and ''Taxi Driver'' (1976); Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo'' (1975); and Mr. Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971) and ''M*A*S*H'' (1970). She also liked the sensual violence of directors like Sam Peckinpah, whose films included ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and ''Straw Dogs'' (1971), and Brian De Palma, whose works include ''Carrie'' (1976) and ''Casualties of War'' (1989).         ''You know, they talk about the golden age of the cinema as if it took place in the late 30's or in the 40's,'' she said in 1989. ''There was nothing personal and exciting in most of those movies. They were machine tooled. They were a lot of fun. But except for Preston Sturges and a few flukey individualists, they just didn't have the personal voice of the movies of the 70's.''         As a writer whose heyday spanned the years from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) to ''Awakenings'' (1990), ''Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ''L.A. Story'' (1991), Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.         In a 1968 review in The New York Times of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,'' a collection of Ms. Kael's reviews and articles, Eliot Fremont-Smith called her ''the most quotable critic writing; but what is important and bracing is that she relates movies to other experiences, to ideas and attitudes, to ambition, books, money, other movies, to politics and the evolving culture, to moods of the audience, to our sense of ourselves -- to what movies do to us, the acute and self-scrutinizing awareness of which is always at the core of her judgment.''         Reviewing ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) in treacle-curdling prose that reportedly prompted McCall's to dismiss her, Ms. Kael asked, ''Wasn't there perhaps one little Von Trapp who didn't want to sing his head off or who screamed that he wouldn't act out little glockenspiel routines for Papa's party guests, or who got nervous and threw up if he had to get out on a stage?''         Writing about Kevin Costner in ''Dances With Wolves'' (1990), she said he had ''feathers in his hair and feathers in his head.'' Writing about Robert De Niro in ''Awakenings,'' she said, ''It's in the quiet moments that he's particularly bad.'' She also said that that film contained ''another of Robin Williams's benevolent-eunuch roles.''         At her peak, she lauded popular movies like Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' (1975) and Philip Kaufman's ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978) and became more of a supporter of the auteur theory. But in time, Ms. Kael, who attracted notice early in her career by attacking critics like Bosley Crowther of The Times and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, came under fire for predictability and dogmatism.         It was inevitable that she should be the object of criticism herself. George Lucas named the villainous General Kael in ''Willow'' (1988) for her, and in a celebrated onslaught in The New York Review of Books in 1980, the writer Renata Adler declared Ms. Kael's work ''piece by piece, line by line, without interruption, worthless.''         Ms. Adler, a former film critic for The Times, wrote that Ms. Kael's recent work ''falls somewhere between huckster copy and ideological pamphleteering,'' and that ''mistaking lack of civility for vitality, she substitutes for argument a protracted, obsessional invective.''         Assessing her own work, Ms. Kael said: ''I try not to be rough on small films. Generally, when I'm really rough, it's on something that I know is going to be a big hit, and that everybody is going to go for it, and I think it's an atrocity -- that's fair game. I'm interested in discovering talent, and in trying to explain why I think someone is talented. I'm more interested in that than I am in panning.''         Over the years, Ms. Kael's reviews and essays were assembled in a series of books whose double-entendre titles suggested the intimacy of her love affair with movies (she preferred the word ''movies'' to ''film'' or ''cinema''). Among them were ''I Lost It at the Movies'' (1965); ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (1968); ''Going Steady'' (1970); ''Deeper Into Movies'' (1973), a 1974 National Book Award winner; ''Reeling'' (1976); ''When the Lights Go Down'' (1980); ''Hooked'' (1989); ''Movie Love'' (1991); and ''For Keeps'' (1994).         When the last was published, she said in the introduction: ''I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have.''         Central to her approach to criticism was her belief that the popular appeal of movies was rooted in trash. In her essay ''Trash, Art and the Movies,'' reprinted in ''Going Steady,'' Ms. Kael wrote: ''Movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip -- from what was coarse and common.''         She went on to say: ''If we've grown up at the movies, we know that good work is not continuous with the academic, respectable tradition but with glimpses of something good in trash, but we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain of discovery. Trash has given us an appetite for art.''         Ms. Kael's appetite for the movies began in childhood. The fifth child and third daughter of immigrants from Poland, Isaac Paul Kael and the former Judith Friedman, she was born in Petaluma, Calif., on June 19, 1919. She described her father as a gentleman farmer and a moviegoer, and her own trips to see films began early.         Among the favorites she recalled were comedies in the late 1920's that starred Bebe Daniels as a wisecracking flapper; ''Million Dollar Legs'' (1932), with W. C. Fields; and the Marx Brothers's ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933).         For a time the Kaels lived on their Sonoma County farm, which they lost in the Depression. Ms. Kael was 8 when her family moved to San Francisco.         ''A bookish girl from a bookish family'' is the way she once described herself. Blue-eyed, brown-haired, five feet tall and weighing a bit more than 100 pounds, she said: ''I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at 'Kentucky Moonshine,' a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to a movie again.''         In 1936 she enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in philosophy. Despite expectations that she would proceed to law school or teaching, she went to New York with a friend, the poet Robert Horan, for about three years.         When she returned to the Bay Area, she led a bohemian life, tried her hand at writing plays and helped make experimental films. Married and divorced three times, she supported herself and her daughter, Gina James, by writing advertising copy, clerking in a bookstore and working as a cook, a seamstress and a textbook writer.         Ms. Kael never wrote movie criticism until she was 35 and, she said, ''I never made a living at this until I was in my 40's.'' Her career at The New Yorker did not begin until she was nearly 50.         The turning point in her life came, as in a Hollywood script, when she was discovered in a coffee shop in the Bay Area in 1953. She was arguing about a movie with a friend when the editor of City Lights magazine asked them each to review Chaplin's ''Limelight.'' The friend turned in nothing. Ms. Kael's review called the film ''slimelight,'' and a career was born.         Soon Ms. Kael was being published in magazines like Sight and Sound and Partisan Review, and her provocative criticism was being broadcast weekly on KPFA, Berkeley's listener-supported radio station. The radio criticism led to an offer to manage an art theater, which she turned into a two-screen house, the Berkeley Cinema Guild Theaters.         ''I made the displays, wrote the program and cleaned the chewing gum off the seats,'' she said. She revived W. C. Fields, Mae West and Busby Berkeley films and Welles's ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) and showed Ingmar Bergman films before they became staples of art houses elsewhere. ''It was exciting turning up things and drawing an audience to see them,'' she said.         The feisty, funny reviews that she wrote for the programs enhanced her reputation, and she began lecturing on film at universities in San Francisco and Los Angeles.         She was 46 when her essays in Partisan Review led to an offer to publish her first book, ''I Lost It at the Movies,'' a collection of her articles and broadcasts, which became a best seller. In it she praised movies like Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (1937), Vittorio de Sica's ''Shoeshine'' (1946) and Martin Ritt's ''Hud'' (1963). She attacked other critics, poked fun at materialistic movie magnates and derided the pretensions of Alain Resnais's ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), calling it ''the snow job in the ice palace.''         Assignments from magazines began to flow in, and in 1965, Ms. Kael, her daughter and Ms. Kael's two basenjis (dogs that, interestingly, cannot bark) moved to New York.         In 1968, in response to an offer from  William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, who was willing to let her write whatever she wanted and at length, Ms. Kael began to review movies for the magazine. Until 1979, she reviewed weekly from September through March, and Penelope Gilliatt reviewed for the other half of the year.         Ms. Kael's first review for The New Yorker was virtually the only rave that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' received in New York, but it compelled other critics to reconsider their assessments.         At 59, Ms. Kael left The New Yorker for Hollywood. She briefly worked as a production executive for Warren Beatty. After that job ended over what were described as ''artistic differences,'' Paramount Pictures put her under contract as a consultant and scout for several months before she returned to The New Yorker in 1980.         Ms. Gilliatt had departed, and Ms. Kael began writing every two weeks, commuting to New York from a Victorian home on four and a half acres in Massachusetts that she bought for $37,000 in 1970. In New York, she stayed in a hotel for four days and saw two movies nightly. Back home at night, she wrote. Her daughter, an artist, lived nearby with her family.         She is survived by her daughter, Ms. James, of Great Barrington, and a grandson, William Friedman, also of Great Barrington, and two sisters, Anne Wallach and Rose Makower, both of Berkeley.         Ms. Kael was reputed never to see a film more than once, yet she seemed to remember everything, from lighting and costumes to writing, sound, direction and performances.         In 1991, at 71, after 22 years at The New Yorker, Ms. Kael retired from regular reviewing.         Looking back on her impassioned love affair with movies, she once said, ''I was a film critic the way somebody might write poetry, for fun or love.''       
         Barbara K. Olson, who was killed on Tuesday on the commercial jetliner that was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon, was well known to television viewers across the nation as a combative and confident political commentator representing the conservative Republican point of view.         Mrs. Olson, 45, was also half of a highly influential couple on Washington's social-political scene; her husband, Theodore B. Olson, an appellate lawyer, successfully argued the Florida election case for George W. Bush before the Supreme Court. President Bush named Mr. Olson the nation's solicitor general, the official who formulates the administration's strategy before the nation's courts.         Mr. Olson was in his Justice Department office on Tuesday morning when he received two calls from Mrs. Olson, who was using her cell phone aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to tell him the plane had been hijacked. Her description of what was occurring in her last moments provided what officials said was valuable information about the incident. She reported that the flight crew had been herded to the back of the plane with the passengers, and she asked her husband what she should tell the pilot who was apparently beside her while the hijackers were in control of the cockpit.         Mrs. Olson's friends and her husband said her efforts to ''do something'' on the doomed plane were exquisitely in character. ''She never sat back,'' her husband said in an interview.         The Olsons, who were married four years ago, complemented each other in style. Mrs. Olson was the more outspoken of the two in her televised commentaries, while Mr. Olson presented a more deliberative face in his role as the reigning constitutional litigator for the Republican establishment.         Although Mrs. Olson was generally a take-no-prisoners advocate, Mr. Olson recalled on Tuesday that she recently told him she had come to believe that the national political debate had become too acrimonious. He recalled that she said that during one television appearance, she believed those who called in comments to her and her liberal counterpart, Bill Press, were far too harsh.         Barbara Kay Bracher Olson was born on Dec. 27, 1955, in Houston, and trained to be a teacher at the University of St. Thomas in her hometown. But, she had told friends, she wanted to save enough money to go to law school and decided a quicker way to do so than teaching was to become a part of the film industry.         With no experience in the field but  an abundance of self-confidence, she moved to Hollywood and began telephoning production companies connected to well-known actors, offering herself as an all-around helper. Stacy Keach finally offered her a job, Mr. Olson recalled this week, and when she saved enough money to go to law school, she moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Olson turned down jobs in New York after law school because she yearned to live in Washington. As chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Republican majority from  1995 to 1996, Mrs. Olson led the investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in firing longtime employees of the White House travel office. She became a caustic and relentless critic of the Clintons.         Mrs. Olson wrote ''Hell to Pay'' (Regnery, 1999), a highly critical book about Mrs. Clinton, and recently finished a sequel, ''Final Days,'' about the Clintons' last weeks in the White House. Mr. Olson said it would be published by Regnery.         Mrs. Olson is survived by her brother, David Bracher, and her sister, Antoinette Lawrence, both of Houston, as well as her husband.       
         Etta Jones, a great and permanently underrated jazz singer who for three decades toured constantly with her musical partner, the saxophonist Houston Person, died on Tuesday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Joe Fields, the manager of her record label, High Note.         Born in Aiken, S.C., and reared in Harlem, Ms. Jones early on developed wily devices for a small voice.  She used silence, the sound of the breath, a quick yodel here and there, lyric readings that drew out or shut down syllables idiosyncratically, and a sliding pitch that made her an extraordinary blues singer. Billie Holiday was the most obvious and famous precedent for her style, and she was capable of astonishingly close Holiday impersonations, though she rarely let her audiences hear them.         But her hard-edged blues sensibility owed something to Dinah Washington, while her highly improvised phrasing came from horn players like Sonny Stitt. Ms. Jones always cited as an influence Thelma Carpenter, a onetime Count Basie vocalist who became a heavy-vibrato torch singer. Neither a shouter, a whisperer nor a bebopper, Ms. Jones clung fast to a set of jazz standards from the 1940's and 50's, and tunes by composers like Sammy Cahn, her favorite, whose songs are the subject of her 1999 album, ''All the Way.''         With Mr. Person, her musical partner of more than 30 years, Ms. Jones toured the country, still playing often to primarily black audiences, but also by the late 90's appearing twice a year at the Village Vanguard in Manhattan and at international jazz festivals; she was an evergreen presence in the New York jazz world, and kept up her concert schedule until two weeks before her death.         At 15, Ms. Jones sang at the Apollo Theater's amateur night in the summer of 1944, and immediately after her performance she auditioned for and won a job singing with Buddy Johnson, who led a 19-man band. Johnson's group played in a common vernacular jazz style of the 40's -- a mixture of rhythm-and-blues and jump blues -- and, as a second-tier group not as popular as the likes of Basie, Ellington and Eckstine, the band toured black-only clubs and auditoriums throughout the country.         Her job was as a temporary replacement for Ella Johnson, Buddy Johnson's sister, who was on a maternity leave. When Ella Johnson returned to the band, Ms. Jones began working for different groups until the early 1950's, among them the Harlemaires and bands, from medium-size to big, led by Barney Bigard, Pete Johnson, Earl Hines, J. C. Heard and Sonny Stitt.         In 1952 she began eight years of semiretirement, singing intermittently. Finally, in 1960, she was contracted by Prestige Records, and recorded ''Don't Go to Strangers,'' which became a Top 40, million-selling hit, changing her weekly income, as she once put it, from $50 to $750.         By the end of the 1960's, she had developed a trusting partnership with Mr. Person, a big-toned saxophonist. In performance they developed a conversational style of answering each other's lines. ''He knows exactly what I'm going to do,'' she once said. ''He knows if I'm in trouble; he'll give me the note. He leaves me room.'' They were always billed equally, an unusual arrangement for any jazz singer. Starting in 1976, they began recording for Muse, which later changed its name to High Note, and Mr. Person became her manager and record producer through 18 records.         She had three Grammy nominations, for the ''Don't Go to Strangers'' LP in 1960, ''Save Your Love for Me'' in 1981 and ''My Buddy'' in 1999. But she never recorded for a major label; her temperament was decidedly unlike a diva; and outside of the small period of time around ''Don't Go to Strangers,'' she never commanded high concert fees.         Ms. Jones is survived by her husband, John Medlock, of Washington; a granddaughter, Lia Greatheart-Mitchell of Mount Vernon; and sisters Edna Taylor of Akron, Ohio, and Georgia Johnson of Aiken.         Her new and final High Note album appeared in stores on the day she died, ''Etta Jones Sings Lady Day.''       
         Carrie Donovan, a fashion editor who could easily have rested on her laurels and leopard skins but came out of semiretirement to find a new and even more enthusiastic audience as ''the lady from Old Navy,'' died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ailing for several months, said George O'Brien, a friend, and died at New York Weill Cornell Center.         From the beginning, Ms. Donovan's career had a screwball quality worthy of Hollywood. Though she studied dressmaking at the Parsons School of Design, she could never master a needle and thread. She lacked a similar command of automobiles and typewriters, and as a reporter for The New York Times, then as an editor for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and The New York Times Magazine, she wrote all her copy by hand.         And though she was among the first to applaud the designs of Donna Karan and Perry Ellis and brought a virtually unknown Elsa Peretti to the attention of Tiffany, Ms. Donovan was something of an Auntie Mame when it came to managing her own affairs. Money was silk in her fingers, and the rest was often serendipity.         ''She was perfectly cast for a fashion editor,'' said Karl Lagerfeld, the designer. ''She was the leading lady of that role.''         What Ms. Donovan possessed was an eye for talent and a nose for news, a combination that, with her inevitable pearls and outsized black glasses, set her apart from her fashion sisters. She loved the fantastical, which was reflected in her Upper East Side apartment -- with its red walls, red furnishings and leopard carpeting -- but in her editorial pages she was adamantly on the side of readers. She may have been French in her leanings, sprinkling her pronouncements with French même choses, but in her translations of fashion's edicts, she was as American as Carrie.         As her mentor Diana Vreeland once told her: ''My dear, you've got the common touch!''         Nowhere did she apply this more surprisingly than in her television ads for Old Navy, which began running in fall 1997. In all, Ms. Donovan appeared in 42 spots, including one that featured her piloting an airplane with a dog named Magic. If Ms. Donovan, the last of a trilogy of great fashion dames that included Mrs. Vreeland and Carmel Snow of Bazaar, reigned in a small world, she now had fans everywhere. Teenagers and grandmothers alike hailed her in the street, sometimes singing an Old Navy jingle.         ''She was tickled pink,'' the director Joel Schumacher, a friend since the 1960's, said of her new visibility. ''It made her a celebrity.''         As a child in Lake Placid, N.Y., where Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born on March 22, 1928, she craved fashion, and struggled with home economics. At 10, she sent the actress Jane Wyman sketches for a wardrobe, and received a handwritten reply.         Her first job was in the hat department at Saks under the imperious Tatiana Liberman, whose husband was Alexander Liberman of Vogue. By the time Ms. Donovan graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1950, she had formed friendships with two of the world's leading dressmakers, Norman Norell and Jacques Fath. More would follow.         But Ms. Donovan's outgoing personality masked an ambivalent relationship with her mother, Margaret, and an isolated childhood spent with grandparents. She and her sister, Joan Donovan, saw nothing of their father, who left the family early, and the girls did not live regularly with their mother until 1942, when the independent-minded Margaret was working for a war production factory in Brooklyn. She later received a teaching degree from Columbia University.         All her career, Ms. Donovan, who  is survived by her sister, of Cambridge, Mass., left the impression that she and Margaret were opposites.         In 1955, recognizing her limitations as a designer, Ms. Donovan went to work as a fashion reporter for The Times, where, according to Mr. O'Brien, a former colleague, she felt outgunned by more experienced writers. She persevered, snaring an interview with Mrs. Vreeland in 1963, when she went to Vogue, and Ms. Donovan soon joined the magazine as one of Mrs. Vreeland's acolytes.         At Vogue, Ms. Donovan flourished, filling her pages with the new and the exciting. She wrote about a young Mr. Schumacher when he and some friends opened a shop called Paraphernalia. On another occasion, a former staff member recalled being sent out to the lobby to tell a group of young men waiting for Ms. Donovan not to sit on the floor. They turned out to be Jim Morrison and the Doors.         She inherited Mrs. Vreeland's mannerisms, like the fortissimo ''divine!'' but not her mantle, and when Mrs. Vreeland was fired from Vogue in 1971, Ms. Donovan decamped for Bazaar. By then, Ms. Donovan had switched from wearing chaste Mainbocher to chic Halston, and like her friends, the decorators Chessy Rayner and Mica Ertegun, she had taken to covering her blond bob with a turban.         Like other editors of that era, Ms. Donovan was an instigator as well as a tastemaker. In February 1974, she helped bring Tiffany and Ms. Peretti together. The designer said Ms. Donovan had the idea that contemporary jewelry would bring the white-glove store a new customer. Today, that arrangement is a $250 million business. ''Nobody would do a favor like this now,'' Ms. Peretti said.         Unable to perform similar magic at Bloomingdale's, where she worked briefly as a public relations executive, Ms. Donovan returned to The Times in 1977 as style editor of the magazine. At their first meeting, Edward Klein, then editor of the magazine, recalled that Ms. Donovan produced some colored markers and began sketching out her plans, all in a brisk monologue of ''mmm's'' and exclamation points. Mr. Klein had no idea what she was talking about.         Ms. Donovan was not unaware of her effect, least of all on newspapermen. Armed with tidbits of fashion gossip and ''always fully fragranced,'' as a former protégée, Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, said, Ms. Donovan could turn a routine meeting into a performance. Yet, as her editors knew, her flamboyance was balanced by a pragmatic streak that for 16 years pleased both readers and advertisers.         These were her best years. She introduced readers to Ms. Karan and Paloma Picasso. She documented the opulence of the 1980's and ushered in the next decade by photographing the trendiest clothes on people in their 90's.         Although in many ways Ms. Donovan was simple in her tastes, preferring plain food and the subway, she was also at home in the upper reaches of fashion and society, a friend to Mr. Lagerfeld as well as the philanthropist Bunny Mellon. While this access improved her insight, it occasionally impaired her objectivity.         At the same time, her more dogmatic assertions often betrayed a deeper need to burn her bridges. She and Bill Blass, a frequent escort, fell out in 1993 when Ms. Donovan excluded him from a published list of 50 people who had influenced fashion in modern times.         In 1997, as if to disprove the dictum  that there are no second acts in American life, Ms. Donovan went to work for Old Navy, playing herself to the hilt. The ads, which brought her financial security, drew on her flamboyant image to promote earthly things like cargo pants.         ''She gave us fashion credibility,'' said Dennis Leggett, the creative director at Old Navy, a division of Gap.         In the final months of her life, Ms. Donovan returned to where her career had begun, The Times. She wrote in its magazine about a little-known designer named Marjan Pejoski, whose feathered-swan dress for the singer Bjork had caused a stir at the Academy Awards. She thought Mr. Pejoski had flair.

         Megan Boyd, whose fabled expertise at tying enchantingly delicate fishing flies put her work in museums and the hands of collectors around the world and prompted Queen Elizabeth II to award her the British Empire Medal, died Nov. 15 in Golspie, Scotland. She was 86.         She did not receive her award from the queen, to whom she explained that she had no one to care for her dog that day. The queen said she quite understood, and Prince Charles, an avid user of her flies, later made the presentation at his nearby Scottish fishing lodge in 1971.         The episode reflected Miss Boyd's unpremeditated eccentricity, also suggested by her usual dress: a man's shirt and tie, sweater, wool skirt, tweed sport jacket and heavy army-style boots. But the flies she dressed at a small table in front of a window and under a gas lamp -- she had no electricity until 1985 -- were regarded by connoisseurs as ''the Tiffanies of the 20th century,'' according to The American Fly Fisher magazine.         From tiny strands of hair she made magic: the classic Scottish flies like the Jock Scott, Silver Doctor and Durham Ranger; American favorites like the Green Butt and Woolly Hugger; and the fly named after her, the Megan Boyd, a nifty blue and black number famous for attracting salmon at the height of summer, when the water is low, hot and dead.         ''Her attention to detail was perfection par excellence,'' said Jimmie Ferard, an English fly fisherman who owns more than 2,000 of Miss Boyd's flies. ''She took such trouble with every fly she tied.''         She liked to sell to fishermen she knew, the ones who lived nearby. Her prices never exceeded a dollar.         ''A Megan Boyd fly is a $1,000 fly,'' said Gary Tanner, director of the American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vt.         Rosina Megan Boyd, the youngest of three children, is believed to have been born in England on Jan. 29, 1915. In 1918, her father took a job as a riverkeeper, or private game warden, on an estate in Sutherland County in the Scottish Highlands. Another keeper, Bob Trussler, taught her the craft by having her disassemble a finished fly and then reconstruct it on a smaller hook.         She had little formal education but loved to learn everything about the Brora, the river that flowed through the town of the same name where she grew up. During World War II, she held various jobs, including delivering milk and working for the coast guard auxiliary.         At 20, she moved into a small red-and-white cottage perched on a hillside in the village of Kintradwell, and she lived there for 53 years. By personal preference, she had no running water, electricity, telephone or television. She cut her own hair in a style the British call an Eaton crop.         Her studio was a corrugated iron shed with a rusted red tin roof. She spent 14 to 16 hours a day, six or seven days a week, at her workbench, a kidney-shaped dressing table.         But she was dedicated to supplying the fishermen she knew who fished rivers she had learned intimately. Under the mat at her front door was a pad and pencil for the locals to write down their orders.         ''As long as I was tying flies for the fishermen, which I started off doing to earn my daily bread, I kept doing it,'' she said in an interview with The Atlantic Salmon Fly. ''All the other orders had to go to the bottom of the pile.''         She retired in 1985, when she was 70, because of deteriorating eyesight.         ''I knew my eyesight was failing because I was making bigger heads on the flies,'' she said, ''and once you start to do that, it's no use.''         An aide to Prince Charles once showed up and asked that she quickly whip up a masterpiece or two. She declined, saying that was going to a Scottish dance in the village. She loved the traditional dances.         The prince held no grudge. He visited her last year in the nursing home where she had lived in recent years.         She would teach fly-tying to anyone who asked but she said she was unable to find a suitable heir.         ''There is just one man I taught that could tie a decent fly,'' she said. ''He is dead now. The modern ones just want to tie something quick and scrappy and sell it.''         Miss Boyd, who never married and has no survivors, never caught a fish. She never even went fishing.         ''I wouldn't kill a salmon if I got one,'' she said.
