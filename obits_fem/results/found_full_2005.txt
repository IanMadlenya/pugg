         Miriam Rothschild, the heiress who discovered how fleas jump, brought Chaucerian wildflowers back to modern England and was acknowledged as one of the world's most distinguished naturalists, died Thursday at her home, Ashton Wold, in Northamptonshire. She was 96.         Her death was announced by her family.         Her extensive scientific and conservation achievements were matched by the might of her will and her delectably eccentric personality.         ''Imagine Beatrix Potter on amphetamines,'' The Times of London once said of her.         Though she viewed herself as a naturalist, more of a describer than an experimenter, she was taken seriously as a scientist and often worked with distinguished colleagues. Her well-known work on butterflies making themselves toxic by means of their food choices was done with the chemist Tadeus Reichstein, a Nobel Prize winner. Her highly original observations helped confirm 19th-century theories of evolution that had awaited 20th-century chemistry.         Given the title of dame by the queen in 1999 for her scientific achievements, she was more than a scientist, not least because she never had to fill out a grant application.         Was it odd that a scion of the venerable Rothschild clan should become the world's leading expert on fleas? Hardly. Dame Miriam's father was the banker Nathaniel Charles Rothschild, who found more than 500 new species of fleas. His daughter's six-volume catalog of his collection of 30,000 specimens, which she completed in 20 years beginning in 1953, firmly established her as the flea authority other experts consulted.         Her uncle Lionel Walter Rothschild's collections were just as inspirational. He amassed 2.3 million butterflies, 300,000 bird skins, 144 giant tortoises and 300,000 birds' eggs, among other things..         From her earliest youth, Dame Miriam loved animals and plants. Her mind was free to roam, and she received no formal education until she was 17, when she demanded to go to school. She never earned any degree, but received an honorary doctorate from Oxford in 1968.         Ranging from marine biology to chemistry to pharmacology to neurophysiology to horticulture to zoology, she came up with novel, often startling conclusions.         Her research on insects eating substances that are poisonous to their predators was considered groundbreaking. After determining that butterflies' bright colors were warning signals of their toxicity, she found that other species evolved to mimic the danger-sign coloration. She found that odors emitted by toxic butterflies were mimicked by other species, vindicating 19th-century naturalists' speculations.         Her enthusiasm for wildflowers led to her advising Prince Charles on plantings for his estate and Lady Bird Johnson on her program to beautify American roadsides.         Her interests ranged far beyond science. During World War II she tenaciously pressed the British authorities to admit more Jews from Nazi Germany and at one point personally housed 49 Jewish children. She worked in the top-secret British effort at Bletchley Park to crack the Nazis' code.         She fought for cause upon cause, including better treatment for laboratory animals, rights for homosexuals and free milk for schoolchildren.         Her farm at the family estate of Ashton Wold, near Peterborough, was a passion and her main source of income. Her livestock and plants won awards.         She did it all with a zestfully personal sense of style, wearing the loose-fitting clothes she designed for herself 50 years ago as she walked the grounds with her half-dozen pet Shetland sheepdogs.         Miriam Louisa Rothschild was born on Aug. 5, 1908, at Ashton Wold, where she lived her entire life. Her mother, Rozika de Wertheimstein, was a top Hungarian sportswoman, and Dame Miriam herself played tennis, cricket and squash, the last in international competitions.         Her childhood, as described in a 1987 New Yorker profile by Kennedy Fraser, was ''like a fairy tale: the palatial houses stuffed with mysteries and treasures; the grandfather who liked to shower gold half-sovereigns from his carriage; the brilliant dotty uncle with his cassowaries and his white top hat.''         Her first love was nature. By the age of 4 she was collecting ladybugs and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her.         Her world darkened when she was 15 and her father committed suicide. She temporarily lost interest in his passion, the natural world. But a year or two later, her enthusiasm was rekindled when she helped her brother dissect a frog.         ''I had never before seen fresh, internal organs, blood vessels and nerves,'' she wrote in an essay in Scientific American. Calling the experience ''my road to Damascus,'' she wrote, ''Their extreme beauty was a revelation.''         After taking some courses at the University of London, she worked in Naples and England studying a kind of mollusk.         ''During the first day of dissecting the bivalve,'' she wrote in Scientific American, ''I found a specimen infested with larval trematodes,'' which are parasitic flatworms known as flukes. ''It proved to be a hitherto undescribed species and a most extraordinary one from every point of view. My fate was sealed. I was completely hooked.''         She worked 16-hour days studying trematodes until a German bomb destroyed all traces of seven years of her research.         With the war, she passed a test to be an air warden but was first assigned to work as a dairymaid. She was secretly summoned to work on the top-secret Enigma code-breaking project and labored 12 hours a day for several years with Alan Turing.         In 1943 she married George Lane, a handsome Hungarian-born British commando. They had four children and adopted two more before divorcing in 1957. She is survived by one of her sons and three of her daughters.         As she raised her children, her late-night attention turned to fleas. She began writing about them in clear, engaging prose.         In ''Fleas, Flukes & Cuckoos: A Study of Bird Parasites,'' which she wrote with Theresa Clay in 1952 (Philosophical Library), she argued that most people misunderstood fleas.         ''It is difficult for them to realize that fleas breathe through holes in their sides, have a nerve cord below their stomachs and a heart in their backs; or that certain arthropods lay eggs through their heads and regularly practice virgin birth.''         Using high-speed photography, she studied how fleas jump. She theorized that they descended from winged ancestors and employed modified flight structures. In a famous comparison, she said fleas jump as high for fleas as the Empire State Building would be for humans.         Turning to plants as well as animals, she became one of the first practitioners of the new interdisciplinary approach to biological studies called ecology.         She began designing gardens to attract butterflies, writing extensively on the subject.         ''You can really abandon any romantic idea of creating a home for these angelic creatures,'' she wrote in ''The Butterfly Gardener,'' published in 1983. ''The best you can do is provide them with a good pub.'' She owned a pub for humans, in Ashton, decorated with natural history exhibits.         In 1970 she began to collect, propagate and sell wildflower seeds.         ''In the early 1980's, I went to a lecture given by a distinguished zoologist who said we should preserve our medieval hayfields, because it would take a thousand years to grow one from scratch,'' she said. ''After the lecture I told him I had done a good imitation in 10. From that moment, I thought I should spread the gospel.''         Spread it she did, to Mrs. Johnson and Prince Charles. As a result of the movement she led, British agriculture policies that favored replacing natural meadows with rye grass were reversed.         She remained as down to earth as the stone ruin her own house became as she deliberately let an immense tangle of ivy, wisteria, clematis and roses envelop it.       
         Yolanda Garcia, a South Bronx community advocate who forced planners and politicians to rethink how they would rebuild a sprawling swath of the Melrose section, died on Thursday. She was 53.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Yolanda Gonzalez. She was stricken at the office of Nos Quedamos/We Stay, the community group she helped found in the early 1990's to prevent the eviction of hundreds of people who lived and worked in the neighborhood.         The vow embodied by the group's name became a rallying cry for Ms. Garcia, after she and her neighbors learned of a city redevelopment plan that would transform 30 blocks from rubble-covered lots into buildings that would house 4,000 families.         In a story she would recount often, proudly and with a wry smile, they found out about the plan by accident in 1992, when a resident noticed a city worker outside her house jotting down notes. Residents soon learned that the city had begun surveying the area to see which buildings were still occupied and who might have to be relocated as part of the Melrose Commons redevelopment plan.         Incensed by the idea that their reward for enduring years of abandonment, arson and crime would be eviction, they confronted officials during public hearings. Ms. Garcia, whose family owned a carpet store on Third Avenue, became one of the more outspoken leaders.         ''If this area deteriorated, it wasn't because of the people -- it deteriorated because of poor city planning,'' Ms. Garcia told The New York Times in 1993. ''If we kept our area up when it was in dire need of repair, we should be part of the progress.''         The confrontation turned into collaboration as politicians and planners invited the group to work alongside architects not only to critique the original plan, but also to redefine it. An apartment on Courtlandt Avenue was turned into a planning studio, where nearby residents pored over architectural drawings and models.         Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president at the time and a proponent of the redevelopment plan, said Ms. Garcia offered insights that had to be heeded.         ''She was right,'' he said in an interview yesterday. ''They stuck it out in the toughest of times, and they were saying to government: 'You're planning for my neighborhood? Ask me.'''         Their suggestions ranged from allowing for lower-density housing to including numerous smaller gardens. The group sponsored construction of several dozen town houses and currently has 750 more units of rental and cooperative apartments in the pipeline. Their efforts became a model for community-based planning, said Richard Kahan, the former head of the New York State Urban Development Corporation who was active in the Melrose Commons plan.         Ms. Garcia was born in Santurce, P.R., and moved with her family to the Bronx when she was 6 months old. The family members moved often, always within the borough, as did their carpet business. She was helping run the business on a stretch of Third Avenue that had seen better days, when she became active in civic affairs.         She closed the carpet business several years ago to devote herself full time to her community work.         She is survived by her daughter, and one relentless community group.       
         Elsa H. Zion, a city official and former publishing executive who campaigned successfully to regulate the workload of interns and residents in New York State's hospitals after the highly publicized death of her daughter, Libby, in 1984, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her husband, the journalist Sidney Zion.         For a decade, until shortly before her death, Ms. Zion was the deputy director of the Bureau of Senior Services, Resources and Partnerships at the New York City Department for the Aging. She was previously an assistant to Andrew J. Stein, then the City Council president.         Libby Zion was 18 when she died in New York Hospital on March 5, 1984, having been admitted eight hours earlier with a high fever. In 1987, a grand jury report cited errors that it said could have contributed to her death. These included being given a painkiller that can interact lethally with the antidepressant drug that she had told doctors she was taking and remaining unmonitored by a doctor for four hours, during which time her temperature rose to 108 degrees. The hospital admitted in 1987 that it had failed to provide adequate care for her, and the State Department of Health fined it $13,000.         After her death, the Zions pushed for limitations on the number of hours medical interns and residents could work each week, and in 1989, New York State adopted regulations limiting interns' and residents' hours and increasing their supervision by senior doctors.         In 1995, a jury in a negligence suit brought by the Zions against the hospital and the doctors who treated their daughter found that an intern and two other doctors had contributed to her death. The jury absolved the hospital of wrongdoing.         Elsa Ruth Heister was born in Winthrop, N.Y., on Feb. 24, 1935. She earned a bachelor's degree from Bard College and a master's in library science from the University of Chicago. In the 1970's and early 80's, she was president of Transworld Feature Syndicate.         Besides her husband, a columnist for The Daily News, Ms. Zion is survived by two sisters, Sandra, of San Francisco, and Martha, of Miami; two brothers, Karl, of Portland, Me., and Robert, of Miami; two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn, and Jed, of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.       
         Opal Petty, whose lawsuit over her 51-year involuntary commitment in Texas mental institutions led to changes in state policy, died on March 10 in San Angelo, Tex. She was 86 and lived in Christoval, Tex.         The cause was pneumonia, said Linda Kauffman, the wife of Ms. Petty's nephew, Clint Denson.         Ms. Kauffman learned by chance at a 1986 reunion of her husband's family that Ms. Petty had been committed by her family to a state hospital in 1934, when she was 16. No one at the reunion knew exactly where she was at the time, Ms. Kauffman said in an interview, only that she was in some facility near where Ms. Kauffman lived.         When she got home to San Angelo, Ms. Kauffman called the institution closest to her home -- the San Angelo State School, in Carlsbad -- and found that Ms. Petty was indeed confined there.         She began to see Ms. Petty and arranged for her to make visits to the Denson home. The more she got to know Ms. Petty, Ms. Kauffman said, the more nervous and uncooperative school officials became.         Eventually she sought legal advice and was directed to Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who filed suit on Ms. Petty's behalf. Through pretrial discovery, it was learned that she had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. But her lawyers argued that at worst she had had a psychotic depression. They also said she had suffered irreparable harm from being held in a ''prison-like environment'' for so long.         Dr. Jefferson Nelson, an Austin psychiatrist, testified, based on Ms. Petty's records and a personal examination, that she was psychotic when she was admitted, but that her symptoms quickly subsided, and that she should have been released.         He also testified that as a result of being institutionalized, Ms. Petty was afflicted with an ''institutional syndrome'' that left her withdrawn and unable to express emotion.         In 1989, the jury found the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation guilty of negligence and awarded Ms. Petty $505,000, which was reduced to $350,000 because of a state law that limits damages resulting from the actions of state employees, Mr. Harrington said in an interview.         As a result of the suit, the state made several changes, among them enacting annual hearings for all those who are confined, with the result that several other people were released from state institutions.         Ms. Petty was born on April 28, 1918, in Mills County, Tex., the third of six children of Robert Clinton Petty, a farmer, and Willie Mae Petty.         Mr. Harrington said: ''Being fundamentalist Baptists her family didn't approve of her wanting to go out dancing and such things. A church exorcism didn't work, so the family made the decision to commit her. One of her girl friends said she didn't see anything wrong with her.''         After Ms. Kauffman found her, Ms. Petty was furloughed from the state school and lived with Ms. Kauffman and her husband for almost 20 years. She was employed at a workshop for people with mental disabilities, and bought dolls to add to a collection she had started while confined.         ''They were her family,'' Ms. Kauffman said. ''When she was buried she was surrounded by her dolls.''       
         Andre Norton, a prolific and popular science-fiction and fantasy writer whose central theme was the rite of passage to self-realization undertaken by misfits or displaced outsiders, died yesterday at her home in Murfreesboro, Tenn. She was 93.         The cause was congestive heart failure, Sue Stewart, her friend and caretaker, said.         In more than 130 novels, nearly 100 short stories and numerous anthologies that Ms. Norton edited in the science-fiction, fantasy, mystery and western genres, the theme of alienation and return keeps recurring.         In a typical story, ''Star Man's Son, 2250 A.D.'' (Harcourt, 1952) -- her first science-fiction novel -- Fors, a mutant rejected by a postwar society because of his differences, goes in search of a lost city rumored to be free of radiation. Accompanied by a cat with which he communicates telepathically, Fors discovers his own worth through a string of difficult tests.         ''Star Man's Son'' was the relatively late start of Ms. Norton's science fiction career; until then, she had mainly been a novelist writing juvenile historical fiction and adventure stories, under the pen name Andre Norton, chosen because her readers were thought to be exclusively boys         At the time, the market for science-fiction was largely confined to magazines, but with the growth of the genre in book form after 1950, Ms. Norton took the field by storm. Donald A. Wollheim, editor of the paperback house Ace Books, saw her potential in an adult market, acquired the rights to ''Starman's Son,'' published it under the title ''Daybreak -- 2250 A.D.,'' eliminating all references to the story and its author as being for young readers, and found himself with a steady seller.         Although Ms. Norton's subsequent books for Ace sold in the hundreds of thousands, she found herself the victim of a Catch-22: critics of science fiction did not take her seriously because she was considered a juvenile writer and critics of children's literature dismissed her because she wrote science fiction.         Her legions of readers remained loyal, however, and critics eventually came to take her seriously. She was the first woman to win the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy award and the Nebula Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement from the Science Fiction Writers of America.         Her work was praised for its unobtrusive depth and complexity. As Francis J. Molson wrote in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, ''It is possible that the pace and suspense of Norton's storytelling may so ensnare readers that they may overlook the themes and concerns her narratives embody.''         Foremost among those themes, many of her readers have said, was her insistence that personal fulfillment required accepting the individual's contradictions, whether they were sexual, racial or otherwise. For instance, the villains in her most popular series, ''Witch World,'' comprising about 30 volumes, are the females who think falsely that they have to remain virginal to retain their power.         In the same vein, Ms. Norton deplored people's embrace of technology.         ''I think the human race made a bad mistake at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,'' she told Charles Platt in an interview for his ''Dream Makers Volume II: The Uncommon Men and Women Who Write Science Fiction'' (1983). ''We leaped for the mechanical things.''         She added, ''People need the use of their hands to feel creative.''         Alice Mary Norton, who changed her name legally to Andre Norton in 1934, was born on Feb. 17, 1912, in Cleveland, Ohio, the younger of two daughters of Adalbert Freely Norton, a rug salesman, and Bertha Stemm Norton. At Collingwood High School she wrote for the school newspaper and during her senior year produced her first novel, which, reworked, became her second published book, ''Ralestone Luck'' (Appleton, 1938).         Intending to become a history teacher, she attended Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) but was forced to drop out in her freshman year because of the Depression. Taking a job at the Cleveland Public Library, she was assigned to the children's book section, allowing her to become expert in the literature. Though already interested in science fiction, she turned to writing history for young adults, publishing her first novel, ''The Prince Commands'' (Appleton, 1934), at 22.         Continuing to publish adventure novels, she stayed at the library until 1950, working in 38 of its 40 branches. In 1941, she interrupted that stint to work at the Library of Congress and to own a bookstore in Maryland. In 1950, she took a job as a reader at Gnome Press, the science-fiction publisher, and continued to write on the side. By the time she left, in 1958, to become a full-time writer, she had published 23 novels and several short stories. In the next two decades she wrote almost 70 novels and two dozen short stories, and edited several anthologies. She also collaborated with many writers.         In 1966, she moved to Florida and later to Murfreesboro, where in 1999 she founded High Hallack, a retreat and research library for writers that she closed in 2004.       
         Lisa Fittko, who achieved fame, particularly in Germany, by leading Jews and members of the anti-Hitler resistance from Nazi-occupied France to Spain, died on March 12 in Chicago. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, said Evelyn Marsh, her niece.         Ms. Fittko emerged from a leftist, artistic family to become active in the resistance to Hitler in the early months of his rule, then fled to continue the fight in other European countries for seven years. For seven tense months in 1940 and 1941, she escorted refugees on a tortuous path over the Pyrenees mountains so they could go on to Spanish and Portuguese ports to seek passage to safe havens.         Many of the people she helped were intellectuals, artists and anti-Nazi organizers. The first refugee she helped was Walter Benjamin, a Marxist literary critic and philosopher whose work has drawn new interest in recent years because of his provocative insights on subjects from consumerism to surrealism.         But that initial mission was thwarted when the Spanish authorities ordered the group to return to France because they lacked proper exit visas, a requirement that had not been enforced in the past and was ignored in the future. Mr. Benjamin died at the age of 48 in Room No.4 on the second floor of the Hotel de Francia, a cheap pension in Port-Bou, Spain, on Sept. 27, 1940, having apparently committed suicide.         Ms. Fittko had earlier helped the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who had been her friend in Paris, get out of a prison in France.         Ms. Fittko and her husband, Hans, became part of the rescue mission of Varian Fry, an American who is credited with saving about 2,000 people, many of them artists and intellectuals, including André Breton, Marc Chagall and Max Ernst.         Miriam Hansen, a professor of English and cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, said Ms. Fittko became well known in postwar Germany because Germans liked to find and honor people who resisted Hitler. She said Ms. Fittko's death was announced on German radio and television, and obituaries appeared in the major national newspapers. In 1986, the president of West Germany awarded her the Distinguished Medal of Merit, First Class.         In the United States, Ms. Fittko's story was eventually documented in several novels and films, including the 1998 documentary ''Lisa Fittko: But We Said We Will Not Surrender.''         She wrote two books about her experiences. One, ''Escape Through the Pyrenees,'' which was first published in West Germany in 1985, won that country's award for the political book of the year. It was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and, in 1991, into English by Northwestern University Press. The same press in 1993 published her ''Solidarity and Treason: Resistance and Exile, 1933-1940.''         Lisa Ekstein was born in 1909 in Uzhgorod in what was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; it later became part of Czechoslovakia, then part of the Soviet Union and today is part of Ukraine. Most of her childhood was spent in Budapest and Vienna; she was evacuated and sent to the Netherlands with other children for a year during World War I. After the war, her family moved to Berlin.         Through her father, a writer and a publicist for avant-garde artists there, she met many members of the Weimar intelligentsia.         While still in high school, she joined what Ms. Hansen characterized as a Communist organization. She wrote and distributed leaflets protesting torture in Nazi prisons.         At 24 she was working as a secretary and went to a rally to see Hitler. She was reprimanded for not raising her arm in salute. She told an interviewer from The Vancouver Sun in 1999 that her failure to do so was hardly intentional.         ''I was stupid, but not that stupid,'' she said.         She was soon pursued by the Gestapo, and in 1933, she fled to Prague, where she met Hans Fittko, a fellow exile and an even more committed leftist whom the Nazis sought to kill. They married on their odyssey through, among other places, Basel and Amsterdam, ending up in Paris in 1938. There, they continued helping refugees.         After Germany invaded France, Ms. Fittko was detained for a few months in a concentration camp for women at Gurs, France, along with others who had lived in Germany. It was there she aided her friend and fellow prisoner Hannah Arendt by helping to supply her with a stolen release document.         After the Fittkos found each other again, they made their way to Marseille, dodging the French authorities who were collaborating with the Germans. They planned to escape through Spain but separated because the Spanish had begun arresting men who they feared might make their way to Britain to fight Hitler.         Mr. Fittko tried to find sea passage from Marseille to Casablanca. His wife, as originally planned, had gone to the border to find a way to escape by land. In September 1940, Walter Benjamin knocked on the door of her room in Port-Vendres, saying Mr. Fittko had told him to ask her for help.         With the assistance of a local socialist mayor, who gave her an old map, she led Mr. Benjamin and two other refugees across the mountains to Port-Bou, a Spanish border town. Mr. Benjamin died there after swallowing some of the 50 morphine tablets he had earlier split with his friend Arthur Koestler.         Mr. Benjamin had been carrying a heavy, bulging briefcase that he told Ms. Fittko contained ''the only copy of his latest writing.'' She wrote that he said it was ''more important than I am, more important than myself.''         The briefcase was lost after his death and its contents remain unknown.         For years people suspected that it might have been his lost work on the Parisian arcades, iron-and-glass-roofed shopping corridors, which provoked penetrating philosophical insights on the part of Mr. Benjamin. But those papers were discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, where Mr. Benjamin's friend the essayist Georges Batailles had hidden them from the Nazis. They were published in West Germany in 1982.         Howard Eiland, who translated them as ''The Arcades Project,'' published in 1999 by Harvard University Press, said the contents of the lost briefcase remained a mystery. He said, ''This sounds like it was something completely different that no one knows about.''         Ms. Fittko was soon joined on the French side of the border by her husband, who had not been able to find sea passage. They delayed their own escape when Mr. Fry asked them to help take refugees into Spain. They pretended to be vineyard workers and took people across the mountains on what was called the F route (for Fittko) two or three times a week for seven months. The number of those they helped is sometimes estimated in the hundreds; not one was caught, they said.         The Fittkos eventually escaped to Cuba, then went on to Chicago, where Ms. Fittko's brother lived. Mr. Fittko died in 1960, and Ms. Fittko left no immediate survivors.         She returned to Spain several times to look for Mr. Benjamin's lost briefcase, but never found it.         Correction:  March 22, 2005, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Lisa Fittko, the anti-Hitler activist, misspelled the surname of the French essayist who helped hide the writings of Walter Benjamin, the German literary critic and philosopher. He was Georges Bataille, not Batailles.       
         Leona Rostenberg, a rare-book scholar and dealer who with her partner of 50 years, Madeleine B. Stern, discovered a series of racy novels written by Louisa May Alcott under a pseudonym, died on March 17 at her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Rostenberg died after having heart problems for two years, said Abbey Lustgarten, a filmmaker who became friends with the two women while making a documentary about them.         The discovery in 1942 of the works by Alcott, all written before she gained fame as the author of ''Little Women,'' brought a moment of detective-work thrill for Ms. Rostenberg and her partner and forever altered Alcott scholarship.         A past president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America, Ms. Rostenberg wrote numerous books herself: scholarly works on printing history, and memoirs written with Ms. Stern that twinned their love of literary sleuthing with reminiscences of their life together.         Ms. Rostenberg's relationship with Ms. Stern, whom she met in 1930 and with whom she lived for nearly 50 years, runs like a constant thread through her decades in the world of rare books.         Writing in The New York Times in 1995, Dinitia Smith described the partnership as ''both a love story and a detective story, a tale of doggedness and devotion to books and to each other.''         That article led an editor to approach the women about doing a memoir of their lives; they had already written several books together about their profession and their experiences hunting down this or that volume. The result was ''Old Books, Rare Friends: Two Literary Sleuths and Their Shared Passion'' (Doubleday, 1997).         In it they evaluated their own relationship on Page 3. Referring to the article in The Times, they wrote: ''Several readers inferred from it that our relationship was a lesbian one. This was a misconception. The 'deep, deep love' that existed and exists between us and that is mentioned in Dinitia Smith's last paragraph has no bearing upon sex.''         The follow-up work, ''Bookends: Two Women, One Enduring Friendship'' (Free Press, 2001), focused even more on their relationship and intertwined personal lives, including a chapter called ''Men We Did Not Marry.''         Leona Rostenberg was born in the Bronx on December 28, 1908, to Dr. Adolph and Louisa D. Rostenberg. Her father was a dermatologist. She met Ms. Stern in 1930 while she was a senior at New York University and Ms. Stern was a freshman at Barnard.         Ms. Stern lent Ms. Rostenberg $1,000 to start her rare-book business and eventually joined her as partner. They lived first in Ms. Rostenberg's family house in the Bronx, and then in Manhattan.         They made their discovery about Louisa May Alcott after being tipped off by a scholar that she might have written works under a pseudonym to pay the rent, but that the pseudonym was mystery.         After seeing a reference to an ''A.M. Barnard'' in a correspondence between Alcott and a publisher, they knew they had found what -- or whom -- they had been looking for.         The discovery caused a re-evaluation of Alcott's career. Eventually, one of the lost Alcott works, ''A Long Fatal Love Chase,'' was published.         ''It completely changed the way people perceived Louisa May Alcott,'' Ms. Lustgarten said. ''What they knew about was 'Little Women,' and here were 'blood and thunder' tales -- meetings in opium dens and things like that. The polar opposite of 'Little Women' in the sense of being more risqué and passionate.''         Ms. Rostenberg is survived by two cousins, Richard F. Koch and Marion Alexander.       
         Katherine A. Lathrop, a pioneering researcher in nuclear medicine and a member of a University of Chicago team that developed an isotope widely used to locate and diagnose cancers, died on March 10 at a nursing home in Las Cruces, N.M. She was 89.         The cause was advanced dementia, her family said.         A versatile scientist with degrees in biology, chemistry and physics, Ms. Lathrop was named a professor of radiology at Chicago, where she taught for four decades, without having received a doctorate.         In 1945 and 1946, she participated in the Manhattan Project as a junior chemist in the metallurgical laboratory in Chicago, studying the effects of radioactive materials on animals. Later, as part of a research effort led by Dr. Paul V. Harper, she investigated the qualities of technetium, a radioactive element discovered in the 1930's.         Ms. Lathrop and the Chicago team experimented with an isotope, technetium 99m, by injecting it into a patient's bloodstream and then tracing its path through the brain, heart, kidney, liver and other organs.         A scan of the isotope, also called a radionuclide or radiotracer, yielded images to help diagnose and record the size and growth of cancers and other tumors. Dr. Harper's team also found technetium was less radioactive and had a shorter half-life than many other isotopes, and was therefore less dangerous to patients. A scanning system for technetium was perfected in 1963 and was used to perform a successful brain scan. The isotope remains in clinical use worldwide and is often used to scan bones.         Dr. Robert Beck, an emeritus professor of radiology at Chicago and a member of Dr. Harper's team, recalled that Ms. Lathrop was ''an indispensable part of Paul Harper's team.''         Dr. Beck added, ''After that initial successful scan, the field of nuclear medicine took a major and continuing upward turn.''         Katherine Gray Austin was born in Lawton, Okla. She graduated from Oklahoma State University, where she also received a master's degree in chemistry in 1939.         Ms. Lathrop was appointed an associate biochemist at the Argonne National Laboratory, where she worked from 1947 to 1954. She next joined the staff of the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital, now the Franklin McLean Memorial Research Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Chicago. In 1978, she was appointed professor of radiology at Chicago, a position she held until retiring in 1985.         Ms. Lathrop served as chairwoman of the Society of Nuclear Medicine's Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee from 1977 to 1984.         Ms. Lathrop lived in Hyde Park, Ill., before moving to Las Cruces last year.         She is survived by a son, Dr. David Lathrop, a physiologist at the National Institutes of Health, of Gaithersburg, Md.; three daughters, Laura Fowler of Santa Fe, N.M., Jane Grider of Las Cruces and Julia Smiddy of Valparaiso, Ind.; a sister, Billie Carol Austin of Denver; a brother, John C. Austin of Duncan, Okla.; 10 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Teresa Wright, the high-minded ingénue who marshaled intelligence and spunk to avoid being typecast as another 1940's ''sweater girl'' and became the only actor to be nominated for Academy Awards for her first three films, died on Sunday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, her daughter, Mary-Kelly Busch, said.         Miss Wright had many parts on Broadway and once performed at a White House dinner for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but her meteoric landing in Hollywood in 1941 is the stuff of legend.         After seeing her on Broadway, Samuel Goldwyn, the legendary producer, asked her to play the role of Bette Davis's daughter in ''The Little Foxes'' in 1941. Her performance in the film moved its director, William Wyler, to tell The New York Times that she was the most promising young actress he had ever directed.         She proved his point by being nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress for the picture. The next year, she was nominated for best actress for her next role, opposite Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig's wife in ''The Pride of the Yankees,'' and won the Oscar for best supporting actress as the love interest of Greer Garson's war-bound son in ''Mrs. Miniver.''         Her work included a starring role in Wyler's ''Best Years of Our Lives,'' winner of the best-picture Oscar in 1946; playing opposite Marlon Brando in his first movie, ''The Men,'' in 1950; and creating the character of Charlie, the innocent but suspicious niece of a serial killer, in Alfred Hitchcock's harrowing ''Shadow of a Doubt'' in 1943.         After the 1950's, she drifted away from movies and worked on the stage in roles like Linda Loman opposite George C. Scott's Willy in a 1975 Broadway production of ''Death of a Salesman.'' She was nominated for three Emmy Awards for her dramatic roles on television and in 1997 appeared in a cinematic adaptation of John Grisham's ''Rainmaker.''         For all her allure as the fetching ''girl next door,'' Miss Wright fiercely fought not to be a glamour girl. She loathed pictures in bathing suits and interviews with fan magazines, and told Goldwyn as much. He assured her he was not of ''the bathing suit school of Hollywood producers,'' according to The Times in 1942, and promised to promote her more ethereal talents.         ''There would be no leg art, no whispered romances for the columnists, no orchid and ermine setting for her background,'' her contract stipulated, according to The Times.         But Miss Wright's disregard for Hollywood's demands eventually caused Goldwyn to terminate her contract, in 1948. In their highly publicized exchange, he said she was lax in publicizing her pictures. She said movies had become too brazenly commercial.         ''I was going to be Joan of Arc,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1969, ''and all I proved was that I was an actress who would work for less money.''         For her next picture, ''The Men,'' instead of the $125,000 she had once commanded, she received $20,000, but her co-star was Marlon Brando.         Muriel Teresa Wright was born on Oct. 27, 1918, in Manhattan. She dropped her first named in her early 20's when she found another Muriel Wright was already registered with Actors' Equity.         Her parents separated soon after she was born, and her father, an insurance salesman, farmed her out to various relatives in New York and New Jersey. She did not start school until she was 8, and did not graduate from high school in Maplewood, N.J., until she was almost 20.         She was inspired to become an actress by seeing Helen Hayes in ''Victoria Regina'' on Broadway while still a student. She played leading parts in high school plays, but a teacher told her to stick with typing.         Another teacher helped her get a scholarship to the Wharf Theater in Provincetown, Mass., the summer of her junior year. That led to summer stock work, an understudy role on Broadway in ''Our Town'' and, in 1939, the part of Mary in ''Life With Father,'' based on the memoirs of Clarence Day. After seeing it, Goldwyn went backstage to hire her.         Miss Wright was married for 10 years to Niven Busch, a screenwriter and novelist. She married the playwright Robert Anderson in 1959, and they divorced in the early 1970's. Ms. Busch, Miss Wright's daughter, said the two remained close.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Clinton, Conn., Miss Wright is survived by her son, Niven Perence Busch of Indianapolis, and two grandchildren.         In 1998, Miss Wright was asked to throw the first pitch at a Yankees game in honor of the anniversary of Lou Gehrig's famous farewell speech to fans in 1939, the climax of ''Pride of the Yankees.'' She said it was her first game. But after years of ignoring baseball, she then became a fervent fan herself, raptly following the Yankees on television and at their stadium.         ''The whole thing is pure theater to me,'' she explained.       
         The Rev. Phyllis Taylor Wofford, who in 1959 was the first woman to become a minister on the staff of Riverside Church in Manhattan, died on April 4 in Norristown, Pa. She was 96. A Pennsylvania resident since 1988, she lived in Lansdale.         Her death was announced by a stepson, former United States Senator Harris Wofford.         Ordained at 50 after a career as a personnel executive in private business, Mrs. Wofford became a full-time minister at the church, doing pastoral work and acting as a liaison officer with other church organizations.         She left in 1963, when her husband, an assistant dean at Columbia University and a church deacon, accepted a post at Robert College in Istanbul.         Phyllis Taylor was born in Norwood, Mass. She grew up in Manchester, N.H., where her father, Herbert, was superintendent of schools, and graduated from Skidmore College in 1930.         She held various jobs before joining the staff of Riverside Church in 1952 to work on women's issues.         When she found herself perplexed by theological questions, Riverside's founding minister, Harry Emerson Fosdick, encouraged her to enroll at the Union Theological Seminary, where she received her Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1959.         She was ordained as a Congregational minister in what is now the United Church of Christ and then became a minister at Riverside, which is interdenominational but affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the Baptist Church .         Mrs. Wofford was active in the hospice movement in Winston-Salem, N.C., in the 1970's until her move to Pennsylvania. Her husband, Harris L. Wofford Sr., died in 1981.         In addition to her stepson, the former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania and now a resident of Washington, Mrs. Wofford is survived by a stepdaughter, Anne Wofford Towson of Shaker Heights, Ohio; another stepson, John G. Wofford of Cambridge, Mass.; 11 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Diane Knippers, a religious strategist who helped conservative Christians raise an increasingly loud and unified voice in the traditionally liberal bastions of mainline Protestantism in recent years, died on Monday in Arlington, Va. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, according to the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a small but influential Washington group, of which Mrs. Knippers, a laywoman, was the longtime president.         The institute is a resource center for conservative members of the mainline denominations -- primarily the Presbyterian, Methodist and Episcopal Churches -- disaffected by their churches' policies, especially on sexuality.         When the Episcopal Church consecrated its first gay bishop in 2003, Mrs. Knippers, a member of the church's Standing Commission on Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations, helped lay the groundwork for a rebellion that threatens to split the church.         Her detractors accused her of exploiting and deepening divisions in churches that need healing. But she said she was merely working to give the silent majority its say in church policy.         ''It's pretty clear that the church elite in the mainline denominations are to the left of the people in the pews,'' she told The New York Times last year.         John Green, a specialist in religion and politics at the University of Akron, credited Mrs. Knippers with changing people's ideas about what it meant to be a Protestant.         ''Prior to her activities, traditionalists within mainline denominations were mostly an afterthought or a footnote,'' he said, ''but she was able to empower them and bring them together.''         The institute shared tips on how a conservative congregation could withhold money from its denomination's headquarters, how to win seats on judicial committees and how to force heresy trials of gay members of the clergy.         Mrs. Knippers also forged new links among traditionalists in the mainline churches, Roman Catholics and the much larger network of evangelical Christians from Baptist and Pentecostal churches.         ''She was able to bring together Catholics, all kinds of Protestants and evangelicals who agree on the essential teachings of historic Christianity,'' said Roberta Ahmanson, a conservative philanthropist and one of the institute's main donors.         Mrs. Knippers urged evangelical Christians to reach across the lines of faith to their Muslim counterparts.         ''There are things we may have in common and on which we could become political and cultural allies,'' she told an interviewer in 2003, ''defending the unborn, upholding marriage, caring for refugees, advocating religious freedom.''         Mrs. Knippers also worked through the institute to raise public awareness of the persecution of Christians in Asia and Africa.         At her death, Mrs. Knippers's influence was still growing. Two months ago, Time magazine named her one of the country's top 25 evangelicals.         Mrs. Knippers was born Diane LeMasters in Rushville, Ind., in 1952, to a Methodist minister and his wife, a schoolteacher. Before earning a master's degree in sociology of religion at the University of Tennessee, she married Edward Knippers, an artist who paints biblical scenes.         After the fall of the Soviet Union, Mrs. Knippers, who became the institute's president in 1992, gave the group its domestic focus, first on radical feminism within the churches, then on homosexuality.         Hers was a level and persuasive voice. Randall Balmer, the head of the religion department at Barnard College, who called her ''one of the essential strategists for the religious right at the turn of the 21st century,'' said she came off like ''a very bright and sophisticated housewife.''         Mrs. Knippers is survived by her husband; her parents, Clarence E. and Vera LeMasters of Lakeland, Fla.; and a brother, Douglas LeMasters, of Fairfax, Va.         She was found to have cancer in 2003 but kept a demanding schedule until recently. Six weeks before her death, she appeared in Washington to promote a book of which she was co-editor, ''Toward an Evangelical Public Policy: Political Strategies for the Health of the Nation.'' While she had lost her speaking voice, Mrs. Knippers delivered a written address on the gap in religious values between Democrats and Republicans that sounded a valedictory note.         ''I'm an evangelical and I am a Republican,'' the statement read. ''But this gap doesn't please me at all because my religious convictions trump my party commitments. I want Christians to be salt and light -- a strong influence -- across the political landscape.''       
         Dale Messick, a pioneering newspaper cartoonist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession by creating Brenda Starr, the glamorous red-haired journalist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession, died on Tuesday in Sonoma County, Calif. She was 98.         She died after a long decline that began with a stroke in 1998, her daughter, Starr Rohrman, told The Associated Press. She had been caring for her mother at her home in Penngrove, Calif.         Ms. Messick was born on April 11, 1906; Brenda Starr was born in June 1940. An impossibly glamorous redhead, her appearance was inspired by Rita Hayworth; her first name came from the most famous debutante of the day, Brenda Frazier, and her last name was chosen because she was the star reporter on The Flash.         The Brenda Starr comic strip was a symphony of décolletage, good legs precariously balanced on high-heeled shoes, and Dior-like clothing that no woman would be likely to wear to a newspaper office.         During the war she was an ace reporter, chasing spies and other malefactors in cities and in jungles, fighting off sharks, giant squids and other ravenous animals, but selling war bonds, too. Her red hair was always attractively coiffed; her eyes always glistened with tiny starbursts.         She found time for romance with her mystery man, Basil St. John, a lean, square-jawed hunk who wore an eye patch and whose only other defect was that he was dying of an exotic disease. This frequently sent him to the jungle in search of a rare black orchid whose serum gave him temporary respite. While he was away, Brenda had more suitors than Penelope, but she remained loyal to her true love. Brenda finally married Basil in 1976, whereupon he vanished again on another orchid hunt.         As for Ms. Messick, she was married twice, to Everett George and Oscar Strom, and both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, from her first marriage, and two grandchildren.         Of her heroine's profession, she once explained, ''She was already a reporter when the strip started, but she was sick and tired of covering nothing but ice-cream socials. She wanted a job with action, like the men reporters had.''         But Ms. Messick knew little about the newspaper business and refused to learn about it, saying it might spoil her imagination.         ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'' was sometimes criticized by journalists for its outlandish depiction of their profession. In one strip, Brenda brings a typed story to The Flash late at night and hands it to a custodian, who somehow gets it into the next day's paper. On another occasion, she finds herself in an airplane she cannot fly, so she parachutes to safety, somehow landing in front of her editor's window.         And, in perhaps the greatest breach of authenticity, she talks back to her managing editor.         Ms. Messick hired other people to draw cars and other mechanical contraptions, animals and nature scenes. But for four decades, only she drew Brenda Starr's face and body.         Dalia Messick, born in South Bend, Ind., spent two years in the third grade and two years in the eighth grade and did not get her high school diploma until she was 20, and then only at the urging of her parents, Cephas Messick, a sign painter and vocational arts teacher, and Bertha Messick, a milliner; her work inspired some of Brenda's fetching hats.         Ms. Messick changed her name to Dale after she encountered discrimination against women entering the newspaper cartooning business. She told Norma Lee Browning of The Saturday Evening Post: ''Brenda is the glamorous girl I wished I was. ... She's what most women wish they were and what most men wish their women were, too.''         She originally thought of her character as a girl bandit, but was talked into making her a reporter by an aide to Joseph Medill Patterson, founder and publisher of The Daily News of New York and head of The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate.         Ms. Messick had started drawing comic strips in school. After leaving school, she studied art for a summer in Chicago and worked for greeting card companies there and in New York, continuing to work on her comic strips at night. None were published until ''Brenda Starr'' was accepted by the syndicate.         After Brenda Starr appeared, Ms. Messick dyed her hair red to match Brenda's. ''I am Brenda Starr,'' she would say to interviewers.         ''Brenda Starr'' was twice adapted for the screen, first as a 1945 serial with Joan Woodbury, and later as a feature movie starring Brooke Shields. Shot in 1986, it was not released until 1992, when it opened to dismal notices. Ms. Messick warned everyone she met not to see it.         However, over the years, there were Brenda Starr dolls and even a postage stamp with Brenda's likeness on it, part of a series on 20 classic comic characters.         At its height, ''Brenda Starr'' appeared in 250 papers and is still syndicated by Tribune Media Services. Ms. Messick retired from drawing the strip in the mid-1980's, and it was passed on to other artists, all women. She said she did not like the way later versions of Brenda Starr looked.         In the 1990's, she developed a new comic character called ''Granny Glamour,'' who appeared in a single-panel cartoon in a publication for the elderly in California.         In her 80's, she boasted of juggling three boyfriends simultaneously.         ''All three wouldn't make one good man,'' she told an interviewer, ''but at my age, you can't be too choosy.''       
         Geraldine Stutz, who transformed Henri Bendel from a carriage trade retailer in decline into a chic emporium of designer brands in the 1960's, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 80.         Her death came after a long illness, said her stepdaughter, Emma Turner.         Ms. Stutz is best known for her 29-year career as the president of Henri Bendel, with a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first, installing their collections in elaborately merchandised departments that heralded the introduction of a new generation of fashion stars -- Stephen Burrows, Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, Holly Harp and Ralph Lauren among them.         Many longtime Bendel shoppers recall Ms. Stutz's 1958 overhaul of the main floor at the store, at 10 West 57th Street, into a U-shaped ''Street of Shops'' widely acknowledged as a precursor to modern shop-in-shop merchandising displays. Based on her taste alone, Ms. Stutz divided merchandise into small vitrines of watches, handbags, stockings, and along one side, an inspiring ''Gilded Cage,'' a giant replica of a birdcage that housed the cosmetics department.         ''Geraldine had a vision of the kind of store she wanted to create,'' said Jean Rosenberg, who was the vice president and merchandising director at Bendel's from six months before Ms. Stutz's arrival in 1957 to their joint departure in 1986, after the store was sold to The Limited. ''It was for a particular kind of New York woman, where she could find a uniformity of taste and a certain amount of comfort in a smallish environment, where everything in one store was to her liking.''         Ms. Stutz was born in Chicago on Aug. 5, 1924. She aspired to an acting career and studied drama at Mundelein College before changing her focus to journalism. She moved to New York to be closer to the theater and found work as a fashion editor for movie magazines, and in 1947 was hired as an associate fashion editor for Glamour magazine, where she covered shoes.         Colleagues described Ms. Stutz as an industrious learner who immersed herself in the subject matter. Grace Mirabella, the former editor of Mirabella magazine, recalled an introduction to Ms. Stutz in the early 1950's, when Ms. Mirabella was working at Vogue. ''She loved to talk about the business and what was going on behind the scenes, and she knew everything about shoes,'' Ms. Mirabella said.         Ms. Stutz put her knowledge to practical use when she went to work for several footwear manufacturers, including I. Miller, the company for which Andy Warhol designed advertisements, after it was sold to the conglomerate Genesco. Maxey Jarman, its president, recognized in Ms. Stutz an ability for merchandising and advertising, and named her to run the Henri Bendel store in 1957. ''Jarman had talked to her at great length about her vision for the store,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It was not going to be a store for everybody.''         Bendel's was known at various times as a hat shop and as the source of the Duke of Windsor's wardrobe, but Ms. Stutz's concept was narrowly focused on a young, sophisticated urban woman, and she rarely ordered clothes larger than size 10. In an article in New York magazine in 1987, Ms. Stutz described her taste for what she called ''dog whistle'' fashion: ''clothes with a pitch so high and special that only the thinnest and most sophisticated women would hear their call.'' She was also one of the first retailers to consider merchandising food and furniture alongside fashion, and she made way for the in-store designer boutique in the late 1960's, as she did for Ms. Rykiel.         ''She recognized that fashion was more than just about clothing; it was about lifestyle and how one lives,'' said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who worked under Ms. Stutz from 1967 to 1976. ''She thought to put in perfumed candles and potpourri at the entrances so that when people walked in, they got this wonderful aroma. She was born with impeccable taste, and practically brought over every European designer who ever came to America.''         Ms. Stutz's Street of Shops replaced what was formerly a dimly lit floor with merchandise randomly displayed along a 100-foot corridor. She installed marble floors and boutiques, small shops within the larger store that changed each season, stocked with exclusive merchandise culled from markets around the world -- a flower shop, stationery, a tiny art gallery, tabletop items from Frank MacIntosh, Lee Bailey's home displays, and a boutique called ''Port of Call'' with objects from Vietnam and Thailand.         Ms. Rosenberg recalled her instructions to travel to Paris to explore the new market for ready-to-wear in 1959, when Ms. Stutz told her, ''Buy anything you want.''         ''It was a store that was edited like a magazine,'' Ms. Mirabella said. ''It was everybody's meeting place on Saturdays or at Christmastime.''         Ms. Stutz took the in-store-shop concept further in the late 1960's with boutiques dedicated to the collections of designers she felt could succeed with the store's support. Stephen Burrows opened his boutique there in 1969, an experience he recalled as a defining moment of his career (one he replicated in 2002 at Bendel's current site: 712 Fifth Avenue).         In 1980, Ms. Stutz assembled a team of investors and acquired the store from Genesco. Five years later she sold her interest, and worked as a publisher with Random House, overseeing books on Andy Warhol and Elsie de Wolfe. She also continued to consult with designers and retailers through a practice called GSG Group, which she founded in 1993.         Ms. Stutz's mid-1960's marriage to David Gibbs, an art dealer and painter, ended in divorce, her stepdaughter, Ms. Turner, said.         Robert Rufino, the vice president of creative services at Tiffany & Co., is one of the many retail executives who found their start with Ms. Stutz. He designed windows for the company in the 1970's, and recalled Ms. Stutz's ability to intermingle her interests in art and film with fashion.         ''In those days, there was nothing else like Henri Bendel,'' Mr. Rufino said. ''It was like working for the best house in the world. To take this little town house and make it look like someone lived there, as you were going from room to room -- it was just one woman's vision on the world of fashion, and yet it did incredibly well.''       
         Andrea Dworkin, the feminist writer and antipornography campaigner whose work was a lightning rod for the debate on pornography and censorship that raged through the United States in the 1980's, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 58.         Ms. Dworkin died in her sleep, said her husband, John Stoltenberg. The cause of death had not been determined last night, but Mr. Stoltenberg said that Ms. Dworkin had suffered from several chronic illnesses in recent years.         With her unruly dark curls and denim overalls, Ms. Dworkin was for decades a visible presence on the lecture circuit, at antipornography rallies and ''take back the night'' marches. In speeches and in her many books, she returned vocally, passionately and seldom without controversy to the subjects of sex, sexuality and violence against women, themes that to her were inextricably and painfully linked.         Among her best-known books are ''Pornography: Men Possessing Women'' (Putnam/Perigee, 1981), ''Intercourse'' (Free Press, 1987) and ''Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant'' (Basic Books, 2002).         Reviewing ''Heartbreak'' in The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller wrote: ''Dworkin is one of the few remaining specimens of pure countercultural Romanticism: fierce, melodramatic and utterly convinced that all truth can be found in her own roiling, untempered emotions.''         With her first book, ''Woman Hating'' (Dutton, 1974), Ms. Dworkin drew the lines in what she saw as a pitched battle against men's historical domination of women. She opposed all forms of pornography, which she believed incited violence against women. She was also critical of consensual sex between women and men, which she saw as an act of everyday subjugation in which women were accomplices.         ''One of the differences between marriage and prostitution is that in marriage you only have to make a deal with one man,'' Ms. Dworkin wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone'' (Dutton, 1989). Marriage, she added, ''is a legal license to rape.''         Andrea Rita Dworkin was born on Sept. 26, 1946, in Camden, N.J., and earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Bennington College in 1968. She later moved to Europe, where she married a Dutch political radical. The marriage was abusive, Ms. Dworkin said later, and she was divorced after three years.         ''I was a battered wife,'' she told The New York Times in 1985, ''and pornography entered into it. Both of us read it, and it helped give me the wrong idea of what a woman was supposed to be for a man.''         To Ms. Dworkin, it did not matter that some critics condemned her sweeping antipornography stance as a form of censorship. With the feminist lawyer Catharine A. MacKinnon, she wrote a municipal ordinance, briefly adopted by several cities in the 1980's, that defined pornography as a form of sex discrimination. (In 1986, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's ruling overturning the ordinance in Indianapolis.)         If Ms. Dworkin's work was unabashedly polemical, her life was full of nuanced contradictions. She publicly identified herself as a lesbian, speaking movingly about ''this love of women'' as ''the soil in which my life is rooted,'' and her work was a touchstone for many gay men and women. But in 1998, she married Mr. Stoltenberg, her companion of many years. A writer, editor and a founder of Men Against Pornography who also identifies himself as gay, Mr. Stoltenberg is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Dworkin's other books include ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation'' (Free Press, 2000), ''Right-Wing Women'' (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1983) and, with Ms. MacKinnon, ''Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality'' (Organizing Against Pornography, 1988). Ms. Dworkin also wrote two novels, ''Mercy'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1991), about serial rape, and ''Ice and Fire'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), about prostitution.         Though some critics dismissed her work as unreasoned diatribe, Ms. Dworkin remained an outspoken champion of the causes in which she believed.         ''I am not afraid of confrontation or risk,'' she wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone,'' ''also not of arrogance or error.''       
         Betty Talmadge, a former first lady of Georgia and a prominent Washington hostess who had a second career as a businesswoman, restaurateur and cookbook author after her divorce from Senator Herman E. Talmadge, died on Saturday in Atlanta. She was 81.         Mrs. Talmadge died after a long illness, her son, Gene, said.         Mrs. Talmadge was married to Mr. Talmadge, a Democrat and the scion of a powerful Georgia political family, from 1941 until their divorce in 1977. A former Georgia governor who served four terms in the United States Senate, from 1957 to 1981, Mr. Talmadge died in 2002.         In 1979, Mrs. Talmadge testified before the Senate Select Committee on Ethics against her former husband, who was accused of improperly using campaign and office money.         As Georgia's first lady in the 1940's and 50's, Mrs. Talmadge was known for her lavish parties filled with antebellum charm. At the Talmadge family plantation in Lovejoy, Ga., 25 miles south of Atlanta, partygoers might be greeted by soldiers dressed in Confederate gray, Dixieland banjo players and the family pets, among them Rabbit E. Lee and a donkey named Assley Wilkes. In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Talmadge was a frequent bridge partner of Lady Bird Johnson.         She also ran a prosperous country ham business and in later years operated a restaurant out of her home. She wrote two cookbooks, ''How to Cook a Pig & Other Back-to-the-Farm Recipes'' (Simon & Schuster, 1977), with Jean Robitscher and Carolyn Carter; and ''Betty Talmadge's Lovejoy Plantation Cookbook'' (Peachtree Publishers, 1983).         Leila Elizabeth Shingler was born in Ashburn, Ga., on Sept. 17, 1923, and married Mr. Talmadge at 18. In 1947, at 24, she became Georgia's first lady for 67 days after Mr. Talmadge briefly succeeded his father, Gov. Eugene Talmadge, who had died after being re-elected but before being sworn in. Herman Talmadge was later officially appointed to fill out his father's term through 1948, when he won a special election; he went on to win a full four-year term as governor in 1950.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Talmadge and her husband started Talmadge Farms, which cured hams. She built the company into a $6 million business before selling it in 1969.         At the end of 1976, Mrs. Talmadge learned from a television news report that her husband had filed for divorce.         In 1978, she ran in the Democratic primary for the House seat in Georgia's Sixth District. She lost the primary; Newt Gingrich, a Republican, won the general election.         In the summer of 1979, Mrs. Talmadge, who said she was testifying reluctantly, told the Senate Ethics Committee about tens of thousands of dollars in cash that her former husband kept in an overcoat in the closet of their Washington condominium. Although Mrs. Talmadge did not specify how the cash got into the coat, she testified that she and her husband had dipped into it for years whenever they needed extra money. She said she used the cash to supplement the $50 weekly allowance from her millionaire husband.         In October, the Senate voted to denounce Senator Talmadge for ''reprehensible'' official finances. He lost his bid for a fifth term in 1980.         Besides her son, of Lovejoy, Mrs. Talmadge is survived by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Another son, Robert, died in 1975.         After her first cookbook appeared, The New York Times asked Mrs. Talmadge how she had found the nerve to slaughter her first pig.         ''Real easy, honey,'' she replied. ''I just thought, 'You little male chauvinist, you,' and I went to it.''       
         Ruth Laredo, a pianist equally at home in chamber music and solo works who was known for landmark recordings of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, died on Wednesday at her apartment in New York. She was 67.         Ms. Laredo, who played her last concert on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had cancer and died in her sleep, said her manager, James Murtha.         The concert was one of a series she had given for 17 years at the Met called ''Concerts With Commentary,'' in which Ms. Laredo played and spoke engagingly about music. The series had become an important part of the New York concert scene, where she was a frequent presence.         Just two days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Ms. Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Alice Tully Hall debut with a recital there. It was the opening concert of the 2001 Lincoln Center season, and Ms. Laredo addressed the audience beforehand, saying: ''It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.''         Ms. Laredo was a pianist in the Romantic mold, a dynamic performer concerned with texture and color. In recent years, Mr. Murtha said, her career as a soloist with orchestras had waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals, chamber concerts and accompanying duties.         When she was first on the rise, in the 1970's, Ms. Laredo was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others -- Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example.         ''Every time we did interviews in those early days, she was asked how does it feel to be a woman pianist,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''She wanted to be a pianist, period.''         Ruth Meckler was born in Detroit on Nov. 20, 1937. She attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin. She graduated in 1960 and that same year married the violinist Jaime Laredo, with whom she collaborated musically. They later divorced. Ms. Laredo is survived by their daughter, Jennifer Laredo, who lives in London with her husband, the cellist Paul Watkins, and by a granddaughter.         Ms. Laredo made her debut with an orchestra in 1962, in a program led by Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, 12 years later. Her Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came only in 1981.         At Curtis, Serkin schooled her in the basics of Mozart and Beethoven, turning a disapproving eye on her youthful love for Rachmaninoff. But it was with his music, as well as that of his fellow Russian Scriabin, that she made her mark.         In the 1970's she recorded two pioneering and acclaimed sets: the entire Scriabin piano sonatas, for the now-defunct Connoisseur label, and the complete solo repertory of Rachmaninoff, on seven LP's for CBS Masterworks.         When Ms. Laredo went to Serkin to ask if he thought she could handle the Rachmaninoff, he gave his blessing. '''You must do it' was the answer he gave me,'' Ms. Laredo said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times.         But preparing for the recordings was a fearsome and wearing task. ''I had to learn the many, many Rachmaninoff pieces that no one plays, and I found out why no one does,'' she said. ''It's because they're so hard.'' She later channeled her love for Rachmaninoff into scholarship, preparing a new edition of his piano preludes for the C.F. Peters music publisher.         The Scriabin LP's came when little of his music was available on record, and they helped spark a surge of his popularity in the United States. Ms. Laredo said that she first heard his music at a concert of Vladimir Horowitz and was dazzled.         Bernard Holland, a Times music critic, wrote of her playing of Scriabin's music: ''Ms. Laredo's sensuous, beautifully controlled playing caught its mad and slightly evil quality.''         Correction:  June 17, 2005, Friday  An obituary of the classical pianist Ruth Laredo on May 27 referred imprecisely to the label that issued her recordings of the Scriabin piano sonatas in 1970. It is Connoisseur Society, not Connoisseur, and it remains in business.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Lillian Lux, the matriarch of a celebrated Yiddish theatrical family who performed for decades as an actress and singer in New York and around the world, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her son, Mike Burstyn, said.         With her husband, Pesach Burstein, Ms. Lux starred inYiddish-language plays and musicals from the 1930's on. Among her most famous roles was Feygele in the operetta ''A Khasene in Shtetl'' (''A Village Wedding''), which she played opposite her husband. In later years, the couple performed with their two children as the Four Bursteins.         The family was the subject of a documentary, ''The Komediant,'' shown in the United States in 2002. Directed by Arnon Goldfinger, an Israeli filmmaker, the film is narrated by Ms. Lux.         The first decades of the 20th century were the glory days of the Yiddish stage, with more than a dozen theaters in New York City alone. To their devoted fans, who packed the seats for original productions and adaptations of the classics, Ms. Lux and Mr. Burstein were the Lunt and Fontanne of the Lower East Side.         In the late 1940's Ms. Lux had her own Yiddish-language radio show on WEVD-AM. But by the 1950's, with theatergoers graying and many American Jews assimilating, Yiddish theater began to disappear. By the 1970's, it was almost completely gone. ''The Komediant'' chronicles the family's peripatetic existence as they travel to Europe, South America and Israel in pursuit of an ever more elusive audience.         Lillian Sylvia Lukashefsky was born in Brooklyn on June 20, 1918; her family Americanized its surname when she was young. She began her stage training as a child with the Yiddish Art Theater, run by the impresario Maurice Schwartz. As a teenager, she played the Catskills, performing opposite Danny Kaye.         At 17 Ms. Lux met Mr. Burstein, more than 20 years her senior and an established star. He was looking for an actress for his South American tour. After making the requisite good impression on Ms. Lux's parents, he hired her. They set sail and were married in Uruguay in 1938.         In the late 1930's, the couple toured Poland, catching the last ship out before the Nazis invaded in September 1939. After the war, they returned to Europe. Little of their audience remained. In the 1950's, the Bursteins went to Israel but found it difficult for Yiddish theater to take root there. They had better success a decade later, when they returned with ''The Megilla of Itzik Manger.'' The show, a musical version of the Book of Esther starring Ms. Lux, her husband and son, came to Broadway in a Yiddish-English production in 1968.         After her husband's death in 1986, Ms. Lux performed in a one-woman show and appeared often on radio.         Besides her son, of Los Angeles (an actor on Broadway and in films, Mr. Burstyn changed the spelling of his name as an adult), Ms. Lux is survived by a daughter, Susan Roth of Westfield, N.J.; and a sister, Beatrice Friedman of Washington.       
         Jane Benedict, a prominent housing advocate who was the principal founder of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a New York City tenants' rights organization, died on Saturday in Berkeley, Calif. She was 93. A longtime resident of New York, she had lived in Oakland, Calif., for the last several years.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son, Jim Hawley.         A former trade unionist, Ms. Benedict was active in housing issues for four decades. She helped found the Metropolitan Council in 1958 and was its chairwoman for many years. Among issues concerning the council are rent regulation, protection from unlawful eviction and creating affordable public housing.         Jane Wiley Benedict was born in Manhattan on Nov. 10, 1911. She attended Connecticut College for Women for two years before transferring to Cornell, where she received a bachelor's degree in English in 1933. After graduating, she returned to New York City, going to work in the book department of Macy's.         Through her job, Ms. Benedict became involved in the Book and Magazine Guild, a trade union. She was later an organizer for the union's parent, the United Office and Professional Workers of America.         Ms. Benedict became involved with housing in the early 1950's when she lived in the Yorkville section of Manhattan. In those years, many of the neighborhood's prewar tenements were being razed for luxury high-rise apartment buildings, displacing tens of thousands of low-and middle-income residents.         In response, Ms. Benedict started the Yorkville Save Our Homes Committee, which lobbied for the construction of low-cost, racially integrated public housing. The committee later joined forces with other New York tenants' groups to form the Metropolitan Council, a citywide organization.         In 1982 Ms. Benedict ran for governor as a member of the Unity Party, a coalition of community, labor and tenants' groups.         Ms. Benedict's first marriage ended in divorce. Her second husband, Peter Hawley, a union organizer whom she married in 1942, died in 1996. Besides her son, of Oakland, Ms. Benedict is survived by a daughter, Ellen Hawley, of Minneapolis; two grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.       
         Mary T. Washington, a bookkeeper who in the 1920's began methodically surmounting racial barriers in business to become the first African-American woman to be a certified public accountant and the head of one of the largest black-owned accounting firms in the nation, died on July 2 at a nursing home in Chicago. She was 99.         Her death was reported by her daughter, Barbara Shepherd.         Ms. Washington began her career after high school in the 1920's at Binga State Bank, one of the nation's largest black-owned banks.         She worked at the bank as an assistant to the cashier and vice president, Arthur Wilson.         When virtually no white C.P.A.'s would hire blacks, Mr. Wilson provided Ms. Washington with the requisite experience, according to an account written by Theresa A. Hammond, who is the chairman of the accounting department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.         In 2002, Dr. Hammond published a book on the history of black C.P.A.'s, ''A White-Collar Profession: African-American Certified Public Accountants Since 1921,'' which included Ms. Washington's career and influence.         Inspired by Mr. Wilson, Ms. Washington earned her bachelor's degree in business from Northwestern University in 1941. While a student, she opened her own accounting firm in her basement, recruiting black businesses as clients.         Her husband, Donald Melvin Wylie, a mechanic for Yellow Cab, would cook late-night dinners for the group of ambitious young black men who worked for her during the tax season.         Her first business partner, Hiram Pittman, once described it as an ''Underground Railroad'' for aspiring black C.P.A.'s, who came from across the country to work there because they needed the experience to earn the accounting credential.         A study by the National Association of Black Accountants found that in 1943 Ms. Washington became the first black woman to become a C.P.A. and the 13th black C.P.A. in the country, Dr. Hammond said.         With Mr. Pittman and Lester McKeever, she founded Washington, Pittman & McKeever in 1968, still one of the largest black C.P.A. firms. She retired from the firm in 1985 at age 79.         Mary Thelma Morrison was born in Vicksburg, Miss., on April 21, 1906, to Daisy and William Morrison, a carpenter, who boasted to friends that his young daughter could read the entire newspaper.         When she was 6, her mother died, and she went to Chicago to live with her maternal grandparents. She attended Wendell Phillips High School, where she excelled in math.         Her first marriage, to Seymour Washington, ended in divorce.         Besides Ms. Shepherd, Ms. Washington is survived by two sons, Donald Wylie Jr. of Chicago and Donald Wylie II of Los Angeles; two other daughters, Melanie Blanks of Chicago and Ardelia Smith of Chicago; and nine grandchildren.       
         Barbara Bel Geddes, a critically acclaimed stage, screen and television actress known for her work with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950's and, more recently, for her role as Miss Ellie, the matriarch of the fractious Ewing clan on the long-running nighttime soap opera ''Dallas,'' died on Monday at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 82.         The Jordan-Fernald Funeral Home in Mount Desert, Me., confirmed the death to The Associated Press, giving no cause. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Ms. Bel Geddes had died of lung cancer.         On Broadway Ms. Bel Geddes was best known as the original Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on Hot Tin Roof,'' which opened in 1955. She also appeared in ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1951) and ''Silent Night, Lonely Night'' (1959). Her film credits include Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' (1958); ''Caught'' (1949), directed by Max Ophüls; and ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), directed by Elia Kazan.         On television Ms. Bel Geddes starred in several episodes of Hitchcock's weekly series ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1980 she won the Emmy Award for best actress in a dramatic series for her role on ''Dallas.''         Blond, soft-spoken and slightly plump as a young woman, Ms. Bel Geddes projected a resolute, even steely, intelligence beneath her cherubic exterior. It was a quality Hitchcock used to great effect, notably in ''Vertigo,'' in which Ms. Bel Geddes played Midge, the steadfast, unglamorous ex-fiancée of Jimmy Stewart, who watches his painful descent into obsession and madness.         Hitchcock used her memorably again in ''Lamb to the Slaughter,'' widely considered one of the finest episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' Broadcast in the spring of 1958, it starred Ms. Bel Geddes as a wife who murders her philandering husband by bludgeoning him with a frozen leg of lamb. When detectives show up to investigate the death, the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. Ms. Bel Geddes, smiling a tiny, knowing smile, sits them down to a home-cooked meal.         Barbara Bel Geddes was born in New York on Oct. 31, 1922. Her father was Norman Bel Geddes, the architect and stage designer. She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the forgettable play ''Out of the Frying Pan.'' She went on to win a Theater World Award in 1946 for her performance in ''Deep Are the Roots,'' which Kazan directed.         Soon afterward, Ms. Bel Geddes went to Hollywood, where she starred opposite Henry Fonda in her first film, ''The Long Night'' (1947). Although she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Katrin Hanson, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948), Ms. Bel Geddes made relatively few movies, working primarily in theater and television. Her other film credits include ''Blood on the Moon'' (1948), ''Fourteen Hours'' (1951) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).         Ms. Bel Geddes's greatest critical acclaim came as Maggie, the restless young wife in a decaying family of Mississippi planters in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it ''vital, lovely and frank.''         Her other Broadway credits include ''The Living Room'' (1954), by Graham Greene; ''The Sleeping Prince'' (1956), by Terence Rattigan; and ''Mary, Mary'' (1961), by Jean Kerr.         Ms. Bel Geddes appeared on ''Dallas'' in two installments, the first from 1978 to 1984, when she retired after heart surgery. She was replaced as Miss Ellie by Donna Reed, who sued to retain the role after the show's producers reinstated Ms. Bel Geddes in 1985. Ms. Reed lost her bid, and Ms. Bel Geddes remained in the role until 2000.         Ms. Bel Geddes's first marriage, to Carl Schreuer, an engineer, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Windsor Lewis, a theater director, died before her. She is survived by a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage, and a daughter, Betsy, from her second.         In addition to acting, Ms. Bel Geddes also worked as a professional artist. She wrote and illustrated two children's books, ''I Like to Be Me'' (Viking, 1963) and ''So Do I'' (Arbor House, 1972).         Looking back on her career, Ms. Bel Geddes expressed amusement that she was so often cast as patricians. ''They're always making me play well-bred ladies,'' she told People magazine in 1982. She added, ''I'm not very well bred, and I'm not much of a lady.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Barbara Bel Geddes on Thursday misstated the year of her final appearance on the television show ''Dallas.'' It was 1990, not 2000. A picture caption referred incorrectly to the character she played. It was Miss Ellie, not Ms. Ellie.       
         Judith Rossner, a novelist who used crisp, piercing prose to tell of women pushed to often grotesque extremes, most famously in her 1975 book ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was not immediately determined, Rayner Pike, her brother-in-law, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Rossner marshaled intriguing plot twists, precise description and deep empathy to examine women's experiences, addressing situations like pregnancy, sex with strangers and the introduction of a man into a single-parent household.         ''Many of her novels offer a clinical dissection of America's failed marriages and of a culture that has not permitted women to have a life apart from their children and husband,'' said the reference book Contemporary Novelists.         ''Mr. Goodbar,'' the fourth of Ms. Rossner's 10 novels, sold four million copies and in 1977 became a popular movie starring Diane Keaton. The book was based loosely on the 1973 murder of a young schoolteacher in New York who frequented singles bars and could be read as a particularly harrowing caution for the sexually adventurous.         Her seventh novel, ''August,'' published in 1983, was also a best seller. It is about of the complex relationship between a troubled teenager and her psychiatrist, with much of the story told in what seem like transcripts of analytic sessions.         Ms. Rossner's vivid imagination is suggested by the circumstances of the young analysand: Dawn Henley was raised by a lesbian aunt and her lover after Dawn's mother killed herself and her homosexual father drowned in a boating accident. Her foster parents have since separated.         Other fanciful plots include a woman who falls in love with a young man who turns out to be her illegitimate son in ''Emmeline'' (1980), and conjoined twins who marry two women in ''Attachments'' (1977), with the curiosity-inspiring sexual gymnastics hardly ignored.         John Leonard in The New York Times called ''Attachments'' an ''ambitious, disturbing novel by a best-selling author who might have written a trashy book, but decided instead to mess up our minds.''         Judith Perelman was born in Manhattan on March 31, 1935, and grew up in the Bronx. Her father was a textile merchant and her mother a schoolteacher who nurtured her daughter's early interest in writing. At 19 she dropped out of the City College of New York to marry Robert Rossner, a teacher and writer whose name she kept after their divorce in 1972.         She later married and divorced Mordecai Persky. She is survived by her husband Stanley Leff; her children, Daniel and Jean Rossner; her sister, Nancy Pike; and three grandchildren.         Her first marriage broke up after an ill-fated move to a New Hampshire commune, and she returned to New York, where she supported her family with secretarial work, carving out time to write her first three novels. These included ''Any Minute I Can Split,'' finished just before her first divorce.         ''My abiding theme is separations,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1983.         Ms. Rossner became fascinated by the murder of Roseann Quinn, the 27-year-old schoolteacher killed after an encounter in a singles bar, and proposed an article for a special women's issue of Esquire magazine. Esquire's lawyers, fearing the article might jeopardize the accused man's defense, killed the story.         Ms. Rossner, who was recovering from a car accident, found herself pondering the extent to which people are to blame for their own misfortunes. She wrote a one-sentence proposal for a novel on the episode to Simon & Schuster. It read: ''I want to write a book about a schoolteacher who's murdered picking up someone when she's cruising a singles bar.''         According to some published reports, she received a $5,000 advance; others say $10,000. ''Mr. Goodbar'' was sold for $300,000 as a paperback and for $250,000 as a movie, making her financially independent.         Christopher Hawtree, writing in The Guardian of London in 1990, described the book's bleak theme: ''Some of the raunchiest sex scenes ever written lead to a despair that makes death almost inevitable, perhaps even sought.''         Ms. Rossner's other books included ''To the Precipice'' (1966), ''Nine Months in the Life of an Old Maid'' (1969), ''His Little Women'' (1990), ''Olivia'' (1994) and ''Perfidia'' (1997).         Her works repeatedly explored but never explained what she considered an unsettling quandary.         ''It's astonishing what some women will put up with just to have a warm body -- some of the brightest women I know are obsessed with that search,'' she told The Washington Post. ''It's very sad.''       
         Nell I. Mondy, a Cornell biochemist who extolled the nutritional benefits of the potato to consumers worldwide and pushed hard to dispel its reputation as a weighty clump of empty calories, died on Aug. 25 at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 83.         The cause was complications after an operation, said a friend, Marion Howe.         After early research in vitamins, Dr. Mondy became passionate about potatoes in the 1950's, drawn by their nutritional richness, low cost and long life in storage.         In her four decades at Cornell, she compared the taste of different varieties, examined color changes in potatoes and continually promoted their value as a staple food providing amino acids, protein, calcium, vitamin C, iron and other nutrients. In fact, Dr. Mondy said that meals of potatoes and milk provided enough nutrition for a healthy diet.         Dr. Robert L. Plaisted, an emeritus professor of plant breeding at Cornell, said that Dr. Mondy tested big king, Atlantic, Katahdin and other potato varieties, and investigated why some varieties darkened after cooking, a trait considered undesirable by consumers. She also assembled panels of potato tasters to better define the subtleties of different varieties, and then tried to explain differences on a biochemical basis.         In 1987, Dr. Mondy's research created a public stir when she and a graduate student, Barry Gosselin, released a study suggesting that a naturally occurring toxic compound found in potatoes could be hazardous to human health.         The compounds, called glycoalkaloids, become concentrated in the potato skin, especially when exposed to light, but enormous quantities would have to be eaten to result in harm. Regardless, Dr. Mondy recommended removing the skins.         In the 1990's, she reported other potential health hazards from potato skins. Dr. Mondy and others found that chemicals sprayed on potatoes to prevent sprouting in storage often arrived at the grocery store in significantly higher levels than federal guidelines recommended.         She also promoted potatoes as a crop for developing countries, particularly in Africa.         Nell Irene Mondy was born in Pocahontas, Ark. She earned an undergraduate degree from Ouachita Baptist College and a master's degree from the University of Texas. In 1953, Cornell awarded her a doctorate in biochemistry.         Dr. Mondy was appointed an associate professor of food and nutrition at Cornell in 1953, and became a professor there in 1961. While at Cornell, she was a consultant to Frito-Lay, Procter & Gamble and other food companies before retiring in 1992.         She wrote an autobiography, ''You Never Fail Until You Stop Trying: The Story of a Pioneer Woman Chemist,'' in 2001.         She lived in Ithaca.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Franzi Groszmann, who was believed to be among the last survivors of the parents who put their London-bound children on trains to escape Nazi persecution, in the famed Kindertransport, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 100.         Deborah Oppenheimer, producer of the 2000 movie ''Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport,'' announced the death.         Ms. Oppenheimer, whose own mother was a Kindertransport child, said she believed that Mrs. Groszmann was the last surviving mother who had placed a child (the author Lore Segal) on a train from Germany, Austria or Czechoslovakia to seek safety in Britain.         The British government had eased immigration restrictions for children under 17 after the violent attack on Jews in Germany in November 1938 known as Kristallnacht, or Night of the Broken Glass.         ''In no time, the suitcase was gone, the child was gone, the other children were gone -- just emptiness,'' Mrs. Groszmann said in the film about watching Lore board the train in Vienna. ''I did not talk. It was awful.''         She relaxed only after she received a postcard from Lore in England saying she was safe.         Ms. Segal told about the Kindertransport (Children's Transport) in her autobiographical novel, ''Other People's Houses,'' drawing a loving portrait of a charming and capable mother. From Dec. 2, 1938, until May 14, 1940, 9,000 to 10,000 children, 7,500 of them Jewish, were sent to Britain.         Each was allowed only one suitcase and one backpack, and was known only by a number. Lore was 152.         The mother and daughter also appeared in Melissa Hacker's Academy Award-winning 1996 film ''My Knees Were Jumping.''         Mrs. Groszmann's husband and Lore's father was Ignatz, the chief accountant of a Vienna bank, who was fired after Hitler took over Austria. At that time Lore was their only child.         In later years, when Lore thought of boarding the train, she had ''no clear recollection'' of her father's being there. She wrote, ''Every time I looked toward them it was my mother's tiny face . . . that I saw smiling steadily toward me.''         In England, Lore met the first of five foster families; with none of them would she feel comfortable. In an interview with The Jewish Week in 2001, she said her mother wrote her: ''Be good. Be obedient. Be neat. Be tidy. Always be nice.''         On the instructions her father gave her before leaving, Lore wrote the Jewish refugee committee asking it to get her parents out of Austria, as well as her grandparents, aunt and twin cousins. Her request was granted, and her parents and the others emigrated to England.         But they found work as domestic servants and could not have children living with them. . She did not live with her relatives again until after the war, when she joined them in the Dominican Republic at the age of 21.         For a time, her father was interned on the Isle of Man as a German-speaking alien. He died in the final week of the war after suffering a series of strokes. Mrs. Groszmann and her daughter lived in a small flat while Lore attended Bedford College in London.         Ms. Segal and her mother and grandmother immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic in 1951 and lived together in a small apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Groszmann worked as a salad cook at Schrafft's and as a sales clerk at a Washington Heights bakery. After helping Lore with her first baby, she trained herself to become a nurse.         In addition to Ms. Segal, Mrs. Groszmann is survived by her brother, Paul Stern, two grandchildren and two great-grandsons.         For many years, Mrs. Groszmann and Ms. Segal lived in different apartments in the same building on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. Each day at 7 a.m., the daughter would take the elevator down to have breakfast with her mother, who until three years ago rose at dawn to squeeze grapefruit juice for the two of them.       
         Kathryn O. Scott, a pioneer in the meticulous art of textile conservation whose accomplishments included doing Napoleon's personal laundry, died on Oct. 15 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Her death was confirmed by Mary Ballard, the senior textile conservator at the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education and a former protégée. Ms. Scott leaves no immediate survivors.         Ms. Scott, who almost single-handedly created the field in the United States in the decades after World War II, was one of the country's most sought-after freelance textile conservators -- and not merely because she was for years the country's only freelance textile conservator. Among her clients were the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art; the Smithsonian Institution; Colonial Williamsburg; Franklin D. Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, N.Y.; Sagamore Hill, Theodore Roosevelt's home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.; and many private collectors.         From 1964 to 1990, she was adjunct professor of conservation at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University.         Until the 1950's, museums wanting to restore a soiled or ripped textile typically resorted to a quick fix in which the damaged portion was patched or sheared away. But as anyone who has tried to iron a Qiana shirt knows, for any given textile, the wrong treatment can have disastrous consequences. For the conservator, antique textiles pose particular challenges.         ''The fibers are too fragile and they react differently,'' Ms. Ballard said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''You can't put them in the washing machine; you can't use normal detergents; you can't handle them or mount them the way you would a modern piece.''         Textile conservation is a job of clean hands and minute advances, where fabric is mended or re-embroidered or tenderly vacuumed through a screen a fraction of an inch at a sitting.         ''You don't jump in with both feet,'' Ms. Scott told a newspaper interviewer early in her career. ''You work on one-eighth of an inch at a time. Then, if you make a mistake on one-eighth of an inch, it can always be corrected.''         A textile can be a garment, of course, but it can also be a length of lace, a tapestry, a flag, a quilt or a doll, and a conservator must know how to handle all of these. Animal fibers like wool and silk behave differently from vegetable fibers like cotton and linen, and, confronted with a piece of old cloth, the conservator must first determine its composition. (One method is to set the piece on fire: different fibers give off characteristic odors when burned. Conservators discourage this.)         Textile conservators know things civilians do not, for instance, that the larvae of the clothes moth are fond of tomato-juice, beer and beef-gravy stains, while adult moths prefer the cholesterol in the ring around the collar of a wool jacket. At bibulous parties, conservators are called upon to salvage the tablecloth. (Blot gently with paper towel, then soak in white vinegar and a little clear dishwashing liquid.) All this knowledge Ms. Scott acquired, largely on her own.         Kathryn Olivia Scott, known as Kay, was born on Sept. 1, 1911, in Galesburg, Ill., and came to New York in the early 1930's. Hoping to be an artist, she studied at the Art Students League and later found work hand-painting linen neckties for John Wise, a textile dealer and collector. Shortly afterward, Mr. Wise left a box of pre-Columbian textile fragments on her doorstep with a request to preserve them.         There was nowhere to study textile conservation then, so Ms. Scott sought out archaeologists, textile scientists and museum curators and asked questions. It took her three years to restore the fragments, but by the time she finished, she had acquired a profession. She also acquired more dental and surgical tools than the average dentist or surgeon.         Ms. Scott was a master of pragmatic improvisation. In 1957 she had to replace a section of missing fringe on a 1,700-year-old Peruvian mantle owned by Herbert Hoover. The original fringe was made of twisted multicolored yarn. After having a chemical laboratory dye yarn exactly to match, Ms. Scott replicated the twist by spinning it with an electric drill.         To restore an upholstered Queen Anne chair for Colonial Williamsburg, she dyed white silk thread with coffee to mimic the natural aging of the original white embroidery.         In one of her most thrilling assignments, Ms. Scott was hired by a private collector to clean Napoleon's discolored white dress pants, vest and a nightshirt with French cuffs. She soaked the garments in a diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide, repeating the process 14 times until the discoloration was completely gone.         The project accorded Ms. Scott a title to which few can lay claim. ''You might say,'' she told an interviewer some time afterward, ''I was his laundress.''       
         The Rev. Mother Benedict Duss, who in the late 1940's helped found the first monastery for cloistered Benedictine nuns in the United States but stepped down as its abbess in 1995 amid a Vatican investigation into charges that it was being run in an authoritarian, cultlike manner, died Oct. 2 at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem, Conn. She was 94.         The death was confirmed by Sister Angèle Arbib, a spokeswoman for the abbey. At her death, Mother Benedict was abbess emerita there.         An American who trained as a surgeon in France before World War II, Mother Benedict helped found the abbey in 1947. Situated on 400 acres, it is home to a contemplative community of 37 women who farm, run a dairy and practice traditional crafts like weaving, bookbinding and ironworking.         The community, whose name is Latin for Queen of Praise, follows the Benedictine principles of prayer, hospitality and stewardship of the land. It is also famous for perpetuating the sacred tradition of Gregorian chant, which the women of Regina Laudis sing seven times daily and once each night. The abbey has released two recordings on compact disc, ''Women in Chant'' (1996) and ''Recordáre'' (2000), and a textbook, ''A Gregorian Chant Master Class'' (2002).         Mother Benedict's efforts to start the abbey inspired a popular Hollywood movie, ''Come to the Stable'' (1949). With a script by Clare Boothe Luce, the film stars Loretta Young and Celeste Holm as two young nuns trying to build a children's hospital.         Mother Benedict was born Vera Duss on Nov. 21, 1910, in Pittsburgh. When she was 3, she and her brother moved with their mother to France. In 1936, she earned a medical degree from the University of Paris. That year, she entered Notre Dame de Jouarre, a Benedictine abbey outside Paris, taking the name Sister Benedict.         During the war, she quietly continued her work as a community doctor. With Nazi officers occupying the abbey, she spent days living in near seclusion in its bell tower to escape their notice. After Allied forces liberated the abbey in August 1944, she resolved to start a Benedictine community in the United States. In 1946, she arrived in New York with Mother Mary Aline Trilles de Warren, a French nun.         The women started the Regina Laudis monastery in an abandoned factory on land donated by a Connecticut industrialist. In 1976, the Vatican elevated the monastery to an abbey; Mother Benedict was named its first abbess.         In the early 1990's, the Vatican began investigating accusations that Mother Benedict and the Rev. Francis J. Prokes, a longtime spiritual adviser to Regina Laudis, were running the abbey in a manner some critics described as cultlike.         The abbey made no public comment on the charges at the time and, through Sister Angèle, declined to comment last week.         In 1994, Father Prokes was removed as the community's spiritual adviser. ''That was a discernment of Rome, and this community has the greatest respect for that discernment,'' Sister Angèle said in a telephone interview last week.         The next year, Mother Benedict stepped down from the day-to-day administration of the abbey, becoming abbess emerita, Sister Angèle said.         Mother Benedict, who continued to live at the abbey until her death, leaves no immediate survivors.       
         C. DeLores Tucker, an outspoken advocate for minority and women's rights who marched arm in arm with Martin Luther King Jr. at Selma, Ala., and campaigned against profanity-ridden rap music lyrics, died on Oct. 12 at a rehabilitation center in Philadelphia. She was 78.         Peter Bailey, editor of ''Vital Issues: The Journal of African-American Speeches,'' which Mrs. Tucker founded, confirmed her death.         When she was 16, Mrs. Tucker raised her voice from the back of a flatbed truck to protest a Philadelphia hotel's refusal to admit black athletes. She went on to become the highest-ranking black woman in any state government when she served as secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the 1970's.         She started the first Commission on the Status of Women in Pennsylvania and helped found and led the National Political Congress of Black Women. She held leadership positions in the Democratic Party, the National Women's Caucus and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, among many other organizations.         Mrs. Tucker achieved perhaps her greatest fame in the 1990's when she campaigned against gangsta rap lyrics, calling them ''sleazy, pornographic smut.'' At one point, she bought 20 shares of Time-Warner stock and rose at an annual meeting to demand the company's leaders read aloud the lyrics on records one of their subsidiaries was selling. They declined.         In her zeal to fight gangsta rap, the fiercely partisan Democrat found herself allied with William J. Bennett, the conservative Republican who held top posts in the presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.         Despite having raised more than $1 million for the N.A.A.C.P. as a public speaker, she picketed the organization's Image Awards because the rapper Tupac Shakur had been nominated for one. At the time, he was accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old female fan in New York and with shooting two Atlanta police officers in a traffic dispute.         At her funeral on Oct. 21, former Vice President Al Gore, one of many political leaders in attendance, called Mrs. Tucker ''a four-star general in the battle for righteousness.''         Cynthia DeLores Nottage was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 4, 1927, as the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. Whitfield Nottage and the former Captilda Gardiner. The children were raised in a strict religious atmosphere, not allowed to dance, listen to music or date until they were 21.         Because her father refused to accept pay for his pastor posts, Mrs. Tucker's mother became an entrepreneur to feed the family. She founded an employment agency for Southern blacks who migrated northward for jobs, ran a grocery store and became a landlord. When Mrs. Tucker later inherited some of those properties, political opponents accused her of being a slumlord.         She attended Temple University but did not earn a degree. Her first involvement in civil rights came when she registered black voters for a Philadelphia mayoral campaign in 1950.         The next year, she married William Tucker, a real estate executive, who is her only immediate survivor. They had no children but helped raise a number of relatives in their extended families.         In the 1960's, she campaigned for black candidates, served on the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee and earned a reputation as an excellent fund-raiser. She was the first black and the first woman elected to the Philadelphia Zoning Board. In 1971, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her secretary of the commonwealth, equivalent to secretary of state in other states.         As secretary, she was a leader in instituting voter registration by mail and lowering the voting age to 18. Governor Shapp fired her in 1977 because of accusations that she used state employees to write speeches for which she was paid $66,931.         She ran unsuccessfully for Congress, lieutenant governor and the United States Senate.         Her involvement with gangsta rap began when a niece she was raising was ostracized for using foul language she had picked up from listening to the music. Music industry executives responded by suing her, and much of her later life was tangled in complicated suits and countersuits.         In 1997, she sued the estate of Mr. Shakur, who was shot to death the year before, for $10 million, alleging defamation for mentioning her in an obscene lyric. The suit was dismissed.       
         Catherine M. Pessino, a naturalist and educator who spent more than three decades introducing young people to wildlife in the most inhospitable of places -- the sidewalks, sewers and catchment basins of New York City -- died on Nov. 5 in Mount Vernon, N.Y. She was 80.         Her death was announced by the Great Gull Island Committee, a conservation group of which Ms. Pessino was a past chairwoman. She was also on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History for many years.         In 1954, Ms. Pessino helped found the museum's first natural science center for children, directing it through several incarnations. The center still offers classes for children and families.         She was also known for her intensive studies of terns on Great Gull Island, a bird sanctuary off the eastern tip of Long Island. Her work there helped bring thousands of the birds back to the island to nest.         Catherine Mary Pessino was born in the Bronx in 1925. She received a bachelor's degree in biology from Hunter College in 1946, and shortly afterward was hired to work at the museum's information desk. The next year, she joined the education department.         When Ms. Pessino first came to the museum, its dusty, glassed-in exhibits were geared primarily to adult visitors. What was more, she realized, most city children considered the natural world irrelevant. In 1954, Ms. Pessino and several colleagues established the Peter Van Gerbig Natural Science Center at the museum. It was intended to be a place where children could not only study nature but also handle it, often for the first time.         There were other nature centers for children around the country, but perhaps none focused so intimately on urban life forms. In 1960, Ms. Pessino became the head of the center, renamed the Alexander M. White Natural Science Center. In 1973, she oversaw the creation of new exhibits that showcased the flora, fauna and geology of New York.         There were pussy willows, and a piece of city sidewalk with a tree growing through it. There was an ant farm, and an escaped tropical lizard that had been apprehended in Central Park. There were starlings and squirrels, frogs and fossils and dandelions.         Of course, there was a cockroach display. It was one of the easiest for Ms. Pessino to pull together.         In addition to running the natural science center, Ms. Pessino supervised the Louis Calder Natural Science Laboratory at the museum, where students could conduct research. She also advised the New York City Board of Education on the science curriculum.         During these years, Ms. Pessino was also closely involved with the Great Gull Island Committee. A joint project of the museum and the Linnaean Society of New York, the committee oversees research on the island's tern population. In the course of her work, Ms. Pessino spent many weeks living on the island, a desolate outcropping in Long Island Sound seven miles off Orient Point.         Until the mid-19th century, Great Gull Island was home to vast colonies of nesting terns. By the end of the century, hundreds of thousands had been slaughtered for the millinery trade. In 1897, the federal government began building Fort Michie on the island, which was soon overrun with buildings and ordnance. This devastated the remaining tern population.         Designed to protect the entrance to the sound, the fort remained active through the end of World War II. The museum acquired the island in 1949.         In 1950, Ms. Pessino and a colleague, Lois J. Hussey, were put ashore there, amid the ruins of the derelict fort. There was no telephone, fresh water, plumbing or electricity. The Coast Guardsmen who ferried them across spoke gleefully of shipwrecked sailors, and of ''mosquitoes so large that one holds you by the arms while another sucks blood,'' the women wrote in the April 1951 issue of Natural History magazine.         They stayed for a month, setting up camp in an abandoned observation tower alongside companionable spiders and mice. They found no terns nesting on the island, though a number visited each day to feed.         ''To see flocks of 20, 50 or 200 terns feeding is an unforgettable sight,'' the women wrote. ''The contrast of black caps and gleaming white feathers, flashes of brightly colored bills and feet, the seemingly effortless and marvelously graceful flight produce a never-to-be-forgotten picture. They fly over the water with heads bent, pause, hover for an instant, then plunge headfirst into the water.''         On subsequent visits, Ms. Pessino and her co-workers made a habitat for the terns by clearing undergrowth, tearing down Quonset huts and covering exposed concrete with sand and beach grass. Little by little, the birds returned to the island.         Today, about 1,600 pairs of roseate terns and about 9,500 pairs of common terns nest there, according to Helen Hays, the current chairwoman of the Great Gull Island Committee.         With Ms. Hussey, Ms. Pessino wrote three books for young people, all published by Thomas Y. Crowell: ''Collecting Cocoons'' (1953); ''Collecting Small Fossils'' (1970); and ''Collecting for the City Naturalist'' (1975).         Ms. Pessino, who retired from the museum in 1985, leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Law Nolte, a writer and family counselor whose ubiquitous inspirational poem, ''Children Learn What They Live,'' was photocopied, circulated, anthologized and affixed to refrigerator doors worldwide for nearly two decades before she claimed rightful authorship of it in the 1970's, died on Nov. 6 at her home in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         In 1954, Mrs. Nolte, who wrote a weekly column on family matters for The Torrance Herald, a local newspaper, found herself on deadline and strapped for material. She composed a 14-line poem on childrearing that would become a mantra for millions of parents.         The poem quickly took on a life of its own. It was copied repeatedly and passed from hand to hand. It was printed on plaques and posters. It was distributed to millions of new parents by a maker of baby formula.         Earlier this year, Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan announced that he would raise his daughter, Princess Aiko, by its tenets.         For years, the poem was widely believed to be anonymous, and Mrs. Nolte received neither credit nor compensation. Unaware that she had loosed a genie on the world, she soon forgot about it.         In 1972, after discovering how big her poem had become, Mrs. Nolte copyrighted it. In 1998, she expanded it into a book, ''Children Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Values,'' written with Rachel Harris. The book has more than 3 million copies in print worldwide and has been translated into 18 languages, according to its publisher, Workman Publishing.         Mrs. Nolte and Ms. Harris also collaborated on a sequel, ''Teenagers Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Integrity and Independence,'' published by Workman in 2002.         Considered timeless wisdom by some and undiluted treacle by others, Mrs. Nolte's poem is organized as a series of logical propositions:         If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.         If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.         If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.         If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves.         But do not despair, the poem seems to say. It continues:         If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.         If children live with tolerance, they learn patience.         If children live with praise, they learn appreciation.         If children live with acceptance, they learn to love.         The poem has time-honored antecedents in Western oral tradition. With its steady rhythm and gentle didacticism, it recalls well-loved nursery rhymes or ballads. As with much oral literature that is later written down, it circulated in a number of variant texts over the years, some longer, some shorter, some with altered language.         Mrs. Nolte herself changed the poem in later years to make it gender-neutral. (The original read, ''If a child lives with criticism, he learns to condemn,'' and so on.)         Dorothy Louise McDaniel was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 12, 1924. She held various jobs before training as a family counselor in the 1950's. In recent years, she lectured often on childrearing.         Mrs. Nolte's first marriage, to Durwood Law, ended in divorce. She married Claude Nolte in 1959. With her second husband, Mrs. Nolte wrote a book, ''Wake Up in Bed, Together! A Handbook for Sexual Repatterning'' (Stein & Day, 1975).         Mr. Nolte died in 1988. Mrs. Nolte is survived by two children from her first marriage, Joyce Jameson of Gold Canyon, Ariz., and Gerald Law of Rancho Santa Margarita; a daughter from her second marriage, Lisa Mulvania, of Huntington Beach, Calif.; a stepson, David Nolte, of Kailua, Hawaii; eight grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild.       
         Marjorie Kellogg, who poured her personal experiences into the bestselling book ''Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon,'' her story of three disabled people keeping house together, died on Dec. 19 at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 83 and was for many years a resident of Manhattan.         The death was announced by her companion, Sylvia Short, a stage and film actress, who is her only immediate survivor. The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, she said.         Trained as a hospital social worker, Miss Kellogg blended some of the women and men she met into the story line of her first novel, a sardonic, funny, occasionally biting but mostly tender tale of patients who meet at a hospital, decide to live together, then often quarrel and nag one another. She was persuaded to put the characters into a book by a friend, the novelist and memoirist Paula Fox, with whom she had previously collaborated on a television play.         ''Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon'' (Farrar, Straus, 1968) reached the best-seller lists and drew considerable praise from critics.         ''It is a tight, engaging and exceptionally nice novel,'' wrote Eliot Fremont-Smith in The New York Times, ''and if tears come to the reader's eyes, they are a measure of the passion of compassion that it conveys.''         Jonathan Kozol, in The Times Book Review, called it a ''rare little novel'' that deserved ''considerable praise and admiration.''         Miss Kellogg also wrote the screenplay for the 1970 film by the same name, directed by Otto Preminger, with Liza Minnelli as the title character.         She next wrote ''Like the Lion's Tooth'' (Farrar, 1972), again drawing from life, to tell about three emotionally disturbed children. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The Times deemed it overly sentimental and ''not worth doing,'' though other reviewers found it a stark and compelling novel and stylistically an improvement over her first.         Miss Kellogg wrote more screenplays, but nothing equal to her own for ''Junie Moon.'' She adapted Sylvia Plath's ''Bell Jar'' for a 1979 movie with Julie Harris, and wrote several stage plays, including ''After You've Gone,'' which was initially presented by the Actor's Repertory Theater in 1982.         Marjorie Kellogg was born in Santa Barbara. She attended the University of California, Berkeley, worked on the copy desk of The San Francisco Examiner for a while and tried her luck as a magazine writer in Spain. She next was a publicist in San Francisco, then entered Smith College, where she got a bachelor's in 1952 and a master's a year later, both in social work.         Working for social-welfare agencies in New York, she tried some creative writing for television on the side. While she was collaborating on a play with Paula Fox, Ms. Fox challenged her to sit down and write a novel about the people she met at work at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.         After some reluctance, Miss Kellogg did and finished the book in five months, working before and after her shifts at the hospital.       
         Débora Arango, a prolific artist who at first repelled socially conservative Colombia with stark paintings of nudes and social conflict but who was later celebrated as one of the country's most inventive, daring artists, died on Dec. 4 at her rambling colonial home outside Medellín. She was 98.         Her death was confirmed by a great-nephew, Pedro Miguel Estrada.         In a career that began nearly 80 years ago and lasted until late in life, Ms. Arango produced countless works that often depicted the hurdles and indignities she found in being a woman in a strict Roman Catholic country. She made dramatic paintings of prostitutes, which shocked midcentury sensibilities, and one of a woman giving birth in prison.         Though a product of a traditional, affluent family from the Antioquia province of Colombia, Ms. Arango produced work that pushed the bounds of decorum, vividly touching on delicate and troubling subjects like Colombia's political violence, poverty and brutality. In her work, she depicted a 1950's-era Colombian dictator, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, as a toad, and portrayed a military junta as five monkeys wrapped in Colombia's flag.         Ms. Arango always pushed boundaries, even as a young girl. In a favorite story, she talked about how she wore pants to ride horses, unheard of in her time, and about how her father permitted her to drive the family car.         ''In those times in Medellín, there were three women who drove: a foreigner, the daughter of a trucker and me,'' she said.         One of 12 children, Ms. Arango first studied art at 13 at the rigid Catholic school she attended in Medellín and later at the city's Instituto de Bellas Artes. In 1935, she began working with Pedro Nel Gómez, a well-known artist who painted murals that portrayed the powerful and influential of Colombian society.         Despite living amid anti-reform movements, Ms. Arango began to capture social issues in her work, as well as the female body, which she often depicted as corpulent and wrinkled.         Ms. Arango first caused a public stir in 1939 when she exhibited in Antioquia with established male artists. In 1940, after an exhibition in Bogotá, the newspaper El Siglo said of her works, ''They constitute a true attack against the culture and artistic tradition of our capital city.'' Ms. Arango's work also came under assault in Spain in 1955, when the dictator Francisco Franco closed an exhibition of her paintings.         Ms. Arango, like the better-known Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, was inspired by the muralist movement of Mexico, which captured Latin America's roiling history in epic proportions. She never became a muralist, but she did paint large, trying to hammer her message with broad, thick brushstrokes. Her subjects inhabited the seamy side of small-town life: drunken men leaving a bar, a woman roughed up by policemen, an emaciated child in a mother's arms.         ''She did it with brazen language,'' Fernando Botero, Colombia's most renowned artist, said of Ms. Arango's message in a telephone interview from his studio in Paris. ''She was not preoccupied with aesthetics. What was central was expressing herself.''         Her paintings also tackled subjects that in an isolated, provincial country in the 1940's and 50's were best left alone. What she saw as hypocrisy in the church became an important subject for her. In one famous painting, Ms. Arango portrayed a group of nuns circling a caged bird, a cardinal. In another, a boxcar is filled with bodies, a reminder of the relentless political violence that has marked Colombia for decades. Ms. Arango often focused on race and poverty, as well as on corrupt leaders.         ''She was capable of condemning,'' said Alberto Sierra, curator of the Museum of Antioquia in Medellín and an expert on Ms. Arango's work. ''Politically, Débora was a voice of protest as things were unfolding. A lot of artists wait and portray events after they happened.''         As Colombia opened itself up to the world and produced celebrated artists like Mr. Botero and writers like Gabriel García Márquez, Ms. Arango's work eventually found acceptance and critical acclaim.         Though her art has been exhibited in Madrid and the United States, Ms. Arango never sought fame and was reluctant to have her paintings shown. Still, in Colombia art books feature her work, and the Museum of Modern Art in Medellín boasts of the 233 pieces she donated in 1986.         In old age, she continued to work, her paintings climbing the walls of her beloved house in the town of Envigado. She delighted in having visitors, surprising them with her sharp wit.         When one asked her about her relationships with men, whom Ms. Arango's art often portrayed in a less-than-positive light, she said, ''Men never thought much of me, and I never thought much of them, either.''         Her diminishing skills forced her to give up painting in the last year or two of her life. In 2003, shortly before receiving the Cruz de Boyacá, Colombia's most important honor, she recognized the inevitable.         ''There is so much to paint, but the tears come to my eyes and I cannot do it like I would like,'' she said. ''I was very bold, but you start to wear down with the years.''       
         Margretta Madden Styles, a nursing educator who conceived and helped establish precise national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Clearwater, Fla. She was 75.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         It was in the 1970's that Dr. Styles and others began to press for stricter certification of nurses and a rational system to regulate them. She lectured and wrote on the subject in nursing journals, contributing articles on advanced nursing practices and ways to determine criteria for issuing sound credentials.         In the 1980's she helped found the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which now administers testing for more than 20 medical specialties and, said Catherine L. Gilliss, dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, ''helped to standardize across the nation just what to expect from your nurse.''         The center is the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, which represents 150,000 nurses and nurse specialists. Dr. Styles served as the association's president from 1986 to 1988.         Later in her career she studied the emerging importance of trained nurses in developing countries and, in 1993, was elected president of the International Council of Nurses.         She continued to write on certification and helped edit a popular anthology, ''On Nursing: A Literary Celebration'' (1993), which ''framed the art of healing, the pain of suffering, and was received as a gift to the profession,'' said Barbara A. Blakeney, the current president of the American Nurses Association.         Margretta Madden was born in Mount Union, Pa., and earned an undergraduate degree from Juniata College, a master's from Yale and a doctorate in education from the University of Florida.         She worked as a staff nurse in hospitals before becoming an associate professor of nursing at Duke in 1967. She was dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit; and finally at the University of California, San Francisco.         Dr. Styles's husband of 47 years, the Rev. Douglas Styles, an Episcopal priest, died in 2002.         She is survived by two sons, Michael, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Patrick, of Redmond, Wash.; a daughter, Megan Styles of Danville, Calif.; a brother, Joseph Madden of Indian Rocks, Fla.; a sister, Jane Rupp of St. Petersburg; and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Aiken Littauer, whose love affair with horses began with a childhood pony, blossomed with her marriage to an officer in the cavalry of Czar Nicholas II, and flowered famously when she became a leading expert on horses of ancient times, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Syosset, N.Y. She was 93.         Her son, Andrew, announced the death.         Mrs. Littauer's scholarly career did not begin until her mid-50's, when her husband's health would no longer permit him to maintain his standards of horsemanship. The standards were high indeed: Vladimir S. Littauer was the author of eight books on riding and training horses, and his instructional techniques are still used.         Not wanting to ride alone, Mrs. Littauer was restless. Her husband suggested she write a book about horses.         She had had no college education, but decided to start at the beginning. By bringing her keen intelligence and considerable horse sense to archaeological discoveries, she would write about when and how horses and men got together. Her first article, ''The Function of the Yoke Saddle in Ancient Harnessing,'' appeared in the British journal Antiquity in 1968.         The same year, Mrs. Littauer was introduced to Joost Crouwel, who had just earned a degree in classical archaeology from the University of Amsterdam and was beginning his doctoral thesis on Mycenaean chariots. A collaboration of three decades began.         Dr. Crouwel became professor of Aegean archaeology at the University of Amsterdam. Mrs. Littauer gained fame as the Grande Dame of the study of horses.         The two wrote about 65 articles for academic journals, usually with each other though sometimes with other scholars and sometimes individually. A typical title: ''The Earliest Evidence for Metal Bridle Parts.''         They wrote two books, ''Wheeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East'' (1970) and ''Chariots and Related Equipment from the Tomb of Tutankhamen'' (1985). Both became standard reference works.         ''They have set international standards that will last for many years,'' said Peter Raulvig, an archaeologist and linguist who also studied chariots.         In 2002, Mrs. Littauer and Dr. Crouwel published a collection titled ''Selected Writing on Chariots and Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness.''         An example of Mrs. Littauer's analysis was her article in 1983 in La Recherche, a French counterpart of Scientific American, in which she rejected earlier assertions that the first wheels were used on two-wheeled carts. Instead, she argued, the first real wheel was on a crude four-wheel vehicle. She theorized that soft sands in the Middle East would have made a two-wheeled precursor of the chariot impractical, and pointed to the four-wheeled carriages discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in the so-called King's Tomb in Ur, a Sumerian city that flourished in Lower Mesopotamia (now Iraq) about 4,500 years ago.         But she disputed Sir Leonard's contention that the vehicles were the ''tanks'' of antiquity. The reason was that the harness used was highly vulnerable to projectiles, not to mention the vehicle's occupants, The New York Times reported in 1983.         Her ability to interpret evidence found by others became legendary. She once pointed out that an ancient horse's bit displayed in the British Museum was upside down. Embarrassed curators corrected the error.         Mary Aiken Graver was born in Pittsburgh on Feb. 11, 1912, and grew up in Manhattan. Her formal education ended when she graduated from what is now the Spence School. Her interest in horses dates from her ownership of a cow pony in Nevada, where her family vacationed.         As a young woman, she was a volunteer courier in the Frontier Nursing Service, which provided health care in rural Kentucky. For young society women, the chance to ride horses for many miles over roadless, mountainous terrain in a good cause was grand adventure. She was once caught in the middle of a shooting battle between feuding families.         Mr. Littauer founded a riding academy called the Boots and Saddles Club, and also taught private clients at the family's Long Island home before his death in 1989, at 96. In addition to their son, of Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Littauer is survived by two grandsons.         Already fluent in French, Mrs. Littauer taught herself ancient Greek, German and Russian. Scholars sent her their research results, commentaries and papers to edit.         Mary B. Moore, an art historian at Hunter College specializing in ancient Greece, said that Mrs. Littauer advised colleagues on how an ancient bit or bridle was probably used, or on where the driver would have stood on a chariot. Dr. Moore said those suggestions were utterly practical, and seldom theoretical or aesthetic.         She said that Mrs. Littauer seldom went to archaeological digs, because of her age. ''Sitting around a ditch all day wouldn't have been one of those things she would go for.''         She was nonetheless famously observant. In a paper on the Roman use of horses, Judith A. Walker, an archaeologist, mentioned a chariot and harness found in an ancient tomb.         ''No one person has spent more time studying, reconstructing and analyzing this harness and chariot than Mary Littauer,'' she wrote.         Mrs. Littauer embodied skepticism, as when what appeared to be wheels of chariots were found on the Russian steppes. In an article in The New York Times in 1994, she cautioned, ''A spoked wheel is not necessarily a chariot, only a light car on the way to becoming a chariot.''         On rare occasions, Mrs. Littauer ventured beyond the ancient world, with an interest as modern as the horses of medieval knights.       
         Selma Jeanne Cohen, a historian, editor and teacher who devoted her career to proclaiming dance an art worthy of the same scholarly respect traditionally awarded to painting, music and literature, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Leslie Steinau, her lawyer and a longtime friend.         Ms. Cohen waged a tireless campaign against scholars who maintained that dance was inherently frivolous. Instead, she believed it had a rich history that could be fruitfully analyzed from many philosophical viewpoints. Her efforts led her to become America's leading figure in dance scholarship.         Her most ambitious achievement was her editing of The International Encyclopedia of Dance for Oxford University Press. Published in 1998 after two decades of planning, and encompassing all forms of dance, the six-volume work, modeled on The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, remains the most comprehensive guide of its kind.         Eclectic scholarly interests had prompted Ms. Cohen, A. J.Pischl and Sheppard Black in 1959 to found Dance Perspectives, a journal dedicated to monographs on various aspects of world dance. Ms. Cohen became its sole editor in 1966. After it ceased publication in 1976, the Dance Perspectives Foundation, which she had established, continued to award an annual prize for the best dance book of the year.         Ms. Cohen was born in Chicago, attended elementary and high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School and went on to the university itself, receiving a Ph.D. in English in 1946.         When a childhood friend started taking ballet lessons from Edna McRae, a respected Chicago teacher, Ms. Cohen went along. Ms. Cohen soon realized she had no dancing talent. But she had great curiosity, and McRae had a dance library, which Ms. Cohen devoured.         She began teaching English at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1946 and, at the same time, worked with the Los Angeles teacher and choreographer Eugene Loring. After moving to New York in 1953, she devoted herself to dance and started reviewing for Dance Observer. From 1955 to 1958 she was a dance critic at The New York Times, where she assisted John Martin, who was chief dance critic. She was dance critic for The Saturday Review in 1965 and 1966.         Ms. Cohen was a member of the first National Endowment for the Arts Dance Panel in 1966; organized a critics' conference at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., in 1970; and taught over the years at many colleges, including the University of Chicago, where she returned to head summer seminars from 1974 to 1976. Ms. Cohen wrote and edited several important books, among them ''The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1966), an anthology of essays by contemporary choreographers; ''Doris Humphrey: An Artist First'' (Wesleyan, 1972), a biography of a pioneering modern dancer; and ''Next Week, Swan Lake'' (Wesleyan, 1982), a study of dance aesthetics. Her ''Dance as a Theater Art'' (Dodd, Mead, 1974), a history of dance since the Renaissance, remains a popular college text.         Ms. Cohen, a tiny soft-spoken woman, could be a rigorous teacher, but she delighted in presiding graciously over social events. Friends, colleagues and students often met informally at her apartment, gatherings usually graced by Giselle, her long-lived and much-pampered cat. Ms. Cohen often jokingly said she hoped to write a treatise on feline aesthetics someday.         No immediate family members survive.
