         Willette Craine Murray, a founder of La Famille restaurant in Harlem, a fixture for Southern food and Sunday-night jazz, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 82.         Her husband, Earle, said she died of a heart attack.         From the time Mrs. Murray and her sister, the late Viola James, opened their restaurant with their husbands, Oswald Craine and Ben James, in 1958, the fresh corn bread, fried chicken, braised short ribs, black-eyed peas and string beans drew crowds to the restaurant, on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street.         When the restaurant was sold in 1989, La Famille, which opened with seating for 40, had spread into three dining rooms, where 300 people could dine while listening to jazz bands that Mrs. Murray helped make a Sunday night fixture.         For Mrs. Murray, a native of Charlotte, N.C., who came to New York in 1933, owning and operating a business on 125th Street was a triumph. One of the first black women to work on 125th Street, she had to march on picket lines in the 1930's to win her first job, washing glasses at a dime-store lunch counter.         She later worked as dining room hostess and assistant banquet manager at the old Theresa Hotel.         Mrs. Murray, whose sister and first husband died many years ago, is survived by Mr. Murray.       
         Teresa Teng, a singer from Taiwan whose love songs won her spectacular fame across East Asia, died suddenly on a holiday in Thailand on Monday. She was 40.         Miss Teng had been having respiratory difficulties since earlier this year, according to the Kyodo News Agency in Tokyo. She reportedly died after an asthmatic attack in the northern resort city of Chiang Mai, where she was vacationing with a French friend.         Kyodo reported that Thai doctors attributed her death to heart failure, but an autopsy had not yet been conducted.         Miss Teng was especially famous in China, where for much of the 1980's she was a litmus test of the political winds: when the authorities eased controls, her music sold briskly in stalls in the tiniest towns; when the hard-liners clamped down, her music was banned.         She was one of the first foreign singers whose music was swept into China after the country started opening up in the late 1970's, and she soon became a symbol of capitalist joys.         Known in Chinese as Deng Lijun, Miss Teng's surname was the same as that of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. So she was jokingly known as Little Deng, and in some circles she was nearly as famous as he. Even peasants in the countryside were familiar with her songs and brightly colored costumes.         Many other foreign singers became popular in China, but none captured the hearts of the country as she did.         From Singapore to Japan, Miss Teng was a superstar and brilliant linguist. She sang in Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese Chinese, Japanese and English, and in recent years she had lived in Japan and become popular among both the young and the old.         Her songs were bright and mellifluous, and her voice clear and sweet. Among her best-known songs were "The Moon Is a Reflection of My Heart" and "When Will You Return." In a song called "The Story of a Little Town," she sings:         Many are the stories of a small town         Full of joy and happiness.         If you came to this little town,         How much you would reap.         It looks like a painting,         It sounds like a song.         Relatives flew to Thailand today to make funeral arrangements.       
         Esther Rome, co-author of the best seller "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and women's health advocate for more than 25 years, died at her home in Somerville, Mass., on Saturday. She was 49.         The cause was breast cancer, said a friend, Judith Norsigian.         Ms. Rome argued that issues of cosmetic surgery, eating disorders, body image and sexually transmitted diseases as they affected women belonged in the social- and economic-policy arena as much as in the medical world. She was instrumental in fostering the public debate over toxic shock syndrome and its link to the use of tampons in the early 1980's.         A decade later, she served as a consumer advocate on the Food and Drug Administration committee that investigated the potential hazards of silicone breast implants. The committee's work led to a partial ban on implants and Ms. Rome led a support group for women with implants who had health problems.         Until days before her death, she was working on her latest book, "Risking Health for Love," with her co-author, Jane Hyman, that examines the health risks of choices that women make, covering breast implants, sexually transmitted diseases and domestic violence.         Ms. Rome was among 12 young professional women who were not medical experts but who were concerned about health issues who gathered in a lounge at M.I.T. in 1969 to exchange the information about doctors and other health topics. The group later formed the Boston Women's Health Book Collective.         A year later, the women published a collection of papers challenging long-held approaches to medical treatment of women. The papers addressed a range of topics including childbirth and rape. Called "Women and Their Bodies," it was a 75-cent newsprint guide to the physical and psychological makeup of women. In 1971 they changed the name to "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and the book inspired a grass-roots, consumer-advocacy movement, becoming a bible to a generation of young women.         In college dormitories and apartments across the country groups of female baby-boomers, hungry for the kind of information their mothers did not always have, gathered to discuss the book. They formed support groups and grappled with women's health issues made more immediate by the availability of birth-control pills and the legalization of abortion.         The book was attacked as pornographic by the Moral Majority and other conservative groups and it was banned from some schools. By 1973 it had sold more than 350,000 copies. Now in its third edition, it has sold nearly three million copies in the United States and has been translated into 14 foreign languages, including Hebrew, Swedish and Greek, said a spokeswoman for its publisher, Simon & Schuster.         Ms. Rome was born in Norwich, Conn. She graduated from Brandeis University in 1966 and received a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1968.         She is survived by her husband, Nathan; two sons, Judah and Micah, both of Somerville; two brothers, Aaron Seidman of Brookline and Abe Seidman of Beverly Hills, Calif., and a sister, Sara Levine of Dallas.       
         Sylvia Weinberger, who used a sprinkling of matzoh meal, a pinch of salt and a dollop of schmaltzmanship to turn chopped liver into a commercial success, died on July 23 at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 89 and had lived in Boca Raton, Fla.         Mrs. Weinberger started making chopped liver for a luncheonette she and her husband, Irving, had opened in 1944 on the Grand Concourse at 169th Street in the Bronx. She ended up presiding over a $2 million-a-year operation as the proprietor of the semi-eponymous Mrs. Weinberg's Chopped Liver. She once said her name had been shortened because of typographical necessity when her first labels were printed: "My whole name wouldn't fit."         According to her son Richard, Mrs. Weinberg's had become the leading brand of chopped liver at kosher counters from New York to Chicago by the time she retired in 1989. But when it began, it was all Mrs. Weinberger could do to make it acceptable on the Grand Concourse.         At that time, store-bought chopped liver was almost an oxymoron, something to be smuggled home in a plain brown wrapper because no self-respecting Jewish homemaker was likely to admit that she did not have enough bedrock mother love or culinary skills to make it herself.         "I used to give it away," Mrs. Weinberger once said.         Never mind that chopped liver is the metaphorical butt of a Jewish retort ("What am I, chopped liver?"). In many Jewish homes, it is both a staple and a delicacy, one whose proper preparation has been described as the culinary test that divides Jewish moms from Jewish mothers.         Mrs. Weinberger's version apparently passed the test. After much wheedling and cajoling by Mrs. Weinberger, her chopped liver caught on -- so much so, Mrs. Weinberger once recalled, that when she put up a sign, "Mrs. Weinberger's chopped liver with a smile," "People used to say, 'Keep the smile, just give me the liver.' "         As the product became more popular, Mr. Weinberger started soliciting supermarkets in the Bronx. But when the first big order came in, for two cases, his wife was somewhat unprepared.         "We didn't have any boxes or cases," she said. "We delivered the individual containers in plastic bags."         Mrs. Weinberger, a Hungarian refugee, came to the United States in 1937 with two young sons to join her husband. She helped support the family by working as a seamstress while her husband worked in a laundry until they had saved enough to buy the luncheonette.         They sold it in 1955 to manufacture chopped liver full time. Other kosher products, all based on Mrs. Weinberger's recipes, were later added to the Mrs. Weinberg's Food Products line. The family sold the manufacturing company, but Mr. Weinberger continues to be the distributor.         In addition to Richard, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., Mrs. Weinberger is survived by another son, Sidney, of Boca Raton, and six grandchildren.         Correction:  August 3, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Sylvia Weinberger, who founded Mrs. Weinberg's Chopped Liver, misstated the given name of one of her sons. He is Fred Weinberger, not Richard.       
         Joyce Steins, a supporter of the arts and social causes who owned and operated several trendy Manhattan restaurants before retiring three years ago, died on Sunday in Riverhead Hospital on Long Island. A West Side resident, she was 52.         The cause was breast cancer, O. Aldon James Jr., a close friend, said.         Most recently she was the founder, owner and operating manager of Cafe Iguana on Park Avenue South, at 19th Street, a multilevel 225-seat Tex-Mex restaurant that had a strong following. Ms. Steins, the self-styled Mama Iguana, often went from table to table, extending personal greetings and chatting with regulars. The restaurant went out of business with her retirement.         She was born in Manhattan, and graduated with degrees in English and anthropology from the University of Hawaii. She was working on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History when a restaurateur interested her in the business. Changing course, she became a bus girl.         Twenty years later, in the early 1970's, she became an owner of El Rio Grande on East 38th Street, followed by Le Bar Bat on West 57th Street, a restaurant decorated with flying bats of blue, handblown glass. She later sold her stakes in them. Both remain in business.         She used her establishments for fund-raisers to benefit arts organizations and agencies combating AIDS, multiple sclerosis and child abuse.         Ms. Steins is survived by her sister, Loretta Friedman of West Hampton, L.I.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Adele Simpson, an important player in the postwar fashion movement, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 91.         Mrs. Simpson took French couture and gave it an American ready-to-wear interpretation. Her color-coordinated dresses and jackets and well-cut coats in fine fabrics found favor among well-heeled women of her time in search of classic clothes that did not cost a month's rent.         Mrs. Simpson's popularity spanned more than three decades, from the late 1940's through the 1970's. Her coming of age as a designer mirrored the development of American sportswear, which was defining itself and growing in importance as the mass-market technology that followed World War II left its mark on fashion.         Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon and Barbara Bush were among those who wore her designs, and her collections were available in some of the nation's finest stores, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and Saks Fifth Avenue.         "She made clothes for ladies," said Helen O'Hagan, a fashion publicist who once worked at Saks. "They were beautifully made and designed. It wasn't advanced, but that wasn't who she was after."         Mrs. Simpson was born Adele Smithline in New York City, the fifth daughter of Latvian immigrants. In 1927, she married Wesley Simpson, a textile executive.         At 21, after completing design studies at Pratt Institute, she replaced her older sister Anna as head designer for Ben Girshel, then an important Seventh Avenue manufacturer. A few years later, she went to work for Mary Lee, another Seventh Avenue manufacturer. In 1949, she bought the company and renamed it Adele Simpson.         As was the practice of the day, she traveled regularly to Paris to gather inspiration and copy French designs.         Mrs. Simpson was the recipient of numerous fashion accolades, including the Coty American Fashion Critics award in 1947.         For the wedding of President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci, in 1966, Mrs. Simpson designed for the mother of the bride a wrinkle-resistant yellow silk street-length coat, matching princess-line dress and hat. This ensemble, with it color coordination and clean, practical lines, was typical of Mrs. Simpson's concept of fashion.         She continued designing into her 70's, retiring in 1985. Her daughter, Joan Raines, and son-in-law, Richard Raines, ran the business after her retirement. In 1991, the family sold the business to Barron Peters, a clothing company in Lowell, Mass., which has since filed for bankruptcy and discontinued the Adele Simpson line.         Mrs. Simpson's husband died in 1976.         In addition to her daughter, Joan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Simpson is survived by a son, Jeffrey, also of Manhattan, and three grandsons.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Benay Venuta, whose career in show business began as a teen-age dancer in 1925 and ended with a bit part in Woody Allen's 1993 movie, "Manhattan Murder Mystery," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter Patricia Winter.         A singer, actress, radio personality, painter and sculptor, Ms. Venuta was best known as an active participant in New York theater for more than 50 years. Her Broadway career began when, as a virtual unknown, she replaced Ethel Merman, who became her close friend, in Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" in 1935.         Ms. Venuta went on to leading roles on Broadway in such shows as "By Jupiter," "Nellie Bly," "Hazel Flagg," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye" and "Copper and Brass." She toured and played summer stock and regional theaters in "A Little Night Music," "Bus Stop," "Gypsy," "Come Blow Your Horn," "Auntie Mame," "Light Up the Sky" and "Pal Joey."         She also performed at Lincoln Center in revivals of "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Carousel."         In Hollywood, Ms. Venuta appeared in films including "The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown," "Call Me Mister" and "Annie Get Your Gun."         Ms. Venuta was named Benvenuta Rose Crooke at her birth in San Francisco in 1911.         In a 1935 interview, she said that when she quit high school to go into show business she "just added a 'ay' to Ben and the rest I guess you can figure."         Ms. Venuta said her grandfather sent her to a finishing school in Geneva. She dropped out (but not before learning French and Italian), went off to London and came home in 1929 to discover her family was broke.         "My father was dead, and I had to go to work," she said. "You know the rest -- nightclubs, radio, hoofing -- then this."         She was speaking of her big break in "Anything Goes."         For much of her life, Ms. Venuta painted and made sculptures, and for a time in the 1970's her Plexiglas sculptures were sold at Bonwit Teller in Manhattan for $150 to $1,500.         Ms. Venuta was married and divorced three times.         In addition to Ms. Winter, she is survived by another daughter, Deborah Herschel, both of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Helen Vlachos, a publisher who closed her newspapers and fled Greece rather than submit to censorship under the military junta that ruled from 1967 to 1974, died on Saturday, Reuters reported yesterday from Athens, quoting officials at the press ministry. She was 85.         Ms. Vlachos was a legend in Greek journalism whose popularity rose in the late 1940's when she began writing a column in her father's respected daily paper, Kathimerini, in which she regularly criticized the Government.         In 1951, she took over Kathimerini and Messimvrini, another daily newspaper, as well as the weekly picture magazine Eikones, but closed them all in 1967 when a group of army colonels seized power, instituted censorship and mandated Government-friendly daily reports.         Because she was a cheerfully outspoken member of the right, anti-Communist rebels counted on her to back their coup and were shocked when she closed the high-circulation dailies.         They were even more disturbed when she openly mocked them in the Italian press, calling them "a circus," and commenting, "They can't tell me how to run newspapers anymore than I can tell them how to run their tanks."         Such wisecracks resulted in charges of "insulting authorities," and she was placed under house arrest in 1967. Although she faced several years in jail had she been brought to trial, she often made light of the situation in the press, and once said that were she ever imprisoned, she hoped it would be noted that her favorite dish was meatballs.         The same year, she made a daring escape from Athens to London that involved dying her hair black to match a fake passport and hiding out in a cramped bordello while her husband, Costas Loundras, tapped around their Athens flat in her high-heeled shoes to trick the guards into believing that she was still under their arrest.         From London she continued to aggressively pressure the government to lift restrictive policies against the press.         She returned home shortly after the junta fell in 1974, reopened her newspapers and was elected to Parliament as a member of the conservative New Democracy party. She published Kathimerini until 1987, when she sold her media holdings.         Ms. Vlachos was born in Athens on Dec. 18, 1911, and was sent abroad to be educated. When she returned to Greece, she went to work for her father as a bookkeeper, and became a reporter in 1935. During her career, she covered everything from Greek earthquakes to the Far East to Mussolini in Libya.         Her father, George, had already set a precedent for political opposition through the press -- he was jailed by a series of Greek Governments for his discourse, and refused to cooperate with Nazis when they took over one of his papers in 1941.         Ms. Vlachos chronicled her career and the adventure of her escape in her book "The House Arrest" (Gambit, 1970). In it she wrote: "The most thrilling aspect of this decision was that it was taken by the most conservative of men, by Costa, who with undue haste had drifted into middle age, silently condemning any kind of youthful flutter, choosing severe clothes, discouraging any tendency toward eccentricity, avoiding noisy parties, disliking on me anything conspicuous, insisting on my keeping my hair white."         Information about survivors was not available.       
         Thelma Griffith Haynes, a former co-owner of the Minnesota Twins, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 82.         She had been in poor health since suffering a stroke about 18 months ago, her son, Bruce, said.         Mrs. Haynes and her brother, Calvin Griffith, were raised by their uncle, Clark Griffith, because their parents were struggling financially and were later adopted by Griffith, a Hall of Fame pitcher who owned the Washington Senators.         Calvin Griffith became president of the franchise after Clark Griffith died and moved the team to Minnesota in 1961. Mrs. Haynes served as an executive vice president and assistant treasurer and each owned 26 percent of the team before it was sold to Carl Pohlad in 1985.         In addition to Calvin Griffith and her son, Mrs. Haynes is survived by two brothers and one sister.       
         Maxene Andrews, "the one on the left" in the trio of sisters whose string of hit songs in the 1940's made them the dominant radio voice of the home front and an inspiration to American servicemen, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, said her longtime manager, Lynda Wells.  Miss Andrews had recently completed a four-week engagement playing herself in the revue "Swingtime Canteen" at the Blue Angel in New York. Ms. Wells said that Miss Andrews had agreed to return to the show in December.         Miss Andrews was a teen-ager when she, her older sister, LaVerne, who died in 1967, and her younger sister, Patty, formed the trio whose close-voiced, enthusiastic style became the vocal parallel of the big bands of the swing era. They became stars almost overnight in 1937, singing English lyrics to the Yiddish song "Bei Mir Bist du Schon."         That success started the sisters on a long series of novelty hits that included "Ti-Pi-Tin," "Hold Tight," "The Jumping Jive," "Beer Barrel Polka," "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" and "Apple Blossom Time."         "The Beer Barrel Polka" was followed by "The Pennsylvania Polka" and "Strip Polka," while "Rhumboogie" started them on a series of boogie-woogie hits that included "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar" and "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy."         Their big hits during World War II were "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree" and "Rum and Coca-Cola."         To a nation at war, the Andrews Sisters became a cherished American institution. They could be heard on the radio, on jukeboxes and on movie soundtracks. They made numerous appearances at war bond rallies and they entertained troops, who seemed to regard them as the epitome of American innocence.         The innocence may have been even more authentic than it seemed. Miss Andrews said it was not until years later that she learned that the sly references to "working for the Yankee dollar" in "Rum and Coca-Cola" were suggestive of prostitution in Trinidad.         One of their few ballad hits was the song "I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time," which was recorded in 1940 and became Miss Andrews's personal favorite.         The sisters' singing style came naturally to them. "We couldn't read music," Maxene once explained. "But when we heard a song, we heard it in harmony."         Maxene, known as Mackie to her family and friends, was born on Jan. 3, 1916. She organized the trio in 1932, when she was 16. LaVerne was 21 and had been studying piano, while Patty, 14, was the tap-dance champion of Minneapolis, where the sisters were born. From the start, LaVerne was the low voice, Maxene the high voice and Patty the one in between.         From the late 1930's until the early 1940's, the Andrews Sisters sold more than 50 million records, appeared as themselves in 22 films and frequently teamed with Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller on their radio shows.         Although the public always saw the three sisters together, singing in close harmony, their private lives were studded with fallings-out. The group broke up in the early 1950's when Patty decided to become a solo performer. Maxene made her own debut as a solo act at that time at the Blue Angel but canceled after a few nights because she was still thinking in harmony terms. The sisters came together again very soon, however, and remained together until LaVerne's death.         In 1970 Maxene accepted the position of dean of women at Tahoe Paradise College in Lake Tahoe, Calif.         "I laughed when I was offered the position," she said. "All my life I'd been in show business. My schooling was the school of experience. But I had great rapport with young students."         In 1974 Maxene and Patty made their Broadway debuts in "Over Here." The show ran for more than a year, but after it closed, the two never sang together again.         Although they made a joint publicity appearance in 1987 when an Andrews Sisters star was added to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the two remained estranged, Ms. Wells said yesterday.         In recent years Miss Andrews had pursued an almost full-time career, lecturing, performing in concerts and at nightclubs and, more recently, in musicals. Earlier this year she appeared in "Follies," in Houston and Seattle.         Miss Andrews's marriage to Lou Levy, who managed the sister act, ended in divorce in 1951.         In addition to her sister, of Encino, Calif., Miss Andrews is survived by a daughter, Aleda Hunt, and a son, Peter Levy, both of Salt Lake City; by Ms. Wells, whom she adopted and who lived with her in Auburn, Calif.; Steve Sharpe of Los Angeles, whom she considered a foster son, and one grandchild.         Correction:  October 25, 1995, Wednesday         Subheadings for obituaries on Monday about the singer Maxene Andrews and the writer Kingsley Amis were reversed in some copies. The reference to "a onetime radical" applied to the obituary of Mr. Amis; the one to a "last role" in "a Manhattan revue" was for Miss Andrews's.       
         Simone Gallimard, a power in the French book-publishing world, died Monday in a clinic in Neuilly, a suburb of Paris. She was 77 and a longtime resident of Paris.         The cause was cancer, the Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Gallimard was the chief executive officer, with the title of president-director general, of the venerable Paris publishing house Mercure de France, which she had led since 1962. The house is known, among other things, for publishing works by prominent French writers and for printing French literary classics.         She was the widow of Claude Gallimard, a member of a distinguished French publishing family whom she married in 1939. Her father was a Government official, and her maiden name was Simone Cornu.         After working behind the scenes in publishing, she became the head of Mercure de France after it was purchased in 1958 by her father-in-law, Gaston Gallimard. Gaston Gallimard was the founder of the Parisian publishing house Editions Gallimard, which is now partly owned by the Gallimard family.         Mercure de France, founded in 1894, had published works by Proust and by the  poet Guillaume Apollinaire but went into a decline before Mrs. Gallimard took its helm. Under her leadership, it prospered and published books by such well-known French writers as the poet and man of letters Yves Bonnefoy, currently a visiting professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., and the poet Henri Michaux.         Mrs. Gallimard once confessed that "being a woman, bourgeois and inexperienced, I had a hard time" when she first took charge of the publishing house. But the French news agency Agence France-Presse, in reporting her death,  said that she was "the soul of Mercure de France for 33 years."         As chief executive officer, she played roles including, as Agence France-Presse put it, "editor, public relations person" and "discoverer of young authors."         She also became involved in a publishing furor. In 1975 she published a novel, "Life Before Us," which had been written, according to Agence France-Presse, by the French novelist Romain Gary using the pseudonym Emile Ajar, without her knowledge that it was a pseudonym. The book was translated into 23 languages, sold 1.3 million copies, won a French literary prize -- the Prix Goncourt -- and was made into the film "Madame Rosa."         Revelations about the novel's authorship embarrassed connoisseurs of literature who had failed to realize that Mr. Gary had written the book.         Mrs. Gallimard's survivors include her four children, Francoise, Christian, Antoine and Isabelle. Antoine and Isabelle Gallimard are executives of the publishing company.       
         Linda Goodman, whose down-to-earth insights into character traits were credited with bringing astrology out of the occult section and onto the best-seller lists with the 1968 publication of "Sun Signs," died on Saturday at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. She was about 70 and lived in Cripple Creek.         The hospital said the cause was complications of diabetes.         It may have been "the dawning of the age of Aquarius," as the 1960's song put it, but until Mrs. Goodman, a one-time newspaper reporter and sometime radio writer who had picked up an interest in astrology from grocery store booklets, sat down at her typewriter, the rays had not caused a blink in the publishing industry.         Within months after an obscure house named Taplinger brought out "Sun Signs," in 1968, it had become the first book on astrology to make The New York Times Best-Seller List.         Since then, her agent, Arthur Klebanoff, said yesterday, "Sun Signs," and two follow-up volumes, "Love Signs," (1978) and "Star Signs," (1988) have sold more than 30 million copies in 15 languages and continue to sell some 200,000 copies a year.         The $2.3 million paid for the paperback rights to "Love Signs" set an industry record.         What set Mrs. Goodman's books apart was a combination of her sharp insights and her elegant, accessible style.         Writing in the first person and drawing on the lives of celebrities, historical figures and personal friends to illustrate her points, Mrs. Goodman sometimes seemed more psychologist than astrologer.         Whether your sweetheart's streak of, say, stubbornness, came from the stars or childhood experiences, Mrs. Goodman was a master in elaborating how it would play out against your own tendencies as a dreamer.         Mrs. Goodman, whose original name was Mary Alice Kemery, was born in Morgantown, W. Va., on a date she gave as April 19 in a year she would never disclose.         "I once asked my grandfather, and he wouldn't tell me either," her son Michael Goodman said yesterday. During an interview a few years ago, Mrs. Goodman was more forthcoming, putting her age "between 435 and 450."         The date made her a triple Aries, and Mrs. Goodman, a five-foot-or-so dynamo fit the astrological profile to a T. "She was pushy," her son said.         A writer since childhood, Mrs. Goodman worked as an itinerant newspaper reporter, radio writer and occasional broadcaster. After reading "Letters from Linda" on a radio program, her son said, she adopted the name Linda.         Mrs. Goodman, whose early marriage to William Snyder ended in divorce, began writing "Sun Signs" in New York after an announcing job that had been promised her second husband, Sam Goodman, fell through.         Although her astrology has been called textbook as opposed to mystical, Mrs. Goodman developed a distinct mystic streak. "Star Signs," for example, draws on both numerology and reincarnation.         And when the New York authorities ruled that her 18-year-old daughter, Sarah Snyder, had committed suicide in 1973, Mrs. Goodman, citing her daughter's astrological chart among other evidence, refused to believe that the body identified by her husband was Sarah's.         She later spent so much time trying to find her daughter that she was forever running out of money, at one point living for several months on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral.         In addition to her son Michael, who is a resident of Keaau, Hawaii, she is survived by another son, William Snyder of Colorado Springs; a daughter, Jill Goodman, of Manchester, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Kate Witte Ericson, an artist who collaborated with her husband, Mel Ziegler, on indoor and outdoor installation works noted for their beauty, complexity and  social awareness, died on Sunday at her home in Milanville, Pa. She was 39 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was brain cancer, her husband said.         Ms. Ericson was born in Manhattan in 1955. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982. She and Mr. Ziegler met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy.         One of their first solo shows, at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1986, consisted of a display of all the wood necessary to raise a house,  with each piece carved with a phrase or adage about house or home. At the end of the exhibition, the wood was sold and used in the construction of a house.         Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler exhibited their work in many shows in the United  States and abroad, including the 1989 Whitney Biennial. Their most recent New York exhibition was in 1993 at the Michael Klein Gallery in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Ericson is survived by her parents, H. A. and Alma Ericson, of Norwalk, Conn., and a brother, Scott, of Arlington, Tex.       
         Marie Callender, a California woman who started baking pies at home for a delicatessen and turned that into a chain of 146 restaurants and a frozen-entree business, died on Saturday at the Rossmoor Regency Residential Community here. She was 88.         The cause was cancer.         Mrs. Callender got into the food business by chance, answering a delicatessen's help-wanted ad, then making pies for the business at home. The shop owner later persuaded her to start her own baking business and sell him pies.         She, her husband and son set up shop in Long Beach in a rented Quonset hut and began selling pies in 1948. Her only child, Donald Callender, sold the company to Ramada Inn in 1986, when it had annual sales of $175 million. About three-fourths of the restaurants are in California.         Mrs. Callender's husband died in 1984. She is survived by her son and three grandchildren.       
         Florence Greenberg, a one-time New Jersey housewife who parlayed an unlikely  hit record by a teen-age group known as the Shirelles into an improbable career  as the proprietor of a leading independent label of the 1960's, died on Thursday at the Hackensack University Medical Center. She was 82, and lived in Teaneck, N.J.         As a pioneering woman in the male-dominated world of rhythm-and-blues, Mrs. Greenberg was, by her own later account, a triple anomaly: "a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune."         Maybe so, but she had a finely tuned ear for popular music, a keen eye for talent and a driving ambition, all of which became increasingly apparent in the  1960's.         In addition to a series of hits by the Shirelles, among them "Dedicated to the One I Love," "Tonight's the Night," and Mrs. Greenberg's own composition, "Soldier Boy," her Scepter label produced such 1960's standards as "Louie, Louie," by the Kingsmen; "Twist and Shout," by the Isley Brothers, and "Walk on  By," by Dionne Warwick, not to mention "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," the  Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, sung by B. J. Thomas on the soundtrack of "Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which won an Academy Award in 1969.         Mrs. Greenberg traced her success to a day in 1957 when her 16-year-old daughter, Mary Jane, came home raving about the performance of four classmates at a Passaic High School assembly.         Their names were Shirley Alston, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner and Beverly Lee,  but they called themselves the Shirelles, and as soon as Mrs. Greenberg persuaded them to sing for her, she knew that their song, "I Met Him on a Sunday," had the makings of a hit.         A former Republican campaign worker who had translated her political skills into a job peddling songs for a local songwriters, Mrs. Greenberg, who had been  married to an accountant, had already become a familiar figure on Tin Pan Alley, hobnobbing with music-industry hopefuls at the old Turf restaurant on Broadway at 51st Street. She had also joined with two partners to form a label, Tiara Records.         The Tiara release of "I Met Him on a Sunday" was such an immediate success. Within months, Mrs.  Greenberg climbed so many radio-station stairs, sold so many records from the trunk of her car and created such demand that her company  could not handle the orders. So she sold the Shirelles' contract to Decca, an industry giant.         That might have been the end of her career, but, Decca, convinced that the Shirelles would be a one-hit phenomenon, returned the group to Mrs. Greenberg, who formed Scepter to replace Tiara.         Over the next decade, Scepter became an industry sensation as Mrs. Greenberg, whose company eventually occupied an entire floor of 1650 Broadway, repeatedly demonstrated her sure sense of talent.         This was never more evident than the day in 1962 when Mr. Bacharach played a  demonstration record of one of his songs for Mrs. Greenberg, and she told him that while she did not like the song she loved the singer.         The next day, Mr. Bacharach returned, saying he had a signed contract with the singer, a young woman named Dionne Warwick.         Partly because of the long line of hit Warwick releases that followed, Gulf & Western offered $6 million for Scepter in 1965, but Mrs. Greenberg declined to sell.         It was, she later said, a major mistake. Within a decade, as major labels came to dominate the distribution network, Scepter's success had faded, and by the time the company folded in 1977 Mrs. Greenberg had lost everything.         In recent years, Mrs. Greenberg had been cheered by Bette Midler's plans to make a movie of her life, but because Ms. Midler has been unable to secure the required rights from two of the three surviving Shirelles (Ms. Harris died in 1982), the project is dormant.         She is survived by her daughter, Mary Jane Goff of Upper Saddle River, N.J.;  a son, Stanley, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Butterfly McQueen, the actress best remembered for her portrayal of Prissy in "Gone With the Wind," the vexing slave girl who confounded Scarlett O'Hara with  the tearful pronouncement, "I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett," died yesterday. She was 84 years old.         Earlier in the day, Ms. McQueen was critically burned when a kerosene heater  in her one-bedroom cottage just outside Augusta, Ga., caught fire. She suffered  burns over 70 percent of her body and died at Augusta Regional Medical Center.         After appearing in the Civil War epic "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, Ms. McQueen's voice, squeaky and high-pitched, became her most remarked-upon characteristic, prompting one critic to describe it as a "clarinet with a cold"  and another to comment that it was an "itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension."         Although Ms. McQueen's role as Prissy earned her fame, it also brought her criticism in later years from people who considered the role stereotypical and demeaning.         "You know, today they call me an Uncle Thomasina," she said in 1970.         But Ms. McQueen, who devoted her later years to serving the African-American  community, said she also felt it necessary to acknowledge the history of black slavery in the United States.         "As I look back on "Gone with the Wind," for instance, I feel it is useful to have this authenticity," she once said. "We've got to know more about where we've come from. I wasn't too happy about the whole thing, but also later in life, as I looked around, I decided to take what I could get and then use it for what I want to do."         Born Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Fla., daughter of a housekeeper and a stevedore, Ms. McQueen first developed a fondness for acting as a child, when she would recite whole books of the Bible at home.         "All I knew as a child was church, church, church," she said.         When her parents separated, Ms. McQueen moved with her mother to Augusta, Ga., and then to New York City. As a teen-ager, she attended high school in Babylon, L.I., and later moved to Harlem.         After a brief stint in nursing school, Ms. McQueen pursued her acting career  in earnest, finding that the stage was much more exciting than a hospital. Her first break came in 1937 when George Abbott offered her a role in "Brown Sugar." The show was a flop, but Ms. McQueen signed on as a permanent member of the Abbott Acting Company.         It was during her years with the acting company that a friend dubbed her "Butterfly," after Ms. McQueen told her she had once danced a butterfly ballet in a performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."         Soon after, Mr. Abbott tailored a role for her in "What a Life," which she played on Broadway. One evening, during an intermission in Philadelphia, she received a contract from her agency for Prissy, a role she was initially rejected for after a talent scout called her too chubby. She received the good news with some reservation.         "I'd just come from a modern up-to-date integrated school in 'What a Life' and I couldn't understand why they'd want to bring back the 1800s," Ms. McQueen  said. "Most of my friends were progressive, going forward and looking forward. It was depressing for me."         Despite the success of "Gone With The Wind," Ms. McQueen found it increasingly difficult to find work in film and theater. She appeared in the films "Mildred Pierce" and "The Women," and on several radio shows. In 1951, she put on a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall, but she soon found she had to take on  other jobs to support herself. During the 1950's, she worked as a companion for  a woman in Long Island and sold toys at Macy's. At one time, she began her own radio show in Augusta, "to instill pride in the neighborhood," she said.         In 1966, still unable to find work as an actress, Ms. McQueen wrote a letter  to a Georgia congressman asking him for help in getting a job.         But it was upon her return to Harlem one year later that she found a second vocation -- helping her community. She plunged into antipoverty work and took a  job as a waitress in a soul food restaurant.         Fond of children, she worked at the Mount Morris Park Recreation Center as a  receptionist. Her distinctive voice could be heard through the corridors as she  gave tap dance and ballet lessons. She defined herself at the time through her commitment to the "black family," she said.         Ever restless and determined, Ms. McQueen, who had never completed college, graduated with a degree in political science from City College in 1975 at the age of 64.       
         Connie Boucher, a pioneer in licensing cartoon characters who provided the inspiration for "Happiness Is a Warm Puppy," a best-selling 1962 book about Snoopy, the "Peanuts" comic strip character, died on Dec. 20 in San Francisco of complications after heart surgery. She was 72.         Ms. Boucher was a window dresser for I. Magnin, a San Francisco Bay area women's clothier, in 1959 when she grew dissatisfied with the quality of coloring books available for her two sons. With her husband, Jim Young, she created a Winnie-the-Pooh coloring book, using a character that was in the public domain. The book sold 50,000 copies.         Two years later, she founded Determined Productions Inc. to develop other products based on licensing characters. One of her first efforts was a calendar  using the characters in the "Peanuts" comic strip.         "What made her different was the quality and originality of her ideas," Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist, said yesterday. "She proposed the date book in 1961, and now everyone is doing them. After that, she started doing sweatshirts and banners and all that. She kind of set a standard for licensing,  which up until she came along had not always been that high."         Mr. Schulz said that the second year's calendar sold twice as well and that they began discussing his desire to publish books using Charlie Brown and other  characters. Until then, he said, publishers had been interested only in reprints of his comic strips.         "She had seen the strip I had drawn where Snoopy is being hugged by Charlie Brown and Charlie Brown says, 'Happiness is a warm puppy,' " Mr. Schulz said. "Connie said that maybe this could become a good book, and I said I didn't know  if I could think of any more of those ideas. That day, after she left, I wrote virtually all the ideas in 'Happiness Is a Warm Puppy' and it was the best-selling book the next year."         The book spent 45 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, reaching No.  2.         Five years ago, Ms. Boucher's company helped underwrite a show at the Louvre  in Paris celebrating 40 years of Snoopy.         In recent years, Ms. Boucher turned her attention to conservation issues. She helped arrange product licensing to benefit the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations. She was also nominated for an Academy Award for producing "Amazon Diary," a short live-action film, a spokeswoman for her company, Jaymi Horn, said.         In addition to her husband and business partner, Ms. Boucher is survived by a sister, June Dutton of Sausalito, Calif; two sons, Douglas, of Belvedere, Calif., and Theodore, of Davis, Calif., and five grandchildren.       
         Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.         Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.         Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing.  "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.         She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.         In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.       
         Vera Maxwell, one of a legendary group of American sportswear designers who came to prominence in the 1940's, died on Sunday in Rincon, P.R., at the home of her grandson, Douglas Maxwell.         She was 93 and died after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Rhea Maxwell.         One of the pioneers of women's sportswear along with Claire McCardell, Clare Potter, Carolyn Schnurer and Tina Leser, Vera Maxwell continued to design clothes that were casual, comfortable and classic until her retirement in 1985.         Among her innovations was the "weekend wardrobe" of 1935 that consisted of two jackets, two skirts and a pair of trousers; the wraparound jersey blouse; the riding jacket suit and the fencing suit. In the 1940's she designed a cotton coverall uniform for war workers at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation that was a forerunner of the jump suit. She was also the first American designer to make clothes of Ultrasuede.         She won the Coty American Fashion Critics' Award in 1953 and was honored in 1970 with a retrospective exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. In 1980 there was another retrospective, this time at the Museum of the City of New York, which opened with a party attended by Princess Grace of Monaco and her daughter Princess Caroline. Mrs. Maxwell had met the former Grace Kelly in Dallas in 1955 when they were both there to receive Neiman Marcus Awards, and she frequently visited her and Prince Rainier in Monaco.         Born Vera Huppe in New York City on April 22, 1901, of Viennese parents, she traveled to Europe with them as a child and lived for a while in Vienna. She attended high school in Leonia, N.J., and studied ballet in New York, becoming a member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1919. She danced with the company until her marriage in 1924 to Raymond J. Maxwell, who worked on Wall Street. They were divorced in 1937. She married Carlisle H. Johnson, an architect, in 1938 and divorced him in 1945.         While married to Mr. Maxwell, she had started to model on Seventh Avenue and developed an interest in making clothes. She studied tailoring in London and worked as a designer for several American sportswear houses including Adler and Adler, Glenhunt and Max Milstein. (In 1970, Mrs. Maxwell formed a business partnership with Mr. Milstein's nephew Morton Milstein.)         Mrs. Maxwell became known as a designer in the 1930's when American fashion was struggling to be born and most designers toiled anonymously. She achieved fame with such designs as a weekend wardrobe of a collarless jacket with four patch pockets that she made in tweed and in gray flannel to be mixed and matched with a short pleated flannel tennis skirt, a longer tweed skirt with pressed-down pleats and a pair of flannel cuffed trousers -- all designs so classic they could still be worn today.         Following the precepts of her idol, Coco Chanel, Mrs. Maxwell devoted herself to making timeless clothes that women could move around in. In 1975, she showed what she called a "speed suit," which was actually a pull-on dress with a stretch top and no zippers, buttons, snaps or ties. A woman could slip it on in seconds.         After years of designing for other manufacturers, Mrs. Maxwell founded her own company, Vera Maxwell Originals, in 1947. Her heyday was in the 1950's when her easy-to-wear styles attracted customers like Pat Nixon, Martha Graham and Lillian Gish. By 1960 her clothes were being sold in 700 stores around the country. In the 60's, her star waned as fashion's attention shifted to swinging London designers like Mary Quant and Zandra Rhodes.         In 1964, Mrs. Maxwell showed a collection of American Indian-inspired clothing that failed to find an audience. "It bombed," she said in an interview that appeared in The New York Times in 1970. "So I decided to lie fallow for a while."         She resurfaced in 1970 with a collection that was introduced at a tea in B. Altman's. Until her retirement, she continued to turn out the tasteful classic suits, coats and dresses that her loyal customers would wear for years.         She made a brief comeback as a consultant to a knitwear company but spent most of her time working on her memoirs. They have never been published, her daughter-in-law said, partly because "people wanted gossip about Grace Kelly, but she wouldn't write that."         She sold her Manhattan apartment three years ago and retired to Gilgo Beach, L.I., with her son, Dr. R. John Maxwell, and daughter-in-law and spent winters in Rincon with them and her grandson. She is also survived by her granddaughter, Sarah Maxwell of Santa Fe, N.M., and a great-granddaughter, Isabel Maxwell.       
         Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said.         Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.         She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.         Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."         When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.         The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."         Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."         Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.         In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.         Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.         Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.         Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Ellen Sulzberger Straus, who was active in Call for Action and other nonprofit organizations and in the communications industry, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, R. Peter Straus.         At her death, Mrs. Straus was president of Executive Service Strategies, a management and consulting firm that she founded in 1986. She and Mr. Straus were for some years co-owners of WMCA, a Manhattan-based radio station, which they sold in 1986.         In 1963, Mrs. Straus founded Call for Action, the nation's first telephone help line, which was intended to aid individuals in solving their problems with officials, corporations and landlords. That activity, using office space at WMCA, became the prototype for similar organizations in nearly all major United States cities.         Mrs. Straus was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College in 1945. She worked as the executive secretary of the New York League of Women Voters and on the staff of the Atomic Energy Commission, becoming assistant director of public information. In 1949, she helped to manage Gov. Herbert H. Lehman's campaign for the United States Senate.         Later, based in Switzerland while Mr. Straus was an executive with the International Labor Organization, she worked as a Geneva correspondent for several upstate newspapers.         In addition to her husband of 45 years, who is chairman of Straus Communications, Mrs. Straus is survived by her mother, Louise Mayer Blumenthal Sulzberger of Longboat Key, Fla., and Saranac Lake, N.Y.; four children, Diane Tucker of Bedford, N.Y., Katherine Caple of Wellesley, Mass., Jeanne Tofel of Manhattan and Eric Straus of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; two sisters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann Sand, both of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Selena, the 23-year-old reigning queen of the Tejano music world, was shot and killed today at a Corpus Christi motel.         Shortly after 9:30 P.M. a 32-year-old woman identified by the young singer's father as the former president of her fan club abruptly surrendered after keeping the police at bay for nearly 10 hours as she sat in a red pickup truck in the motel parking lot with a gun pointed at her temple.         Hundreds of people who had congregated in the cold drizzle watched as she was rushed off in a police car, surrounded by officers.         The killing of the star, who had won a Grammy music award last year and whose recording "Amor Prohibido" ("Forbidden Love") sold 400,000 copies in the United States and many more than that in Mexico, stunned her fans and prompted almost non-stop coverage on Spanish-language radio and television stations here, in Texas's major cities and all along the Mexican border. Many of the stations took calls from distraught listeners and played Selena's songs throughout the day.         The surrender came in a surreal scene with a crowd of reporters, television camera operators and onlookers gathered at an Exxon gas station across the street from the Days Inn motel just off a stretch of Interstate 37 near the Corpus Christi airport. Hundreds of fans, including many weeping teen-agers, converged on the scene throughout the day, a few with tape machines that played recordings of Selena's songs as reporters' beepers and cellular phones rang almost constantly.         Police identified the suspect as Yolanda Saldivar and said they would charge her on Saturday. The singer's father, Abraham Quintanilla, said Ms. Saldivar was a former head of the Selena fan club who three weeks ago was fired from her job at the family's clothing boutique here, Selena, Etc. The stores are due to expand to San Antonio and Mexico in coming months.         "There have been discrepancies," Mr. Quintanilla told reporters at the hospital where his daughter died this afternoon, two hours after she was shot. "And they resulted in her shooting Selena."         Mr. Quintanilla described Ms. Saldivar as a "disgruntled employee" who was fired after money was discovered to be missing from the store. He said that Selena had demanded that the woman return financial documents about the company and that the two women had agreed to meet at the motel.         With her pouting smile, suggestive clothing and theatrical command of a microphone, Selena was often described as the Madonna of the Mexican-American world and was an idol and heartthrob on both sides of the border. Unlike Madonna, though, she also cultivated an image as a cheerful promoter of family values. She was married to Chris Perez, the lead guitarist in her band, Selena y los Dinos.         Tejano music, which has roots both in the oompah music of European settlers in Texas and in Mexican ballads, is a fast-paced mix of accordion, guitars and lyrics in both English and Spanish.         It is hugely popular in South Texas and elsewhere along the border. The recent Tejano Music Awards in San Antonio, which has become a sort of Nashville of the Tejano world, was attended by 45,000 fans. At the ceremonies, Selena walked away with awards for female entertainer of the year, female vocalist of the year, best record of the year and best album. Her "Selena Live" also won the Grammy last year for best Mexican-American album.         "It's got polka in it, a little bit of country, a little bit of jazz," she said in an interview last year with the San Jose Mercury News. "Fuse all those types of music together. I think that's where you get Tejano."         Selena's hit "Fotos y Recuerdos" ("Photographs and Memories") is No. 4 on Billboard Magazine's Latin chart this week.         An assistant police chief in Corpus Christi, Ken Bung, said that Selena, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla Perez, was shot in a room at the motel just before noon and stumbled to the lobby. She was rushed to the Memorial Medical Center and pronounced dead about an hour later.         Born in Lake Jackson, near Houston, on April 16, 1971, Selena began singing with her father's band at age 3. The family later moved to Corpus Christi where she became well-known in local music circles by her teen-age years and eventually became a widely known star.         At the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a traditional celebration that turns America's fourth-largest city into a cowtown once a year, Selena was the largest-selling draw this year.         "We had 20 performances this year," said Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show. "We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome."         A concert video made of her performance is to air shortly in Mexico and on some Spanish-language stations in Texas.         Maria Aguirre, a receptionist at KQQK, a popular Tejano music station in Houston, said the switchboard had been flooded with calls since the death was first announced.         "Basically they are just in awe," Ms. Aguirre said. "They cannot believe that it happened. They're calling to reconfirm."         For Tejano fans, she added, "It's almost like the feeling when John Lennon died. She was the queen of Tejano."         Mr. Shafer said: "This lady was destined to be an international superstar. In many aspects she already was. She could sell out any pavilion in South Texas. She was on her way to standing beside Madonna."         In Mexico, her popularity was limited more to the northern border region, within what Mexicans call the onda grupera, or "group wave," a movement of norteno or "ranchera" pop groups that travel the northern and central states of the country, playing dances in the towns and concerts in the cities.         Selena's father had toured nightclubs across Texas in the 1960's with the original version of Los Dinos but did not achieve wide success until he made young Selena, with her belting vocal power, the lead singer. "I think he saw dollar signs," Selena said laughingly in an interview last year, describing the evolution of a family band that included her sister Suzette on drums and her brother Abraham III on guitar.         Industry experts estimated that the shooting would only ripen Selena's celebrity as the Tejano queen who was about to break through to a larger public with her first English language album as well as her first movie role in the forthcoming "Don Juan DeMarco."         "That album was going to open a lot of doors," said John Ortiz, promotion representative for EMI Latin Records. "It will be a great loss. Shewas involved in many things."
