Marion Hutton, a vocalist with the Glenn Miller Orchestra who for the last 20 years worked to help rehabilitate female alcoholics, died of cancer Saturday at her home in Kirkland, Wash. She was 67 years old.         Miss Hutton sang with the Miller band from 1939 until the band leader joined the United States Army Air Corps in World War II. Songs she was identified with included ''Kalamazoo,'' ''Chatanooga Choo Choo,'' ''Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree,'' 'Moonlight Serenade'' and ''I'll Be Seeing You.''         She acted in movies including ''Love Happy'' with the Marx Brothers, ''In Society'' with the comedy team of Abbott and Costello, and others with Perry Como, Bob Hope and Jack Carson.         In 1965 she sought treatment for alcoholism and addiction to certain prescription drugs. Thereafter she devoted her energies to helping alcoholics and establishing treatment programs in California prisons. In 1981 she founded Residence XII, a treatment center for female alcoholics in Kirkland, and was its executive director.         Miss Hutton is survived by her husband, Victor Schoen; three sons, and her sister, Betty Hutton, the actress and singer.

Helen Tubbs, a cafe singer of the 1940's and 50's and the director of the Soldier's, Sailor's and Airmen's Club, a charitable organization, died on Dec. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She was born in Minneapolis on March 14, 1909. She studied singing in Minneapolis and then moved to Hollywood, where she worked as an actress. She was the Rome correspondent for Variety from 1949 to 1954. With her husband, the late actor William Tubbs, she was an important part of a postwar film colony in Rome that included Ingrid Bergman, Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica and others.         There are no survivors.       
        Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.''         In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly.         She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck         Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success.         With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.''         The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy.         Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own         According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948.         When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices.         During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies.         After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985.         Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.       
        Irene Handl, one of Britain's best-loved actresses and comediennes, who perfected the role of a slightly eccentric cockney old lady, died today at her home here, according to her agent, Peter Graham. She was 85 years old.         Irene Handl, one of Britain's best-loved actresses and comediennes, who perfected the role of a slightly eccentric cockney old lady, died today at her home here, according to her agent, Peter Graham. She was 85 years old.         Born in London the daughter of a Viennese father and a French mother, Miss Handl took up acting when she was 36 and over the years appeared in stage plays, films and television comedies as well as becoming an accomplished writer.         Her films included ''Doctor in Love,'' ''The French Mistress'' and ''The Belles of St. Trinians.''         She became well-known in Britain for appearances in television shows including ''Hancock's Half Hour,'' ''You Must Be Joking,'' ''For the Love of Ada'' and, most recently, ''Never Say Die.''         She continued working as a television actress until her death.       
        Olga Bellin, a veteran stage, film and television actress, died Sunday of cancer. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Olga Bellin, a veteran stage, film and television actress, died Sunday of cancer. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Bellin's last stage appearance was at the American Place Theater in 1984 when her husband, Paul Roebling, directed her in ''Zelda,'' by William Luce, a one-woman play about the wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Last year she appeared in a CBS television series, ''The Equalizer.''         Acting professionally for more than 30 years, Ms. Bellin performed on and off Broadway, on live television dramas, soap operas and adventure series, and in films. She starred with Robert Duvall in the movie ''Tomorrow'' in 1972.         Ms. Bellin is survived by her husband and her son, Kristian.       
        Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         Diana Sheean, an author and the widow of Vincent Sheean, died of a stroke complicated by pneumonia at St. Stephen's Hospital in London last Wednesday. She was 72 years old.         The daughter of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson and Lady Gertrude Forbes-Robertson, a well-known actor and actress, Mrs. Sheean was born in London and spent most of her childhood in Kent, near the cliffs of Dover. ''There the great events of the village,'' she recalled, ''were the arrivals of Channel swimmers and German mines, which still washed up on the beach from time to time.''         Mrs. Sheean, whose nickname was Dinah, wrote several books, including ''The Battle of Waterloo Road'' (1941), illustrated by Robert Capa's photographs, about the people in Britain during the war; ''War Letters From Britain'' (1941), edited with Roger W. Straus Jr.; ''A Cat and a King'' (1949), a novel about the theater, and ''My Aunt Maxine'' (1964), a biography of her aunt, Maxine Elliott, the American actress. #3 Plays 'Fizzed Out'         She was educated at boarding schools and at a French school in London, and she lived for several months with a family in Vienna. Her only connection with the theater, aside from the involvement of her parents, was writing three plays that, in her words, ''fizzed out.''         In 1935 she married Vincent Sheean, the noted American foreign correspondent, whose book ''Personal History'' was published to great success that year. They traveled widely in Spain, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Europe before settling in the United States.         During those travels Mrs. Sheean wrote dispatches to The New York Herald Tribune, and before and during World War II she was active in committees raising money and distributing food for Spanish refugee children and victims of Nazism.         The Sheeans were divorced in 1946 and remarried in 1949.         Mrs. Sheean is survived by two daughters, Linda, of New York City, and Ellen, of London.       
        Mary Ruby Orkin, who in her 60's became known for her primitive paintings of Central Park, died on Sunday at Kateri Residence, a nursing home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         Mary Ruby Orkin, who in her 60's became known for her primitive paintings of Central Park, died on Sunday at Kateri Residence, a nursing home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Orkin, who was born in Brooklyn, worked in vaudeville and as a silent screen actress in Hollywood through the early 1920's. She was a piano teacher in Los Angeles until the 1940's, after which she returned to New York. She turned to painting in the early 1960's after becoming hard of hearing.         Her works were widely reproduced in magazines and were shown in several New York gallery exhbitions, including shows at the Park South Gallery in 1971, and at the Witkin Gallery in 1981. The latter was a joint exhibition with her daughter, the photographer Ruth Orkin, who was best-known for her photographs of Central Park before her death in 1985.         There were no immdiate survivors.       
        Catharine Sargent Huntington, an actress, director and producer and a manager of the Provincetown Playhouse on the Wharf on Cape Cod, Mass., died Friday at Sherrill House, a Boston nursing home where she had lived for several years. She was 100 years old.         Catharine Sargent Huntington, an actress, director and producer and a manager of the Provincetown Playhouse on the Wharf on Cape Cod, Mass., died Friday at Sherrill House, a Boston nursing home where she had lived for several years. She was 100 years old.         Miss Huntington stage career spanned six decades, lasting until she was 86.         She was an enthusiastic supporter of Eugene O'Neill, and an O'Neill drama opened each summer season during her stewarship of the Playhouse. In the O'Neill Festival there in 1966, 10 of his plays were presented.         In 1965, Miss Huntington was awarded the Rodgers and Hammerstein Award for having done most in the Boston area for the American theater.         She helped found the Boston Stage Society in 1922 and the New England Repertory Theater in 1938.         Miss Huntington owned the Provincetown Playhouse on the Wharf from 1940 to 1973. This structure replaced the original playhouse that existed from 1915 to 1924. The second playhouse was destroyed by fire in 1977.       
        Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Miss Greenwood's son, Jason Morrell, said his mother was found dead Saturday by friends she had invited to dinner. Mr. Morrell did not give a cause of his mother's death, but a BBC news report said she had apparently suffered a heart attack.         Miss Greenwood appeared on stage only two weeks ago in a sketch with Robert Morley at the Prince of Wales Theater in London. Mr. Morrell said his mother had not been ill recently.         Known primarily as a comic actress, Miss Greenwood starred in a series of British films in the 1940's and 50's that are now considered classics.         One of her frequent co-stars was Sir Alec Guinness, with whom she made ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' ''The Man in the White Suit'' and ''The Detective,'' a movie based on G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown books. In Film Version of 'Ernest'         Miss Greenwood also appeared with Michael Redgrave in the film version of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Ernest'' and with Basil Rathbone in ''Tight Little Island,'' a screen adaptation of Compton Mackenzie's novel ''Whiskey Galore.''         Miss Greenwood, born in the Chelsea section of London on March 4, 1921, was the daughter of Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood, an artist. She began taking dancing lessons when she was 8 years old, studied at St. Catherine's School in Surrey, and continued to take ballet lessons until she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at 17.         Her first stage appearance came at age 18 when she appeared as Louisa in Moliere's ''Malade Imaginaire'' at the Apollo Theater in London. Performances in ''Little Ladyship'' and ''The Women'' followed.         Leslie Howard saw her in ''The Women'' and made Miss Greenwood his leading lady in the film ''The Gentle Sex.'' From then on Miss Greenwood alternated film and stage work.         She appeared in the role of Wendy in ''Peter Pan'' and as Elie Dunn in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House,'' then undertook more serious roles, playing Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' with the Donald Wolfit company, Nora in Ibsen's ''Doll House,'' Celia in ''Volpone'' and Sabina in ''The Young Wives' Tale.'' Developed a Following         Her film career rocketed with the success of ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' and Miss Greenwood gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. She appeared on Broadway with Claude Rains in 1953 in T. S. Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.''         Miss Greenwood's career had recently revived with appearances in several British television series. Her son said yesterday: ''She enjoyed doing all the recent TV work. She kept a trueness to herself. If she didn't want to do something, she wouldn't do it.''         Miss Greenwood was married in 1960 to the actor Andre Morrell, who died in 1978. She is survived by her son.         Correction:  March 19, 1987, Thursday, Late City Final Edition       
        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.       
        Hermione Gingold, the irrepressible English-born comedienne whose tart, quick-witted repartee became her trademark, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived on the East Side.         Hermione Gingold, the irrepressible English-born comedienne whose tart, quick-witted repartee became her trademark, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived on the East Side.         Miss Gingold conquered Broadway in 1953 as the star of the long-running revue ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac''; she last appeared on Broadway as the narrator in Stephen Sondheim's musical entertainment ''Side by Side by Sondheim'' in 1977-78.         To a wider American public she was known as a rambunctious, ribald conversationalist on talk shows, a longtime ''irregular regular'' on ''The Jack Paar Show'' whose rejoinders more recently delighted audiences of the talk-show host Merv Griffin.         Her throaty voice is remembered from Alan Jay Lerner's movie musical ''Gigi'' (1958), in which she and Maurice Chevalier joined in the duet ''I Remember It Well.'' Miss Gingold portrayed a retired courtesan, the scheming grandmother of Leslie Caron.         She also appeared in ''The Music Man'' (1962), as the mayor's wife; ''Bell, Book and Candle'' (1958); again with Mr. Chevalier in ''I'd Rather Be Rich'' (1964), and as Mme. Armfeldt in both the stage and film versions of ''A Little Night Music,'' Mr. Sondheim's musical comedy based on Ingmar Bergman's ''Smiles of a Summer Night.'' In Wartime Revue         Miss Gingold began her career in 1911 as a child actor with Noel Coward in ''Where the Rainbow Ends.'' She acted in Shakespearean plays at the Old Vic.         But thousands of servicemen came to admire her as a comedienne in the long-running London revue ''Sweet and Low.'' Several attempts to extend her career to Broadway, one of them involving Cole Porter, failed in the best theater tradition.         Miss Gingold had her first acting engagement in this country at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., in March 1951. The vehicle was ''It's About Time,'' an intimate revue that incorporated some of her material from London.         The title proved prophetic, for '' John Murray Anderson's Almanac'' made her an instant Broadway favorite when it opened in December 1953. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it the ''funniest revue Broadway has played host to for a long time.'' Mr. Atkinson singled out one of her skits with Billy De Wolfe, in which ''Miss Gingold and Mr. De Wolfe act like a couple of geniuses.''         ''It seems like a long time since anyone acted a revue sketch with as much craft and subtlety,'' he said. ''Almanac'' ran for 227 performances, and Miss Gingold won the Donaldson Award in 1954 for her performance.         Miss Gingold acted on the straw-hat theater circuit in summer with, among others plays, Terence Rattigan's ''Sleeping Prince'' and one of her earlier London successes, Noel Coward's ''Fallen Angels.''         Another one of her roles, both on Broadway and in summer stock, was that of the fastidious mother in Arthur Kopit's ''Oh, Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad.'' 'I'm a Celebrity'         She was a tall, vibrant woman with a mobile face, large, heavy-lidded blue eyes and tousled blond hair. She delighted in television, and one of her funniest moments came on a show when she was asked whether her most recent husband was dead. ''That's a matter of opinion,'' she replied.         ''Fighting is essentially a masculine idea,'' she observed on another occasion. ''A woman's weapon is her tongue.''         On the eve of her 80th birthday, while in the cast of ''Side by Side,'' she ruefully reflected that she had always wanted to be in ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''Hamlet.'' She said: ''The trouble with me is that I'm not considered an actress anymore. I'm a celebrity.''         At 66, asked about retirement, Miss Gingold said, ''I suppose I shall drop dead in the theater, to a full house, I hope.''         Miss Gingold participated in benefits and fund raisers for causes ranging from the theater to cancer research. She wrote articles and revue sketches, a play, ''Abracadabra,' as well as a tongue-in-cheek autobiography, ''The World Is Square: My Own Unaided Work.''         Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold was born in London to an English mother and an Austrian father. She was privately educated in London and Paris.         Among her survivors are a sister and two grandchildren, all of Britain.

Dalida, an Egyptian-born singer and actress who first won fame in France for her song ''Bambino'' in 1954, was found dead Sunday from an apparent overdose of barbiturates, according to family members. She was 54 years old.         Dalida, whose real name was Yolande Gigliotti, was born in 1933 and was an entertainment success in Europe and the Middle East for more than 30 years. Her records sold more than 85 million copies and her repertory included more than 400 songs in French, 200 in Italian and 200 in other languages. Her father, Pietro Gigliotti, was a violinist with the Cairo Opera.       
        Cathryn Damon, a stage and television actress who won an Emmy for her role on the popular television spoof ''Soap,'' died of cancer Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 56 years old.         Cathryn Damon, a stage and television actress who won an Emmy for her role on the popular television spoof ''Soap,'' died of cancer Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 56 years old.         Miss Damon was best known to millions of fans as Mary Campbell, the loyal wife of Burt Campbell, on the zany satire of daytime soap operas that ran on ABC from 1977-81.         The series had a loosely structured plot line that sometimes startled viewers with references to incest, adultery and homosexuality.         Miss Damon's character had to deal with a television husband who once was cloned by aliens from outer space. Both Miss Damon and Richard Mulligan, who played Burt, won Emmys in 1980 for their performances in the show. The problem-plagued television family also consisted of a son who became involved in organized crime and another son who was bisexual.         The series was so controversial that it brought 32,000 letters of protest even before ABC put it on the air. But ''Soap'' attracted a large and loyal following and ABC contended the program represented a major revolution in television comedy.         Miss Damon worked until shortly before her illness incapacitated her. Acted on Broadway         On television she was seen in the ''Matlock,'' ''Mike Hammer'' and ''Murder, She Wrote'' series. Earlier she was a neighbor on ''Webster'' and was featured in a television movie ''Not in Front of the Children.''         On Broadway and Off Broadway Miss Damon appeared in ''Flora, the Red Menace,'' ''Prisoner of Second Avenue,'' ''The Last of the Red Hot Lovers,'' ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' ''The Boys From Syracuse'' and ''Passion.''         Survivors include her mother, M. Cathryn Springer, and a sister, June Ferol Damon.         CATHRYN DAMON DEAD AT 56

        Elizabeth Hartman, who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress in 1966 for her role in ''A Patch of Blue,'' died in a fall from her fifth-floor apartment in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.         Elizabeth Hartman, who was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress in 1966 for her role in ''A Patch of Blue,'' died in a fall from her fifth-floor apartment in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.         According to the Pittsburgh police, Miss Hartman, who was 45 years old, had called her doctor a short time earlier, saying she was depressed. They listed her death as a possible suicide.         Miss Hartman enjoyed sudden success as a film actress following her ''Patch'' role and Academy Award nomination, but her career declined in succeeding years.         ''That initial success beat me down,'' Miss Hartman, a tense, fragile-looking redhead, said in a 1969 interview. ''It spiraled me into a position where I didn't belong. I was not ready for that. I suddenly found myself failing.''         She said she sat around her East 68th Street apartment for two years doing nothing but reading and brooding. Her mood finally lifted with her debut on Broadway in the role of Emily in a revival of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town.''         She had major roles in ''The Group,'' ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and ''The Fixer.'' She co-starred with Clint Eastwood in ''The Beguiled'' in 1971 and was in ''Walking Tall'' in 1973..       
        Madge Kennedy, a stage and silent film star in the early part of the century, died of respiratory failure Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 96 years old and lived in Hollywood.         Madge Kennedy, a stage and silent film star in the early part of the century, died of respiratory failure Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 96 years old and lived in Hollywood.         Miss Kennedy was born in Chicago and raised in California. At age 18, she came to New York to study art and joined the Art Students League. A role in an amateur production of a play landed her the female lead in ''The Genius,'' and she stayed an actress.         Her Broadway debut was in ''Little Miss Brown'' in 1912. After two more stage comedies, ''Twin Beds'' and ''Fair and Warmer,'' she turned to motion pictures in 1916. Among the silent films in which she starred were ''Baby Mine,'' ''Trimmed in Red,'' ''Bad Company,'' ''Lying Wives'' and ''Oh Baby.''         She left motion pictures in 1926 but continued to act on stage for the next 25 years. She took over from Gertrude Lawrence in Noel Coward's ''Private Lives'' in 1931. She returned to films in 1952 to make her debut in talking pictures in ''The Marrying Kind,'' starring Judy Holliday.         Some of Miss Kennedy's later films were ''Day of the Locust,'' ''North by Northwest'' and ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' Her last movie was ''Marathon Man'' in 1976.         On television, she played in such series as ''Leave It to Beaver,'' ''The Twilight Zone'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.''         She has no immediate survivors.       
        Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Miss Page, who had been performing in ''Blithe Spirit'' on Broadway since spring, did not arrive for Saturday's two performances. At the end of the evening show, the play's producer, Karl Allison, announced that she had died. Her role in ''Blithe Spirit'' was assumed by her understudy, Patricia Conolly.         Mr. Allison described the other members of the cast as devastated by the news. ''She was such a wonderfully sweet person, on top of being such an extraordinary actress,'' he said.         Born in Kirksville, Mo., on Nov. 22, 1924, Miss Page grew up in Chicago and later traced her love of acting to plays that she had done with a church youth group. 'To Be Good at Something'         ''I always wanted to be good at something, to be somebody,'' she once wrote in a sketch of herself for The New Yorker. ''The minute I got into my first play, which was called ''Excuse My Dust'' - I was 17 at the time - I knew that this was what I'd been looking for.''         After graduating from high school in 1942, Miss Page spent three years studying at the Goodman Theater School in Chicago. With 11 other students - they each chipped in $35 - she formed a stock theater company that operated for four seasons from a playhouse outside the city.         In the late 1940's, Miss Page moved to New York, where she worked as a hat-check girl, a spool winder in a thread factory and a negligee model while stalking the theater district for work.         ''The first rule of survival was to stretch every penny,'' she once said. ''I'd eat in a restaurant that featured soup and free rolls for 15 cents and I'd stuff my pockets with rolls. Fortunately, food didn't mean much to me.'' First Big Break in '52         Her first big acting break came in 1952, when the director Jose Quintero cast her as the lovelorn Alma Winemiller in his production of Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' which played Off Broadway at the Circle in the Square.         In that role, she attracted such praise that the next year she made her Broadway debut, in ''Midsummer'' by Vina Delmar. Though the show received mediocre reviews, the critics once again raved about Miss Page, and the producers raised her to star billing.         On Broadway, she went on to star in ''The Immoralist'' in 1954, an adaption of the Gide novel; in N. Richard Nash's ''Rainmaker,'' also in 1954, and in Williams's ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' in 1959.         More recently, she appeared in John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God'' in 1982, and Off Broadway in Sam Shepard's ''Lie of the Mind'' in 1985.         Miss Page was perhaps best known for her interpretations of Williams's obsessive heroines. In 1980 she played Zelda Fitzgerald in the Williams drama ''Clothes for a Summer Hotel.'' 'Disciplined and Dedicated'         The playwright once described her as ''the most disciplined and dedicated of actresses.''         She rejected another characterization of her - as an actress best suited to the roles of neurotic women. ''It's a myth based on nothing,'' she said.         ''A lot of people say I always play neurotic women,'' she said. ''Well, who doesn't play neurotic women?''         The career of Miss Page, who shunned many of the trappings of stardom, was marked by periods of relative obscurity broken by sudden rediscovery. In 1962, with the release of the film versions of ''Summer and Smoke'' and ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' she found herself, after 10 years on the stage, being hailed as an ''overnight success.''         ''That's the longest night I've ever seen,'' she said at the time.         Miss Page's film credits included ''Hondo,'' in which she played opposite John Wayne, in 1954; ''The Happiest Millionaire'' in 1967, and ''The Day of the Locust'' in 1975. In recent years, she appeared in ''The Pope of Greenwich Village'' in 1984 and ''The Trip to Bountiful'' in 1985. A Belated Oscar         Nominated for an Oscar eight times without winning, Miss Page finally received the award for best actress for her performance in ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' In the movie, she played Carrie Watts, an old woman who finally fulfills her long desire to return to her childhood home of Bountiful, a Texas town that has by then disappeared. Of her performance, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''As Mrs. Watts, Geraldine Page has never been in better form or in more control of that complex, delicate mechanism that makes her one of our finest actresses.''         ''She was not a gal who worried about the fashion of the times,'' said the playwright, Horton Foote, a longtime friend of the actress and the author of the screenplay for ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' ''She had enormous individuality. She just wasn't a theater provincial and her work reflected that.''         In the New Yorker sketch, Miss Page gave her own views on what makes a successful actor: ''The main thing is the ability to control your instrument, which in the actor, is yourself. Look the way you want the character to look. Sound the way you want the character to sound. Once you've trained the instrument to do what you want, you're in control and you're free.''         Despite her successful Hollywood career, Miss Page remained a strong supporter of repertory theater throughout her life, often acting in them at a low salary and in supporting roles. Recently, as a member of the Mirror Repertory Company, she appeared in ''The Madwoman of Chaillot.''         Miss Page won two Emmy awards for her television performances, both in the late 1960's for roles in adaptations of Truman Capote stories, ''A Christmas Memory'' and ''The Thanksgiving Visitor.''         Miss Page is survived by her third husband, the actor Rip Torn; their three children, Jonathan, Anthony and Angelica Torn-Burkhardt; a grandchild, Elija Burkhardt, and a brother, Donald.         A memorial service will be held at the Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52d Street, at 11 A.M. on Wednesday.

She was 90 years old and lived in Scullville, N.J.         She was one of a group of women who enlisted in the Marines in 1918 to free men for combat duty. The ''marinettes,'' as they were referred to unofficially, were assigned to clerical duties. She was assigned as a secretary to a Philadelphia recruiting officer.         A similar group of women who served in the Navy in World War I were referred to as ''yeomanettes,'' and Mrs. Watson's oldest sister was serving at the time with that group.

        Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Mary Astor, who had a delicate beauty, extraordinary grace and a compelling acting style in more than 100 movies over 45 years, died early yesterday of complications from emphysema at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Astor entered silent films in 1920 as a willowy 14-year-old and portrayed scores of vulnerable ingenues. Two decades later she gave her most indelible performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon,'' John Huston's crime classic. Her subtle, mature portrayal of a seemingly sympathetic woman who was, in fact, evilly duplicitous, took audiences by surprise. Such women were rarely the heroines of movies then, nor had they been portrayed as deceptively as Miss Astor portrayed the homicidal Brigid O'Shaughnessy.         In the same year, 1941, she was a ruthless, egocentric concert pianist battling Bette Davis in ''The Great Lie,'' for which Miss Astor won an Oscar as the best actress in a supporting role. ''If I'd had my druthers,'' she later wrote, ''I would have preferred getting my Oscar for 'The Maltese Falcon.' '' Sophisticates and Villains         Other skillful characterizations included a warmly urbane widow in ''Dodsworth'' (1936), a spurned mistress in the 1937 version of the swashbuckling ''Prizoner of Zenda,'' a disillusioned wife in ''The Hurricane'' (1937) and a sympathetic prostitute in ''Act of Violence'' (1949).         But few of her films matched the turmoil of her private life. In 1936, she was the center of one of Hollywood's most spectacular scandals when she sued Dr. Franklyn Thorpe for legal custody of their 4-year-old daughter, Marylyn. Dr. Thorpe had divorced Miss Astor a year earlier.         The suit led to disclosure of her diary, which allegedly contained accounts of liaisons with many celebrities. Dr. Thorpe sought to use the diary to prove she was an unfit mother, and purported excerpts were published in newspapers under suggestive headlines.         Miss Astor repeatedly maintained that the excerpts were lurid forgeries. She later acknowledged that an authentic portion published by one newspaper included ''a rather overemotional account of a romantic interlude with George S. Kaufman,'' the playwright.         The trial judge ordered the diary sealed and impounded. It was inadmissible as evidence, she wrote later, because her former husband had removed pages involving himself. Miss Astor was granted custody of her daughter for nine months a year, with Dr. Thorpe allowed custody the three other months. The diary was never made public, and a judge witnessed its burning in 1952. Won Beauty Contest at 11         During the 30-day trial, Hollywood producers, fearing the scandal would damage the film industry, pressed Miss Astor to drop the suit, but she refused, risking her reputation and career to keep her daughter. Soon after the trial, throngs of people hailed her courage when she toured with screenings of ''Dodsworth.''         Mary Astor was born Lucile Langhanke on May 3, 1906, in Quincy, Ill., the only child of the former Helen Vasconcells, an American, and Otto Ludwig Wilhelm Langhanke, a German immigrant who made an uncertain income from such diverse activities as teaching German and poultry farming until he began to cash in on his daughter's film success.         The girl won her first movie contract with Famous Players-Lasky and, with it, the name Mary Astor. Within two years she was making features and her salary started soaring. In 1923, the family went to Hollywood and she became John Barrymore's leading lady in ''Beau Brummel.''         She was teamed with Barrymore again in ''Don Juan'' (1926), which introduced a Vitaphone background-music soundtrack, the harbinger of talkies. Her early sound films included ''Holiday'' (1930), playing the materialistic sister of Ann Harding, and ''Red Dust'' (1932), in which she portrayed a frustrated wife attracted to Clark Gable. Sued for Nonsupport by Parents         Later movies included ''Midnight'' (1939), ''Brigham Young - Frontiersman'' (1940), ''Across the Pacific'' (1942), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942), ''Claudia and David'' (1946) and ''Return to Peyton Place'' (1961).         Miss Astor's professional successes were punctuated by personal tragedies. In 1930, her first husband, Kenneth Hawks, was killed in a plane crash while directing a movie.         Her parents lived lavishly, taking nearly all her salary, but in 1934 she put them on an allowance. Unable to continue embellishing the mansion and estate she had given them, they sued her for nonsupport. She said that ''from 1920 to 1930, I gave my father $461,000'' while she kept only $24,000. She agreed to pay them $100 a month, and the suit was dismissed.         After the diary scandal, Miss Astor was married to Manuel del Campo, a Mexican sportsman, by whom she had a son, Anthony, and later to Thomas G. Wheelock, a businessman. Both marriages ended in divorce. A Drinking Problem         Her tangled personal life and the financial pressures to keep working worsened a longtime drinking problem. She sought help from a priest-psychologist, the Rev. Peter Ciklic, and to further her therapy, he had her write notes about her life. At his urging, she revised the notes into a 1959 autobiography, ''My Story.'' It was praised by reviewers for its style and uncompromising insights.         Personally regenerated, she began writing novels and completed a successful memoir on movie making, ''A Life on Film,'' in 1971. Her first novel, ''The Incredible Charlie Carewe,'' about a charming rotter, was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as ''lively entertainment.''         In ''A Life on Film,'' Miss Astor deplored a ''poverty of spirit'' in many contemporary movies, writing that ''whatever we did - we old moviemakers - we gave people a lot of fun. Through depressions and wars and calamities, we gave them the sense of glory, of a future that would be braver than today.''         Miss Astor retired to the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills in 1974 and contributed to it from her writing income.         Besides her daughter and son, the actress is survived by an undisclosed number of grandchildren. A funeral service will be private.
