         Helen Haje, a Washington public relations woman who championed Arab-American interests with such good-natured fervor that she became gadfly and godmother to the Arab-American movement in the United States, died on Monday at a hospital near her home in Washington. She was 74.         Her family said the cause was congestive heart failure.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Mrs. Haje, who grew up in Altoona, Pa., and married a local Lebanese-American businessman, seemed content with her role as an  American housewife and mother.         But when her husband, Albert, died at the age of 33 in the early 1940's, leaving her with three young children, she pulled up stakes, moved to Washington and went to work, first as a secretary for Catholic Charities and later as an independent public relations woman.         Had it not been for the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and a resulting wave of  Arab stereotypes that swept the United States, Mrs. Haje might have remained a conventional public relations woman, representing commercial and other clients.         In a land of immigrants where ethnic and national societies abound, there had been virtually no Arab-American organizations in the United States, but in the wake of the 1967 war, many prominent Arab-Americans saw the need for a concerted effort both to counter the demonizing stereotypes and to lobby for policies favorable to their often-embattled homelands.         Through her long work with the Saints Peter and Paul Antiochian Orthodox Church in Bethesda, Md., Mrs. Haje had gotten to know and impress many of Washington's leading Arab-American figures, and in 1972 when a group of them formed the National Association of Arab-Americans as the first political Arab-American organization, Mrs. Haje suddenly found herself in the forefront of a movement.         Volunteering to become the group's first executive secretary, she operated the organization for its first few years, first from her home and later at a small office.         Although it was her typing skills that most benefited the organization in its formative stages, the association's founders, many of them unfamiliar with the ways of Washington, soon found her public relations expertise even more valuable.         Over the next years, Mrs. Hafe, a gregarious woman with a wide circle of friends and a bulging file of telephone numbers, continually amazed Arab-American leaders and visiting Arab diplomats with the ease with which she could put them in touch with journalists and newscasters, many of whom were, in turn, equally amazed with the ease with which she could ferret out and secure them interviews with obscure Arab officials or Arab-American scholars, lawyers and business leaders.         Mrs. Haje did not know every one of the estimated three million Arab-Americans in the United States. It just sometimes seemed she did. Although Lebanese-Americans, who account for a third of the total, are the most populous Arab group in the United States, Mrs. Haje recognized and celebrated the common bond among Americans from Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and other Arab counties.         Mrs. Haje, who also served as a bridge between Arab-American organizations, eventually worked so closely with so many of them, including the Arab-American Discrimination Committee and the Arab-American University Graduates Association, that Dr. Clovis Maksud, the Lebanese-born former head of the Arab League, called her the ''mother'' of most of the Arab-American organizations in the United States.         ''At a moment of great despair among Arab-Americans,'' Dr. Maksud said yesterday, ''she helped mobilize and organize the community.''         For all her devotion to her ancestral home in Lebanon and to other Arab countries, Mrs. Haje was a thoroughgoing American who emphasized the need for Arab-American leaders to criticize their homelands' governments when their actions warranted it.         Her survivors include two sons, Charles, of Destin, Fla., and Albert Jr., of Washington; a daughter, Sharyn Corry of Middleburg, Va.; two sisters, four brothers and two grandchildren.       
         Harriet Van Horne, a pioneer radio and television critic whose tough-minded crusades for educational programming and against ''women's chatter programs, the vulgar outpourings of the soap opera and the bad taste of commercials'' attracted a wide following in The New York World-Telegram and other Scripps-Howard newspapers for a quarter of a century, died on Thursday at New York Hospital.         She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Van Horne, who later wrote a syndicated column for The New York Post, died of breast cancer, said a friend, Leslie Rubinstein.         Ms. Van Horne liked to say she got into television criticism ''the day they invented it.'' Jack Gould of The New York Times; John Crosby, the syndicated columnist of The New York Herald Tribune, and Ms. Van Horne were the early critics most admired and feared in the late 1940's and early 50's.         In those days many programs originated in New York and were broadcast live. It came to be known as television's golden age, but she remembered it as a less precious metal.         In 1976 she was interviewed by Nora Ephron for Esquire. Ms. Ephron asked her to think about all the years she had spent listening to the radio and watching television.         She liked radio well enough, she said, until it occurred to her that by thinking and writing about it, she had become ''as dull and as intellectually sterile as everybody else in the radio business.''         But when she considered her work in television, it made radio programming look positively metaphysical.         ''It destroyed me,'' Ms. Van Horne said. ''I did a television column for 20 years, five columns a week, and I was always in a little screening room in the afternoon and at the television set at night. My reading program went to hell. Had I stayed in television, it would have killed me. Imagine reviewing 'I Love Lucy' 20 times. Imagine reviewing 'Gunsmoke' 20 times. It would rot anybody's brain.''         In later years she had fond memories of shows like ''Playhouse 90'' especially when she compared it with ''all the canned shows from Universal and all the crime and cowboys and so on.''         Later in her career, Ms. Van Horne became a syndicated columnist for The New York Post, writing about almost anything three times a week. The column contained the old wit and graceful prose that her readers had prized, but it was not picked up by many papers in syndication because it could not be categorized.         ''It's really not totally suitable for the editorial page because it's often frivolous and womanish,'' she told Ms. Ephron. ''On the other hand, it is often serious in a political sense and therefore, not entirely right for the women's page.''         Harriet Van Horne was born in Syracuse on May 17, 1920, and graduated from the College for Women of the University of Rochester in 1940.         She got her first full-time newspaper job at The Greenwich Time in Connecticut, by running an ad in Editor and Publisher that began, ''Blue-eyed blonde with a nose for news and a way with words, fresh out of college.''         Scoops were important in those days, and one of hers was a story and pictures of one of the playboy Tommy Manville's many brief marriages. It helped her get a job at The World-Telegram.         In her long career, she also wrote for The World Journal Tribune, Newsday, The New York Times Syndicate and The Los Angeles Times Entertainment Syndicate and was a frequent guest on television programs.         Ms. Van Horne was married to David Lowe, a documentary producer who died several years ago. She is survived by her sisters, Helen Van Graffeiland of Rochester and Ida Schatzle of Floral City, Fla.         In 1972, she published ''Never Go Anywhere Without a Pencil,'' a collection of her published essays. In it, she summed up in a few words her view of the newspaper business: ''We love newspapers the way a plain woman loves a charming, no-good husband.''       
         Ellen Scripps Davis, a horse breeder and granddaughter of the newspaper publisher Edward Wyllis Scripps, died on Feb. 8 in a fire at her home in San Diego. She was 84.         Her husband, Everett Conley Davis, 83, was also killed in the fire.         Though less involved in the newspaper business than her grandfather, who founded the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain and United Press International, Ms. Scripps Davis maintained links to the publishing industry. She and her brother James helped administer the Scripps League Newspapers, which at one time included dozens of local newspapers across the country. The company was sold to the Pulitzer Publishing Company in 1996.         Ms. Scripps Davis and her daughter Michelle Macfarlane were among the top-ranked mother-daughter teams nationally in horse breeding and training. Ms. Scripps Davis was president of the California Saddle Horse Breeders Association.         Her husband was retired from his law practice.         Ms. Scripps Davis is survived by her daughters, Ms. Macfarlane, of San Diego, and Victoria Greene of Los Angeles.       
         Barbara Benson Crowther, a business manager of a law firm and a volunteer in mental health, died yesterday at her home in Palmyra, Va. She was 60 years old. She died of a heart attack, her husband, F. Bosley Crowther 3d, said.         Ms. Crowther was born in New York City and managed Mr. Crowther's law firm in Palmyra. She was a former chairwoman of a community board in Fluvanna County, Va., that provided services for mental health, mental retardation and drug addiction.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Barbara C. Marziali of Charlottesville, Va.; a son, F. Bosley Crowther 4th of Los Angeles; a brother, Edward George Benson Jr. of Storrs, Conn. and a sister, M. Ophelia Benson of Seattle.       
         Chessy Rayner, a decorator, fashion icon, editor and author of ''New York: Trends and Traditions,'' a recently published book about significant Manhattan interiors, died on Thursday night at Sloan-Kettering Medical Center in New York. She was 66.         Mica Ertegun, her partner in the design company MAC II, said that Mrs. Rayner died of lung cancer.         Rail-thin, exotically featured and crowned with a lion's mane of hair that gave her the look of a space-age Nefertiti, Chesbrough (Chessy) Lewis Hall was born in 1931 in Perrysburg, Ohio, into a privileged world where little was expected of a young woman except a fairy tale debut, a comfortable marriage and an entry in the Social Register.         The only child of Richard Hall and Chesbrough Lewis, a cafe society beauty famously photographed by Horst and Avedon, she dutifully followed her social destiny: finishing school, Briarcliff Junior College and candle-lighted wedding at St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal Church in Manhattan, in 1952, to William P. Rayner, a stockbroker who later became an executive at Conde Nast Publications.         The Rayners were celebrated in Vogue as ''a fast-paced, superattractive couple,'' and rare was the week when her haunting face and couture-clad frame did not appear in Women's Wear Daily.         Her star quotient increased exponentially in 1963, after her mother remarried, becoming the wife of Iva S. V. Patcevitch, the chairman of Conde Nast. For the rest of her life, she was one of the best-dressed and most-photographed fixtures of the Manhattan social scene.         But rather than idling indefinitely in the social spotlight, Mrs. Rayner  went to work for Ladies Home Journal, moved to Glamour, and then became a fashion editor at Vogue from 1956 to 1964.         By the mid-1960's, William Rayner said, ''The bubble was off the champagne.'' Bored with the business of fashion and chafing under her dictatorial boss, Diana Vreeland, Mrs. Rayner left Vogue and went in search of what William Rayner  called ''less ephemeral, more creative'' work. The couple were divorced in 1989.         She is survived by her mother, Chesbrough Patcevitch; a half-brother, Charles Minot Amory 3d, and a nephew, Charles Minot Amory 4th, all of Palm Beach, Fla.         She and Mica Ertegun, the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, the president of Atlantic Records, toyed with opening a restaurant. Though accomplished cooks -- Mrs. Rayner wrote three cookbooks -- friends decided that their individual talents, Mrs. Rayner's sense of color and Mrs. Ertegun's architectural eye, would offer more long-term opportunities.  MAC II -- the initials stood for Mica and Chessy -- was founded in 1967. For several years, its office was a large closet in the Erteguns' house on the Upper East Side.         Though House and Garden hailed the company for its ''consistently clean and crisp adaptations of shifting modes,'' initially, fellow designers looked upon the two young stylish women with disdain. Sister Parish, the white-gloved martinet of American decorating, dismissed them with chilling politesse: ''Chessy is a nice girl. And Mica does not have to work.'' Everybody else called them ''the girls.'' As Mrs. Rayner wryly told Vogue soon after MAC II opened, ''You can see how much dignity we command.''         Their first published project was a bedroom for the 9-year-old daughter of a friend, with tall bookcases made of bamboo poles and topped with burnt-orange felt valances. Soon, however, they became a force to be reckoned with, and by the early 1980's had amassed a portfolio of residential and commercial projects for boldface celebrities like the artist Kenneth Noland, the television producer Douglas Cramer and the fashion designer Bill Blass. Marian McEvoy, the editor of Elle Decor magazine, said that what distinguished their projects was ''pragmatic glamour.''         ''Chessy was a decorator, not a re-decorator,'' said Arnold Scaasi, the fashion designer. ''One of the reasons that I chose her was because she told me I could keep all of my old furniture.''         MAC II's spare, uncluttered rooms are known for luxurious but simple finishes, comfortable seating and art that is part of the space, not a dominant element. In one New York living room, moody paintings by Manet and Van Dongen seemed to be emerging from the surface of the gold lacquered walls as from the bottom of a pond.         But despite her professional eminence, Mrs. Rayner, who enjoyed discovering beauty in unlikely places and at underwhelming prices, did not shy from projects that her equally celebrated competition might consider beneath their dignity.         To furnish a landmark house designed by the architect Stanford White, she and Mrs. Ertegun cheerfully bought everything at Sears. For another project, it was all department-store furniture and Herculon fabrics.         In the pages of Elle Decor, where she was the special projects editor from 1992 until her death, Mrs. Rayner was forever exhorting readers to delight more in $2 water glasses than in $2 million chandeliers. Her home on St. Martin, the Caribbean island, will be featured in the May issue of Elle Decor.         ''Not everything has to be refined,'' she once said to a reporter who visited her country house in Southampton. ''That's too easy and too boring. I like amusing things, funny things, offbeat things. In fact, if anything, I wish my taste were even more offbeat.''       
         Jean Blackwell Hutson, who as curator and then chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture helped make it the world's main public repository of materials on people of African descent, died on  Wednesday at Harlem Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Harlem.         From 1948, when the Schomburg Center was known as the Schomburg Collection, until 1980, when she retired as its chief, Mrs. Hutson harnessed her powerful will to assemble an archive of documents, books and works of art that reflected the experience not just of African-Americans, but of peoples throughout the African diaspora.         Under her supervision, the library grew to 75,000 volumes from 15,000 volumes. She assembled an important collection of historical material from Haiti, as well as of African art, and persuaded her childhood friend, Langston Hughes, to donate a portion of his papers to the center. A friend of Romare Bearden, Dorothy West, Richard Wright, W. E. B. DuBois and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance, Mrs. Hutson helped make the Schomburg the cultural center of Harlem.         Even when people, both black and white, during the integrationist movement of the 1940's and early 50's, questioned the need for a separate archive devoted entirely to black experience, Mrs. Hutson championed it. And in the years when the Schomburg's budget was faltering, she fought for financing, and lobbied the State Legislature for money.         ''She had an exacting personality,'' said Howard Dodson, the present chief of the Schomburg. ''She ran a tight ship and had an astute way of getting what she wanted done.  Once her mind was set on doing something, there was no stopping her.''         She was born in 1914 in Sommerfield, Fla., where her father, Paul O. Blackwell, was in business as a  farmer. Her mother, Sarah Myers  Blackwell, was an elementary school teacher. When she was 4, she and her mother moved to Baltimore while her father remained in Florida to run his business, commuting back and forth to Baltimore to visit his family.         Through her baby sitter, who ran a boarding house, she met the poet Langston Hughes. Hughes was then a student at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa., and went to Baltimore on weekends. Their friendship endured. Throughout his life he referred to her as his ''baby sister,'' and when Mrs. Hutson came to Harlem as a young woman, Hughes made sure she met the leading writers and artists.         At 15, Mrs. Hutson was class valedictorian at her graduation from Douglass High School in Baltimore, then an all-black high school in a segregated system. The school had exacting standards and emphasized the study of black history and literature. One of her teachers was Yolande Du Bois, the daughter of W. E. B. DuBois.         She attended the University of Michigan, then switched to Barnard College. In 1935, she became the second black woman to graduate from Barnard; the first was Zora Neale Hurston.         Mrs. Hutson wanted to be a psychiatrist but took up library science with the goal of financing medical studies. In 1936 she received a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Her first job was in the New York City Public Branch Library system. As a librarian in the Bronx, Mrs. Hutson noticed that there were few Spanish-language books that would appeal to the borough's Spanish population, and she arranged to buy some. In 1939, she married Andy Razaf, a lyricist who wrote songs for Fats Waller. The marriage ended in divorce eight years later.         In 1950 she married John Hutson, a fellow employee at the Countee Cullen branch library. Mr. Hutson died in 1957. They had one daughter, Jean Frances, who died in 1992. Mrs. Hutson left no survivors.         In 1948, Mrs. Hutson was asked to take over the Schomburg, which was based on the private library of Arthur Alphonzo Schomburg, a Puerto Rican of African descent. ''I was drafted for six months to keep the Negroes quiet,'' Mrs. Hutson once said. ''People who grew up in the Depression didn't throw away jobs, so I came.''         With the rise of the black power movement and the success of independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, interest in the Schomburg grew. In 1962, under her supervision, the library published the Dictionary Catalogue of the Schomburg Collection, which was put on microfilm and made its holdings known to libraries in Europe, Africa and the Americas.         Mrs. Hutson's work in developing the Schomburg caught the attention of President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, who asked her help in building an Africana collection at the University of Ghana. She lived in Ghana in 1964.         During the 1960's and 70's, the situation at the Schomburg grew perilous, with its collections deteriorating in the Countee Cullen branch library, a sparsely furnished, poorly lighted  space without air-conditioning at 103 West 135th Street. In 1971, Mrs. Hutson helped establish the Schomburg Corporation to raise money for a new building.         She ''learned to go to Albany,'' as she said once in an interview. There were many politicians, Mrs. Hutson said, ''who had never seen a black woman up in front of them at the legislature.'' Eventually she helped obtain a Federal grant for the construction of a new building.         In 1981, the new $3.7 million center finally opened, five stories tall, built of red brick and glass, climate-controlled, with an art gallery. By then, Mrs. Hutson had retired as the Schomburg's chief, and had taken a job in the office of library administration at the Public Library's headquarters on 42d Street.         Today, the Schomburg Collection holds some 150,000 volumes, 3.5 million manuscripts, the largest assemblage of photographs in the world documenting black life, and precious artifacts including a 16th-century manuscript, ''Ad Catholicum,'' by Juan Latino, believed to be the first book written by a black man.       
         Marje Fields, a longtime talent agent who was a pioneer in placing well-known actors in television commercials, died on Jan. 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.         Among the clients represented at one time by her agency, Marje Fields Inc., were John Travolta, Ted Danson, Nancy Walker, Edward Hermann, Barry Bostwick and Hal Linden. While Ms. Fields, whose married name was Karp, concentrated on the television advertising, side of the business, others in her office also represented some of their clients for theatrical productions.         While president of the National Association of Talent Representatives, Ms. Fields led a three-year legal battle to end the licensing of talent agents by actors' unions and the payment of franchise fees by agents to the unions.         That effort eventually led to a 1981 ruling by the United States Supreme Court. The union practice of requiring members to work only for talent agents the union had licensed was deemed to be constitutional, and not a violation of anti-trust laws, as Ms. Fields's group had argued.         But the justices were split on the legality of the franchise fees, which unions -- Actors' Equity, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio artists -- had required licensed agents to pay to them. The fees were eventually discontinued by the unions.         Ms. Fields began her career at the Air Features agency, later moving to the Charles B. Tranum Agency, where she became a leader in the then-new concept of placing famous actors in television commercials.         In 1971, she formed her own agency, which closed in 1994 when she retired. She married Oscar Karp, owner of Oscar's Salt of the Sea restaurant in Manhattan, in 1983. Mr. Karp died in 1986.       
         Helen Billings Burnham, a one-time real estate woman with no legal training who spent 22 years dispensing justice, sometimes from her family room, as a part-time, round-the-clock town justice in Salina, N.Y., died on Thursday at her home in Mattydale, a suburb of Syracuse. She was 81 and had retired in 1993.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         As a judge who never went to law school, Mrs. Burnham was hardly an anomaly. Only about a quarter of New York's 2,000 or so local court judges have law degrees.         Even so, when the Salina town board named her to succeed her husband, Richard, as town justice after he was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971, there were those who thought she did not belong on the bench. Her husband's friends, she recalled, told her it was not a job for a lady. After all, although town justices mainly handle traffic offenses and small claims disputes, perform wedding ceremonies and preside over misdemeanor cases involving penalties of no more than a year in jail, those who are hauled into court are rarely the most reputable of citizens. And the duties of a town justice also include arraigning accused murderers and other desperate felony suspects, sometimes in the middle of the night.         Mrs. Burnham, a large, imposing woman who had run her own real estate business and served as her husband's clerk during his nine years as town justice, was not intimidated.         ''I became a judge and stopped being a lady,'' she said.         The appointment, which made her the 16th woman to serve as judge in New York and the first in Onondaga County, was not popular with her husband's Republican allies.         At the end of the year, when the Republicans named a man to run in a special election to fill out her husband's term, Mrs. Burnham felt miffed enough to leave the Republican Party but not enough to become an actual Democrat. So she blithely switched her enrollment to the Conservative Party, picked up the gleeful endorsement of local Democrats and won the election.         After that, neither the Republicans nor anybody else bothered to put up a candidate against her. Running unopposed, she won five more four-year terms.         A native of Earlville, N.Y., Mrs. Burnham attended the Utica School of Commerce and moved to Mattydale, a Salina hamlet, in 1952 when her husband, who was a lawyer, took a job with an insurance company in Syracuse before starting a private practice there.         By the time of her husband's death, Mrs. Burnham had spent enough time in his courtroom, an attached garage that had been converted to a family room, to know pretty much what to expect.         Over the next two decades she dispensed justice with such consistent compassion, good humor and common sense that in 1989 the National Judges Association named her the outstanding non-attorney judge in the United States.         Shortly before she became town justice, Salina had provided a courtroom in the municipal office building, but except for scheduled traffic court evenings and the like, until she closed it in 1980, Mrs. Burnham performed most of her part-time judicial duties at her real estate office.         But as a town justice on call 24 hours a day, she did not bother to redecorate the old family room.         In a sequence that became a familiar drill, Mrs. Burnham would be awakened by a midnight call from the sheriff's office, get out of bed, slip her black judicial robe over her nightgown and be ready, gavel in hand, when the latest felony suspect was brought in for arraignment.         For all her work on criminal cases, Mrs. Burnham was best known for her weddings.         She performed more than 3,000 marriage ceremonies, earning the nickname ''the marrying judge,'' in part because when it came to marriage, Mrs. Burnham was a judicial romantic who would go just about anywhere anytime in the cause of Cupid.         Over the years, she presided at poolside weddings, one in an airplane, another on horseback and on more than a few occasions at hospital maternity wards a few contractions ahead of the bride's baby.         After she stepped down as town justice, Mrs. Burnham was named Salina's town historian and produced two books, one a history of Mattydale, and the other, ''The Room on the Side of the House,'' an account of her judicial experiences.         A fun-loving, outspoken woman who learned to curb her tongue during her years on the bench, Mrs. Burnham relished her retirement.         ''Now I'm not a judge or a lady,'' she said. ''I can say and do whatever I want to.''         She is survived by two sons, Richard of Virginia Beach, Va., and William of Cicero, N.Y.; four daughters, Jeanne Steffanelli of Portsmouth, Va., Linda Bamberger of Mattydale and Candice Jost and Cynthia Morris of Syracuse; 15 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.       
         Marianne Burge, the first woman to become a partner in the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, died Feb. 25 at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 64.         The cause of death was cancer, Price Waterhouse said.         Mrs. Burge joined the firm as a tax consultant in 1966 and became a partner in 1973.         An international tax specialist, she served for 13 years as the managing partner of the firm's international tax services practice in New York before her retirement in 1993. She was also a member of Price Waterhouse's worldwide tax services panel and was the first woman to lead a national practice area for the firm.         An authority on income tax treaties, Mrs. Burge advised Price Waterhouse clients on all aspects of multinational taxation, including joint ventures and acquisitions. She was also a specialist in international tax issues for the insurance industry, and worked extensively with insurance companies for the firm.         She lived in Manhattan and was a member of numerous professional organizations. They included the United States Council of International Business, the Financial Women's Association of New York and the International Fiscal Association. She was a former president of the International Tax Association.         Mrs. Burge was born on June 18, 1933 in Vienna. She received a bachelor's degree and master's degree, both in modern languages, from Cambridge University in England.         She is survived by her husband, William Burge of New York, to whom she had been married for 40 years.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Celestine Tate Harrington, a quadriplegic street musician whose buoyant personality and unremitting chutzpah brought astounded smiles to everyone who watched her play the keyboard with her lips and tongue on Atlantic City's Boardwalk, died on Feb. 25 at the Atlantic City Medical Center. She was 42.         She died of complications resulting from critical injuries she suffered in a traffic accident on Feb. 19.         Mrs. Harrington was born with a congenital joint condition that eroded the connective tissue in her arms and legs, leaving them immobile stubs, but she never seemed to consider herself disabled. Her daily street performances in front of Bally's Park Place Casino and Caesar's Palace, where she performed ''Amazing Grace'' and ''Stormy Weather'' on an electric synthesizer, were studies not only in the art of music, but also in the art human self-salvation.         Mrs. Harrington was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and her father abandoned her when she was 6 years old, family members and a friend said.         Raised by her maternal grandparents, a construction worker and a registered nurse, she eventually became a parent herself. In 1974, in downtown Philadelphia, she met John Smith, a nursing home aide who courted her while she lived at the Moss Rehabilitation Clinic in Philadelphia. She bore him a daughter, Nia, in 1975, but before the couple could marry, Mr. Smith died.         The death led the courts to seek custody of Nia. Mrs. Harrington won the right to raise her child in 1976 by demonstrating to a dumbstruck judge what she could manage: she changed the baby's diaper with her teeth.         Three years later, she met a construction worker, Stanford Williams. In 1979, they, too, had a daughter, Coronda, but never married.         Mrs. Harrington learned to play the keyboard at Philadelphia's Settlement Music School. Soon afterward, she decided to take her newfound skill downtown, where she played for change on the sidewalk in front of Wanamaker's department store. But Atlantic City -- bustling with tourists and extra change -- beckoned. She arrived on the Boardwalk in 1984, and she eventually moved into a condominium in Atlantic City purchased with the proceeds from her busking.         She often boasted that as much as $100,000 a year was dropped into her plastic bucket, though friends and relatives gently dispute that claim.         Though Mrs. Harrington eventually started a tiny enterprise designing business cards, her main interest was her music, and her repertoire of solemn ballads like ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' and patriotic hymns like ''America the Beautiful,'' quickly made her a redemptive presence in a gambling town. They also won her a following among the Boardwalk's casual strollers.         By 1989, Mrs. Harrington was a beloved presence, partly because of the remarkable figure she cut: a 4-foot, 10-inch tall, 190-pound woman moving swiftly, lying on her stomach, head up, , through the city streets on a motorized gurney that she guided with a steering device worked by her chin. But she was also known for the inspirational message she spread as a guest on national talk shows or to people she met on the Boardwalk with whom she formed close relationships.         Among them was her husband, Roy Harrington, a casino maintenance man who came along in 1990. In the next year, the couple married and adopted Charles Graves, the son of a former boyfriend.         In addition to her husband and three children, Mrs. Harrington is survived by two sisters, Agnes Tate-Sanders and Tamogene Tate, both of Philadelphia, and a brother, Jay-Cee Tate of North Carolina.         Another person that Mrs. Harrington befriended was Camille LeClair, co-owner of a McDonald's restaurant in Atlantic City who hired her last year to take phone deliveries.         A poignant memory of Mrs. Harrington was on her mind last week when word came that she had died. On one occasion when Mrs. Harrington was in her house, Mrs. LeClair said: ''I hopped in the shower and when I came back I said to Celestine, 'Why does God allow me to jump in and out of the shower in 10 minutes, but you have to struggle so much?'  Well, Celestine just looked at me and said, 'That's why I'm here. To keep reminding you to count your blessings every day.' ''       
         Kasey Cisyk, an opera-trained singer who never made it to the Met but whose haunting coloratura soprano became one of the world's most listened-to voices, died on March 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 44 and had been the singing voice of the long-running ''Have You Driven a Ford Lately?'' advertising campaign.         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         In the capricious world of show business, she never enjoyed splashy success, but in the backwaters of her profession, where most singers, after all, spend their entire careers, Miss Cisyk, a tiny, slender woman with a smile as big as her heart, made her share of waves.         She worked as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Quincy Jones; she dubbed the Oscar-winning title song for the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life,'' and in the demanding world of commercial jingles, she was a star, one whose very anonymity was a critical asset.         It allowed her, for example, to amass a list of credits that included such archrivals as ABC, NBC and CBS; McDonald's and Burger King, American and Delta airlines and even Coke and Pepsi.         And for all her long run with Ford, Miss Cisyk also sang in the service of Chevrolet, Cadillac and Toyota.         It was her work for Ford that made her the envy of her colleagues. From the time she became the voice of Ford in 1981 until the campaign was finally retired two months ago, hers was the most ubiquitous voice in the land. In 1989, when the campaign was nearing the midpoint of its 17-year run, an industry record for a corporate soloist, Ford executives estimated that Miss Cisyk had been heard by a cumulative audience of 20 billion.         Maybe not what she had in mind when she was studying opera at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, but not at all bad for a Queens-born daughter of a Ukrainian virtuoso who wanted her to play the violin.         Miss Cisyk, whose father maintained a studio on the Lower East Side, learned the instrument when she was 5 (she also studied ballet), and after graduating from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, she dutifully accepted a violin scholarship to Mannes.         By the time she graduated she had switched to classical voice training, won encouraging praise for roles in student opera productions, and sung  ''Rigoletto'' in Ghent on a New York State scholarship in Belgium.         For all her promise, Miss Cisyk, whose father died when she was 17, was drawn away from opera and into the world of jingles by the pressing need to make a living.         She found work singing in clubs in New York, but for a while in the mid-70's she despaired of breaking into the tight-knit world of commercials. For months after she had circulated tapes to advertising agencies she heard nothing.         Then the executives got around to listening to the tapes, and the calls started coming in, slowly at first, but after six months of sporadic work, an entire industry seemed to make the simultaneous discovery that her voice was money in the bank.         Suddenly she was in such demand that a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 A.M. session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at 11, Hartz Mountain at 1 P.M., Eastern Airlines at 2, Datsun at 3, L'Eggs at 5, McDonald's at 6, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 P.M. to 3 A.M.         By the time Ford came calling in 1981, she had learned to pace herself.         After an early marriage and divorce, she married Edward J. Rakowicz, a recording engineer, had a son, Edward W., now 7, and became as devoted a mother as she had been a dedicated singer.         But even after her cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and she began the long, painful ordeal of therapy, Miss Cisyk, who is also survived by her older sister, Maria, a concert pianist and teacher who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., continued to work, singing her last professional jingle just a few months ago.         She may never have made it to the Met or even had a popular hit record in the United States, but she was not a complete unknown in the world of music.         Miss Cisyk, whose given name was Kvita (Ukrainian for flower), adopted the professional name Kasey from her initials, intending to reserve Kvita for an opera career that never happened. She eventually found a use for it after all.         A woman who cherished her Ukrainian heritage, Miss Cisyk formed her own production company in 1988 and recorded two C.D.'s, one  (''Kvita'') of Ukrainian folk songs, the other (''Kvita Two Colors'') of Ukrainian love songs.         Both have been wildly popular among the 100 million far-flung Ukrainian expatriates and in Ukraine, where the woman who worked in the backwaters of American show business was regarded as a leading performer and is very much a household name.       
         Linda Eastman McCartney, the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney and a photographer whose portraits of 1960's rock stars have become classics, died on Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the McCartneys were vacationing. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer that spread to her liver, said Geoff Baker, a family spokesman.         Besides her work as a photographer, Ms. McCartney performed as a keyboardist and backup singer in two of her husband's post-Beatles bands, Wings and the unnamed ensemble that toured in 1989 and 1993. She was a staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism and, starting in the late 1980's, she turned her passion for vegetarian cooking into an industry. She published two cookbooks, ''Linda McCartney's Home Cooking'' in 1989 and ''Linda's Kitchen'' in 1996, and in 1991 started a line of frozen vegetarian dinners.         As the wife of a musician who had long been a teen-age heartthrob and was the last Beatle to be married,  Ms. McCartney first attracted the ire of her husband's fans, and eventually the respect of many of them. When the McCartneys were married in London on March 12, 1969, hundreds of crying girls packed the sidewalk outside the Marylebone Register Office. Later, when she toured with Mr. McCartney, she took considerable criticism for her modest keyboard and vocal technique.         But the McCartneys' 29-year marriage was uncommonly steady by the standards of the celebrity world of which they were a part but from which they generally remained aloof, spending most of their time on a farm in West Sussex, England. They  never spent a night apart, except for the 10 days Mr. McCartney spent in a Tokyo jail after he was arrested for marijuana possession; indeed, their disinclination to be separated was part of Mr. McCartney's reason for having his wife in his touring band.         And Mr. McCartney, the composer of some of the rock era's most beautiful love songs, has consistently told interviewers that all his romantic  ballads written after 1968 were about Linda. Those songs include everything from ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' and ''The Lovely Linda'' on his first post-Beatles album, ''McCartney'' (1970), ''Long-Haired Lady'' on ''Ram'' (1971) and ''My Love'' on ''Red Rose Speedway'' (1973) to more recent songs like ''We Got Married'' and ''Figure of Eight'' on ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989) and ''Somedays'' on ''Flaming Pie'' (1997), his most recent studio album.         Mr. McCartney was not the first to compose a song about Ms. McCartney. Her father, Lee Eastman, was a prominent show business lawyer in New York and one of his clients, Jack Lawrence, wrote ''Linda'' for her in 1947 when she was 6. Buddy Clark had a hit with the song that year, and it was later recorded by Perry Como and Jan and Dean.         Ms. McCartney also wrote a few songs, including the reggae-style ''Seaside Woman,'' which she and Mr. McCartney released as a single in 1977 under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes, and ''The White-Coated Man,'' which she wrote with Carla Lane and released (also as Suzy and the Red Stripes) on an animal-rights charity disk, ''Animal Magnetism,'' in 1994.         She was born Linda Louise Eastman on September 24, 1941, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. As she often pointed out, without ever dispelling the assertion entirely, she was not related to the Eastmans of the Eastman-Kodak photography empire. In fact, her father had changed his name from Epstein.         She described growing up in artistic and materialistic surroundings, with a status-conscious mother and a father whose friends and clients included the artist Willem de Kooning and the songwriters Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Arlen.         Ms. McCartney attended Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Arizona. While a student in Arizona, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in 1963.         Soon afterward, she took up photography, and in 1965 she returned to New York, where she began photographing rock groups, starting with the Dave Clark Five and the Rolling Stones. During the next few years she befriended and photographed dozens of rock stars, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Animals, Janis Joplin, the Mamas and the Papas, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead. A widely reproduced picture of the Beatles that she took at a press party for the release of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967 captured the group on the eve of its greatest artistic triumph.         Her photographs appeared in Rolling Stone and other rock magazines, and in 1992 she published several hundred of them as a book, ''Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.''         Ms. McCartney met her future husband while photographing the Beatles in London in 1967, and the pair carried on an occasional romance for more than a year. In September 1968, Mr. McCartney asked her to move to London, from which point they became inseparable. Although she took some stunning pictures of the Beatles at work, she left most of them unpublished until she assembled her ''Sixties'' book. Her photographs of Mr. McCartney, however, adorned some of his post-Beatles album covers, and in one of his early television specials, ''James Paul McCartney,'' he is shown singing a medley of his songs while his wife did a photo shoot.         In addition to Mr. McCartney and the daughter from her first marriage, Heather, Ms. McCartney is survived by three children from her marriage with Mr. McCartney: Mary, Stella and James; and by her brother John, who is now Mr. McCartney's lawyer and business manager, and two sisters, Laura and Louise.         Besides ''Sixties,'' Ms. McCartney published several other books, including ''Linda's Pictures,'' ''Sun Prints,'' ''Photographs'' and ''Road Works.'' Celebrities were by no means her only photographic subject. Plants, animals, natural patterns on rock faces and people she encountered on her travels engaged her interest and were captured with a touching refinement in many of her pictures. Her work has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, England, and at more than 50 galleries around the world.         Correction:  April 21, 1998, Tuesday  The obituary of the photographer Linda McCartney yesterday gave an incorrect name in some copies for the most recent studio album by her husband, the former Beatle Paul McCartney. It is ''Flaming Pie''; ''Off the Ground'' was the one before that.         Correction:  June 11, 1998, Thursday  The obituary of Linda McCartney on April 20 misstated her college background. She attended only the University of Arizona, not Sarah Lawrence College as well. The obituary also misstated the given name of her first husband in some copies. He was Melvin See, not Bob. The errors were pointed out in E-mail received from a reader yesterday.       
         Kathleen F. Connelly, a corporate crisis and public relations executive, died Sunday while vacationing in the Virgin Islands. She was 49.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, according to a spokesman for the Dilenschneider Group, the public relations firm in which Ms. Connelly was a principal.         Ms. Connelly was a bond trader and portfolio manager at Continental Bank in Chicago when Robert Dilenschneider, who had been sent by Hill & Knowlton to open its Chicago office in 1979, made her his first hire. The extraordinary success that followed propelled Mr. Dilenschneider to the top of Hill & Knowlton, the world's largest public relations firm, and Ms. Connelly rose to become its first female executive vice president and head of worldwide business development.         When Mr. Dilenschneider set up his new firm in 1991, Ms. Connelly became a co-founder and head of the Chicago office. Two years ago, she advised Mercury Finance through a high-profile financial scandal that nearly bankrupted the company, which at the time was the leading provider of auto loans to consumers with poor credit.         Kathleen Fitzgerald Connelly was born on Dec. 26, 1948, in Holyoke, Mass., the daughter of Thomas and Mary Fitzgerald. She earned a bachelor's degree from Newton College of the Sacred Heart in Newton, Mass., and a master's degree in political science from Rutgers University.         She is survived by her husband, Vincent Connelly, who is a partner at the Chicago law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt; two daughters, Courtney and Carleigh; a son, Robert; a sister, Mary Fitzgerald, and a brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, both of Arlington Heights, Ill.       
         Florence Skelly Altman, an innovator in opinion research, died on Tuesday at Scottsdale, Ariz., Memorial Hospital. She was 73 and lived in Scottsdale.         The cause of death was complications of heart disease, her daughter, Alexandra Altman, said.         Ms. Skelly, as she was known professionally, was instrumental in developing many techniques that are now standard in market research, including the use of simulated test markets to estimate the potential of new products. Today, variations of the method are used by major packaged goods marketing companies such as Procter & Gamble.         ''She had a great flair for the numbers side of the business, but saw the human implications of the numbers like no one I have ever known,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, a partner of Ms. Skelly at the opinion research firm that bore their names.         The social implications of Ms. Skelly's work were apparent in a study of younger Americans she and Mr. Yankelovich conducted in the late 1960's, among the first to call them baby boomers.         Arthur H. White, another partner and a professional colleague of Ms. Skelly for 50 years, said, ''The study revealed gender and race problems, that we had a society in which large segments of the population were not treated as well as other segments and that attitudes about institutions were changing.''         ''In those studies,'' he added, ''we saw that most people did not want to accept everything an employer or the Government said.''         Ms. Skelly had firsthand experience with sex discrimination early in her career. Mr. White recalled a meeting in the 1950's that he, Ms. Skelly and another male executive from Stewart Dougall, a New York research firm where she worked early on, were asked to attend with the board of the New York Stock Exchange. ''She had to sit outside in the hall while we, the two men, went in to talk,'' Mr. White said.         Suffering such indignities did little to dispel what her colleagues said was an admirable disposition.         ''She was a wonderful, witty person, very funny but serious at the same time, which is a great combination,'' Mr. Yankelovich said. ''Our clients loved her, and she loved the business.''         Ms. Skelly, a longtime resident of New York, moved to Scottsdale in the mid-1990's. She was a graduate of Hunter College, where her senior honors paper in social psychology, based on a public opinion survey of a Y.W.H.A. project in New York, exhibited her interest in market research.         She spent four years at Stewart Dougall, went to Washington for two years and worked on the 1950 Census, and then returned to the firm.         In 1961 she and Mr. White left to join Mr. Yankelovich. Later in the decade, the firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. was renamed Yankelovich, Skelly & White. In 1986, two years after the firm was bought by the  Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the advertising concern, Mr. Yankelovich, Ms. Skelly and Mr. White left to start another firm, citing policy disagreements.         Until her death Ms. Skelly served as vice chairwoman of the new firm, DYG Inc., based in Danbury, Conn. (Saatchi & Saatchi sold the former Yankelovich, Skelly & White, now Yankelovich Partners, in 1992.)         In recognition of her contributions to the field, in 1990 the Market Research Council inducted Ms. Skelly into its Market Research Hall of Fame.         Over the years Ms. Skelly served on numerous boards, including the National Council of Christians and Jews, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Business Advisory Board and the Warnaco Corporation.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Ms. Skelly is survived by her husband, Eugene Altman of Scottsdale, and a son, Jonathan Altman of Los Angeles.       
         Diana Epstein, a onetime New York book editor whose prosaic need to replace some plastic (ugh!) buttons on a stylish new jacket led her down a rabbit hole of miniature wonder into an enchanted world awash in buttons, died on April 3 at Beth Israel Hospital North near her tiny town house on the Upper East Side. She was 61 and a founding proprietor of Tender Buttons, the small East 62d Street shop devoted exclusively, ecstatically, extravagantly to buttons.         Her friend and business partner, Millicent Safro, said the cause was an infection contracted during treatment for the flu.         Until that fateful day in 1964 when she set out on her lunch hour to buy some decent buttons, Ms. Epstein had been a more or less normal New York career woman, albeit one with a decided artistic flair and a vague feeling that literature might not be her true calling.         A native of New York City who was adopted by an aunt, Ms. Epstein had grown up in Chicago, graduated from the University of Chicago and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago before coming to New York, where she held a series of editing jobs and tried her hand at writing, once taking off six months to work on a novel in Greece.         For all her soaring imagination, Ms. Epstein could never have dreamed up what happened to her after she arrived at the ramshackle East 77th Street shop where she had bought buttons before and found that the proprietor had died and the store was shuttered.         Acting on what she recalled only as an inspired whim, Ms. Epstein tracked down the owner's heirs, paid them $5,000 for the entire stock of several hundred thousand buttons dating to the 1930's, and then, with no place to keep them, rented the store, and, somewhat dazed by her impetuous investment, tried to figure out what to do next.         A few weeks later, at a party at the store for an artist friend, she got the answer: One of the guests was Ms. Safro, a young antiques restorer who took one look at Ms. Epstein and the jumble of crushed and torn cartons of buttons and decided to set them straight.         It was the beginning of a remarkable partnership, and by the time Ms. Safro had helped Ms. Epstein organize the hoard of buttons the friends had backed into a business they knew nothing about.         As Ms. Epstein later recalled, the women, who had no real notion of opening a business, made their first sale when one of the store's former customers wandered in one day and bought six red buttons for a penny apiece in what may or may not have been a bargain: The women had no idea what any of their buttons were worth, but they soon made a point to find out, reading virtually everything ever written about buttons, which date to ancient Egypt but have been a collecting craze only since the Depression, and pumping experts in the field.         By the time they moved the store to its present location, at 143 East 62d Street, in 1968, they had become experts themselves.         Ms. Epstein had published the first of her three books on buttons, and, to their eventual dismay, both had become so hopelessly hooked on buttons that selling a treasured set would make them cry.         Business is business, however, and they made the best of it, purchasing a series of important collections, making two extensive buying trips abroad each year and making their store such a valuable resource it was a wonder how such celebrity regulars as Joan Bennett, Candice Bergen, Bill Blass, Oleg Cassini, Julie Christie, Claudette Colbert, Catherine Deneuve, Greta Garbo, Rose Kennedy, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Ali MacGraw, Paloma Picasso, Sidney Poitier, Isabella Rossellini, Susan Sarandon, Brooke Shields, Carly Simon, William Styron and Tom Wolfe could have got by without them, not to mention Kermit the Frog.         (The two women, who delighted in tracking down Muppet buttons in the precise shade of Kermit green, also supplied the playing card buttons for Jack Nicholson's jacket as the Joker in ''Batman.'')         Although Ms. Epstein believed that the quality of the store's vast selection spurred designers to upgrade their buttons, it has not been unusual for a customer to go straight from, say, Bergdorf's to Tender Buttons to buy an even better set of buttons for a newly purchased dress or suit.         In a store with thousands of different blazer button designs and tens of thousands of unique sets, Ms. Epstein, who saw buttons as art, catered to both collectors and customers seeking a single replacement for a missing shirt button or a striking set for a new garment.         She was so familiar with her stock that she would go unerringly to the box holding the exact match for a customer's missing button on a pair of Brooks Brothers pajamas.         Ms. Epstein's personal credo was that buttons should never speak louder than the dress or jacket they adorn, no cinch, to be sure, in a store much of whose inventory fairly shouts, but then her own clothes tended to be handmade to her own design from fine fabrics purchased abroad.         Operating a store that is as much museum as emporium, its walls lined floor to ceiling with small gray boxes holding more than a million ancient, antique and modern buttons in a profusion of materials, shapes and sizes with designs ranging from miniature fine art to cut-down kitsch, seemed to stimulate Ms. Epstein's artistic talents.         A large woman of surprising grace, she developed an interest in all things small, and became famous among her friends for her miniature watercolor collages, which led to a line of button-adorned greeting cards (''Berry Christmas'').         She was also known for her ''little'' dinners, generally served on small plates on children's furniture, but once, for a visiting niece who really wasn't very hungry, she served up breakfast on doll house china.         Ms. Epstein, who is survived by two brothers, Mel and Sheldon Green, and a sister, Barbara Levin, all of Chicago, where Tender Buttons also has a store, made sure the business would survive her. Ms. Safro, her heir, said it would continue.       
         Belle Zeller, an emeritus professor of political science at Brooklyn College and a scholar of the legislative process who was an indomitable leader of unions representing City University of New York professors for more than 30 years, died on Friday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass.         From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress.         As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol.         ''When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,'' said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ''She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist.''         Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age.         She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors.         In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.         Her doctoral dissertation, ''Pressure Politics in New York'' (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act.         Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.         Dr. Zeller never married. In addition to Ms. Glass, she is survived by four other nieces and a nephew.       
         Jeanette Nolan, who began her film career 50 years ago as Lady Macbeth opposite Orson Welles and is now being seen as the mother of the character played by Robert Redford in ''The Horse Whisperer,'' died on June 5 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Miss Nolan, who lived in Hollywood, was 86.         She had suffered a stroke a week earlier, said her daughter, Holly Wright of Charlottesville, Va., and Manhattan.         Miss Nolan's 70-year career in acting also included roles in theater, radio and television.         In the 1930's, long before Montana became a popular hideaway for show business stars, Miss Nolan and her husband, John McIntire, an actor whom she married in 1935, maintained a log cabin in the Rockies 3 miles from the Canadian border and 14 miles from the nearest mail drop. There they watched the stars through a skylight in the roof, fished for trout off the back porch, bagged an occasional bear or deer for food, trapped beavers (whose fur became a coat for Miss Nolan) and weathered temperatures of 55 below zero. She baked her own bread, churned her butter and in one year, she said, put up 500 quarts of vegetables, fruit and venison.         When the couple needed to replenish their capital -- Mr. McIntire said all you needed in Montana was a $200-a-year grubstake -- they would come to New York and star in radio programs.         On Sunday nights, for example, Mr. McIntire was the ''Crime Doctor'' on CBS, and Miss Nolan the woman he psychoanalyzed. They appeared frequently on ''Cavalcade of America,'' where Miss Nolan once played Ann Rutledge to her husband's Abe Lincoln. Fridays would find them on Philip Morris's ''Perfect Crime.''         ''I might play the murderer and Jeanette the moll,'' Mr. McIntire said. ''Or things like that.''         Miss Nolan, who could produce an Irish dialect or Spanish, Italian, German or Russian accent on demand, also appeared on CBS's ''Big Sister'' series and ''The Court of Missing Heirs.'' The busy days of rehearsals and broadcasts often lasted 15 hours.         After Miss Nolan made her film debut in 1948 opposite Welles's Macbeth, she performed in well over 20 films, including ''Words and Music'' (1948), ''No Sad Songs for Me'' (1950), ''The Big Heat'' (1953), ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962), ''The Rescuers'' (1977), ''True Confessions'' (1981) and ''Cloak and Dagger'' (1984).         On television, where she earned four Emmy nominations, Miss Nolan appeared on more than 300 programs, including ''Perry Mason,'' ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ''Richard Diamond, Private Detective,'' ''I Spy,'' ''The F.B.I.,'' ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''MacGyver.'' She also had three series of her own: ''Hotel de Paree,'' ''The Richard Boone Show'' and ''Dirty Sally,'' a spinoff of ''Gunsmoke.''         Miss Nolan, one of three children of Ada and Edward Nolan, a union official, was born in Los Angeles in 1911. Short of money as a student of theater arts at Los Angeles City College in the Depression, she took a classmate's suggestion that she audition for a radio show. Asked if she could do a Scottish dialect, she did it and three others. She was hired at once and never stopped working.         Mr. McIntire died in 1991. Their son, Tim, also an actor, died in 1986 when he was 42. Besides her daughter, Miss Nolan is survived by her sister, Miriam Walker of Ashland, Ore., and a grandson.       
         Theresa Merritt, whose half-century career on television, in movies, on Broadway and in concert halls stretched from the original production of ''Carmen Jones'' to a recent episode of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' died on June 12 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 and lived in the Hollis section of Queens.         A spokesman for her family said Ms. Merritt died after a six-year battle with skin cancer.         Ms. Merritt is probably best known for two roles. Beginning in 1974, she starred in ''That's My Mama,'' an ABC situation comedy set in a Washington barbershop where a widowed mother knows best what her hapless son (played by Clifton Davis) should do. And on Broadway in 1984 she originated the title role of a domineering, manipulative blues singer in August Wilson's ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' earning a Tony nomination.         She was ''Ma Rainey incarnate,'' wrote Frank Rich in his review in The New York Times. ''A singing actress of both wit and power, she finds bitter humor in the character's distorted sense of self: when she barks her outrageous demands to her lackeys, we see a show business monster who's come a long way from her roots.''         Ms. Merritt was born in Emporia, Va., but moved to Philadelphia while a toddler to be reared by an aunt and uncle after her mother died. Yearning for a career as an opera singer, she studied at the Settlement School of Music in Philadelphia, and at Temple University and New York University.         As a teen-ager, she sang in church and community choirs and appeared on a radio show aimed at black audiences, ''Parisian Tailor's Colored Kiddie Hour.''         When she was 21, Ms. Merritt was chosen by Billy Rose, the Broadway producer, to join the cast of his 1943 musical, ''Carmen Jones.'' She played Frascetta.         Later, Ms. Merritt toured as a backup singer for Harry Belafonte and Jackie Wilson and sang at Carnegie Hall in 1985 as part of the Kool Jazz Festival and Salute to Cole Porter.         Her other New York stage roles included a gospel singer in ''Trumpets of the Lord'' in 1969; the understanding Southern maid in ''F. Jasmine Addams,'' a 1971 musical based on Carson McCullers's ''Member of the Wedding''; the wicked witch in ''The Wiz,'' and John Lithgow's black Polish landlady in ''Division Street,'' a 1980 farce by Steve Tesich.         Ms. Merritt acted in several films, including ''They Might Be Giants'' (1972), ''The Goodbye Girl'' (1977), ''All That Jazz'' (1979), ''The Great Santini'' (1979), ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (1982) and ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'' (1988).         She also appeared on numerous television series, including ''Beekman Place,'' ''Another World,'' ''Police Story'' and ''The Love Boat.'' In the last year, she played guest roles on ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' ''Cosby'' and ''Law and Order.''         Ms. Merritt is survived by her husband of 52 years, Benjamin Hines, and by four children, Norman, Benjamin Jr. and Denise, all of Hollis, and Dennis, of St. Louis.         In a 1984 interview, following her acclaimed opening in ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' Ms. Merritt said: ''I don't regret never being a big star. That can all go in seconds. I'm 62, and I've had a taste of it all.''       
         Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five  million copies, died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris. She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ''I Know How to Cook.''         In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain ring of defiance, and no wonder.         Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the restrictions from the beginning.         If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen.         Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.         She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline.         By her own account Miss Mathiot  garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't and bowed to her family's wishes.         After she established a life and career away from her family, the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them, she said, though for reasons of her own.         If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine.         While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science, including advances in nutritional understanding.         When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down, Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot, who said yes.         Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.         In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.         Like ''The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ''I Know How to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.         A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate survivors, never took anything for granted.         Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment, would have one more instruction: turn off the oven.       
         Catherine Kennedy, who after a  long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.         Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.         She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against  financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome  great odds.         After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.         But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.         The Governor was persuaded and,  with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.         In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall,  when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.         Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.         She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967.  Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.         It was through her affiliation with  Yale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in  AIDS medication and treatment.         Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half  of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival.  Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.         ''She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ''And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''       
         Erika Cheetham, an English medieval scholar who made a fortune translating the predictions of the 16th-century physician and astrologer Nostradamus, who gazed not only at the stars but also, legend had it, into a brass bowl of water to see visions of the future, died on May 3 in London. She was 58.         Her books, ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' ''The Further Prophecies of Nostradamus'' and ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' in which she claimed to have found predictions of the execution of  Charles I, the Great Fire of London, the Apollo 13 catastrophe and the spread of AIDS, sold in the millions.         They were on mass-market paperback best-seller lists for years in the United States, Britain and other countries, and, since the first book appeared in 1973, they have never been out of print.         Her good fortune came about because of a mistake at the Taylorian Library at Oxford, where she was working toward a doctorate in medieval languages. The librarian gave her the wrong book, the ''Propheties de M. Nostradamus.'' She found it fascinating and saw in it what she interpreted to be a prediction of World War II.         Michel de Notredame, the astrologer's real name, was also a traveling doctor from Provence, doing what was regarded as heroic work during plagues in Aix-en-Provence and Lyons. He produced several almanacs and a book of rhymed prophecies called ''Centuries,'' which has stayed in print through 300 editions. Before  his death in 1566, he had gained a wide following.         In the 33d quatrain of his fifth set of predictions, for example, a passage on the city of Nantes read: ''The city's leaders in revolt, will in the name of liberty, slaughter its inhabitants without regard to age or sex. There will be screams and howls and piteous sights.'' Two centuries later this was interpreted as a prophecy of the drownings of Nantes under the Committee of Public Safety in 1793.         But being a closet Lutheran in a time of the Inquisitions held to punish heretics, most of Nostradamus's prophesies were cryptic and written in a mix of archaic French, Latin, Greek, Italian or English. Translators contended that the quatrains contained codes, anagrams, hints and fragments of meaning that, put together, were predictions of coming events. A reference to a figure named Hister was taken as code for Hitler.         Erika McMahon-Turner was born in London on July 7, 1939, a daughter of wealthy parents, Eric A. Turner, Under Secretary to the Admiralty, and Helen Lilian McMahon Turner.  She attended a convent school but was expelled for writing an essay contending that God did not exist. She had an interest even then in the paranormal and the prophetic. Later, on gaining acceptance to St. Anne's College, Oxford, she cut a stylish, aristocratic figure, someone who went riding with the Aga Khan and married a Grenadier Guard, James Nicholas Milne Cheetham.         After receiving her Ph.D. she became a staff writer for The London Daily Mail. She wrote an article on Nostradamus in 1961 and two years later began translating his work in earnest.         Her first book appeared in 1965 and became an immediate hit, as did the other two. Her publishers at Corgi Books were now excited about Nostradamus as well. ''A very profitable business to be in,'' one was quoted as saying. ''Every publisher should have a Nostradamus title on their lists. And the beauty of it is that if you get one of Nostradamus's predictions wrong, you can always remove it from the next edition.''         Indeed, at the start of the 1990's at least 10 Nostradamus titles were in print, and with the advent of the Persian Gulf war, bookstores in Britain and the United States were selling out, with total sales tripling in some cases.         Ms. Cheetham, however, was ambivalent about the perspicacity of her hero. Claiming to be a linguist, a scholar and a skeptic, she once said: ''It's all rubbish, you know. Some of it is so vague and tortured and you could bend all sorts of events to fit.''         At other times she projected conviction: ''It's a question of all the portents coming together,'' she said in 1985, ''a pope with two attempts on his life, two brothers assassinated in the U.S.A. and the advent of Halley's comet.''         In her periods of skepticism, she was not alone. ''In a respectable London bookshop last week,'' wrote Francis Wheen in The Guardian in 1996, ''I was astonished to find an entire section given over to works by or about Nostradamus, the mumbo-jumbo merchant.'' The likely explanation, he said, was superstition linked to the approach of the year 2000.         Other nonbelievers in the more distant past included the Catholic Church, which in 1781 put ''Centuries'' on its index of condemned books.         Ms. Cheetham also wrote the screenplay of the 1982 film ''The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which Orson Welles played Nostradamus, and she was a contributor to periodicals and encyclopedias.         She was divorced in 1980, and is survived by a son, Alexander M. Cheetham.       
         Helen Carter, a singer and musician who was part of the Carter family dynasty of country-music entertainers, died on Tuesday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. She was 70 and lived in Dickson, Tenn.         She had been hospitalized for gastrointestinal problems that began over a year ago, said Kelly Hancock of House of Cash, the business office of Johnny Cash, Mrs. Carter's brother-in-law, and of her sister June Carter Cash.         The original Carter Family band, which helped kick-start the country-music record industry in 1927, was begun by A. P. Carter, a railroad worker and farmer from Maces Springs, Va.; his wife, Sara, and Sara's cousin, Maybelle. The band grew with the occasional addition of Maybelle's children, including Helen.         The family band lasted from 1927 to 1943, and it was of inestimable importance to American music.         It disseminated traditional songs, established a widely imitated small-group sound and built a set of templates that country, bluegrass and folk musicians would draw upon -- the mountain hymn, the love ballad, the cowboy tune and so on.         In 1943 Sara quit singing for good, and Maybelle started a new band, Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, with her daughters as permanent members.         Helen was 12 when she was introduced to the world over the airwaves of XET in Monterrey, Mexico, and in her teen-age years became the most dependable musician of her mother's band, playing accordion, guitar and autoharp.         It was a successful band, featured on ''The Old Dominion Barn Dance,'' a radio show based in Richmond, Va., in 1946; later it moved to the ''Tennessee Barn Dance,'' on Knoxville's WNOX. In 1950 the band joined the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville, and did some recording as a trio for Columbia records.         Helen Carter was a songwriter as well, writing ''Poor Old Heartsick Me,'' a hit for the singer Margie Bowes in 1959.         In the 1960's and 70's, she often appeared on radio and television not as a member of a working group but simply as a member of the famous clan. For example, she appeared on television with her sister June and  Mr. Cash.         In addition to her sister June, of Hendersonville, Va., she is survived by her husband, Glenn Jones of Dickson, Tenn.; another sister, Anita Carter of Goodlettsville, Tenn.; three sons, Glenn Daniel, David Lawrence, and Kevin Carter Jones, all of Dickson, and six grandchildren.       
         Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an important part in bringing about a significant change in New York State's divorce legislation, died early Wednesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four years.         The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at her home, said Janet Post, a friend.         Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New York State's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in 1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the rights of marital partners.         At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, based in Manhattan, where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.         She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years ago,  and remained head of her department until she moved to Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm and its matrimonial department.         While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state law. Committee members communicated with the State Legislature in Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to make the change.         Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage, even if title to the property -- a house for instance, or a business -- is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not have that legal right in New York State before the law was passed.         The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of the marital assets.         Ms. Perles's clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry B. Helmsley, the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.         Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.         She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona J. Shays, a close friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ''No one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they are.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.         She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz & Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Greenbaum Wolff & Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.         In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Betty Lehan Harragan, a writer, consultant and advocate for women's equality in the workplace, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was lung cancer, according to Kathleen Harragan, her daughter.         Betty Harragan's book ''Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for Women'' was published in 1977 by Rawson Associates; since then, more than one million copies have been published in paperback by Warner Books. The book is used in college undergraduate courses and business schools and was the basis for a television film of the same name starring Loretta Swit and Sam Waterston, broadcast by CBS in 1982 and 1985.         Another book by Ms. Harragan, ''Knowing the Score: Play-by-Play Directions for Women on the Job,'' was published by St. Martin's Press in 1983. Ms. Harragan also wrote articles and columns about careers for such magazines as Working Woman, Woman's Day, Mademoiselle and Savvy.         A 27-year member of the National Organization for Women, for which she frequently handled publicity and public relations, Ms. Harragan often addressed professional societies and seminars for female managers. She also testified before legislative committees on behalf of equal opportunity, equal rights and comparable pay for women.         A native of Milwaukee, she graduated from Marquette University in there in 1944. She received a master's degree in English literature in 1947 from Columbia University.         From 1950 to 1956, she edited employee publications for the New York Telephone Company and was a writer and publicist at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency from 1963 to 1972. Later that year, Ms. Harragan started Betty Harragan & Affiliates, a consulting company that specialized in women's issues in the workplace.         Her husband, David J., died in 1962.         In addition to her daughter, Kathleen, of Boston, she is survived by three brothers, Robert Lehan of Tempe, Ariz.; Richard Lehan of Sacramento, Calif., and William Lehan of Anaheim, Calif.; two sisters, Geri Pollack of North Hills, Calif., and Judy Ascasio of Laguna Hills, Calif., and a grandson.       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Sister Irene Kraus, a onetime schoolteacher with such a high-spirited talent for leadership and such hard-nosed business ability that she went on to run a series of hospitals and spend six years as the founding chief executive of the $3 billion Daughters of Charity National Health System, died Aug. 20 at a hospital in Baltimore. She was 74 and lived in Emmitsburg, Md., where she was administrator of her order's provincial headquarters.         Friends said the cause was cancer.         While it is tempting to speculate on what direction her life might have taken if she had not joined the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, in an era when women's horizons were bounded largely by home and family, it would be hard to find a secular career path that would have allowed her to become president of the nation's largest nonprofit hospital chain.         But then for Sister Irene, who grew up in Philadelphia, the religious life seems to have been a foregone family conclusion. Like her business acumen and her boundless good humor, her religious commitment seems to have come from her father, Frank, a Pennsylvania Railroad executive with a weakness for practical jokes and such a spiritual bent, his daughter later recalled, that ''he would pray all the way to work, and when I went with him, I would pray, too.''         A standout student at the Daughters of Charity's Elizabeth Seton High School in Baltimore, Sister Irene graduated at 17 in 1941 and immediately joined the religious order.         After a year of novitiate training, she spent seven years teaching elementary and high school students in Richmond. Then her superiors decided it was time for her to get a college education and asked her to switch to a medical career.         After earning a nursing degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1952, she quickly became an operating room supervisor, performing her duties at a series of hospitals with such efficiency and flair that three years later she was made administrator of Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y., the first of several hospitals nationwide she ran for the order.         When the five autonomous American provinces of the Daughters of Charity decided to consolidate their hospital systems in 1986, Sister Irene was the obvious choice to put the merger into effect and run the operation, which included three dozen hospitals and 19 other operations in 17 states with a combined annual budget of more than $3 billion.         And over the next six years, during a period of mounting fiscal and other pressures, she proved more than equal to the task of meshing often incompatible accounting and other systems into an efficient operation with common purchasing and other functions.         In addition to its embrace of women's potential, the religious order gave Sister Irene other advantages. In a business world where women have had to pick their way through contradictory advice on how to dress for success, Sister Irene never had a wardrobe worry. Whether conducting a board meeting or entertaining at a reception, she wore a version of the same understated habit, a simple blue dress, she had worn as an elementary school teacher.         If the men she encountered were unaccustomed to dealing with a hard-driving business woman in a habit, Sister Irene, a raconteur with an impish sense of humor, knew how to put them at ease and rarely stopped there. At stodgy gatherings, Sister Irene, a tall, imposing woman with a commanding laugh, would sometimes break into an impromptu dance. And when she got up from her seat at a formal dinner to ''work the room,'' Sister Irene would be easy to track: She inevitably left a trail of laughter in her wake.         During a career in which she served on more than 70 national boards and committees, Sister Irene became accustomed to being the only woman in the room. And in 1980, when she became the first woman to serve as chairman of the American Hospital Association, she headed off a move to call her chairwoman or chairperson. She told the board, ''I didn't work this hard to get here and have my title changed.''         For all her accomplishments as president of the national system, Sister Irene, who later ran a hospital in Pensacola, Fla., and was still vice chairman of the merged Baptist St. Vincent's Hospital system in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time of her death, said her proudest achievement was developing a five-point value system for the national chain. The first four, including treating people with respect and serving the impoverished, sounded like familiar religious principles. The fifth, ''Be Creative to Infinity,'' sounded exactly like Sister Irene.         Sister Irene is survived by three sisters, Gertrude Hunter and Maguerite Williams of Bel Air, Md., and Dolores Freeman of Willards, Md.       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.       
         Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide operation, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940's and 50's she was married to the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic American self-help book ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after Mr. Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates and $187 million in annual sales.         With her strawberry blond hair, gleaming smile and rich Oklahoma twang -- Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Mr. Carnegie as well as his wife -- she proved as big a success in business as he was in motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950's wondered whether she had what it took to continue Mr. Carnegie's quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took over the operations ''so that I have no time to sit and whittle and spit.''         Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.         In the early 1940's, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called an ''unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course at a Y.M.C.A. in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired for the jump she made from stenographer in the Gulf Oil Corporation's accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite. She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.         Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company offered her a job in New York. She became Mr. Carnegie's secretary in January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later made her his business partner.         Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case histories for a book she wrote, ''How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their husbands were such aphorisms as ''Share his interests and ideals'' and ''Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a wailing wall.''         But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and teaching interests. She once started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of women taking the regular course.         Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune 500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the confidence to present themselves well in public settings. Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.         Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics. So did Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of the Chrysler Corporation.         ''For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his autobiography, ''Iacocca.'' ''But that was before I took a course in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help of Carnegie teachers.         Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late 1960's.         Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa. She retired from active management of the closely held company in 1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she remained chairwoman.         She is survived by Mr. Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier. She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.       
         Rose Blumkin, who founded the Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1937, helped her son and grandchildren build it into the nation's largest home furnishings store and continued selling carpet there well past her 100th birthday, died on Friday in Omaha. She was 104.         Mrs. B, as she was fondly known by Midwesterners who often traveled hundreds of miles to Omaha to shop at the store, was known for her credo: ''Sell cheap, tell the truth, don't cheat nobody.'' In her last years, she moved around the cavernous store on a golf cart, sometimes startling visitors by abruptly zipping away toward customers who appeared to be waiting for attention.         Mrs. Blumkin stood just 4 feet 10 inches in her prime, but her merchandising skills and daring as she made the long journey from an impoverished childhood in Russia to success led figures like Warren E. Buffett to rank her as a business giant. At one point soon after founding her store, she sold every appliance and piece of furniture in her home to pay off a debt. When furniture manufacturers stopped selling directly to her after bigger customers in Omaha complained about her low retail prices, she traveled to Kansas City, Mo., Chicago and New York, bought from department stores and still undersold her rivals.         ''Put her up against the top graduates of the top business schools or chief executives of the Fortune 500 and, assuming an even start with the same resources, she'd run rings around them,'' Mr. Buffett said in 1984 soon after Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought majority control of the Furniture Mart from Mrs. Blumkin. Based on his experience as a customer and as an acquaintance of her children, Mr. Buffett made the acquisition on a handshake without bothering to audit her books or inventory.         Mrs. Blumkin was born Dec. 3, 1893, in Schidrin, a village near Minsk, one of eight children of Solomon and Chasia Gorelick. Her father was a rabbi, and her mother ran a grocery store to support the struggling family, which lived in a two-room log cabin and slept on straw mattresses. In interviews, Mrs. Blumkin recalled working in the store at age 6, talking her way into a job as a store clerk when she was 13 and becoming manager with six men working under her three years later.         Mrs. Blumkin was 20 when she married Isadore Blumkin, a shoe salesman, soon before he fled to the United States to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army. Although unable to speak English, Mrs. Blumkin managed to rejoin him in Fort Dodge, Iowa, three years later, and the young couple moved to Omaha in 1919, where Mr. Blumkin opened a secondhand clothing store.         The Blumkins had four children by the time the Depression struck. Mrs. Blumkin encouraged her husband to cut prices, helped him branch into new products and dreamed up innovative advertising. She started her own furniture business with $500 she borrowed from a brother.         Mrs. Blumkin's own nominee for the nation's greatest businessman was her son, Louis, who became her major ally in running the Furniture Mart after returning from military service in World War II. Like her, he typically put in seven-day, 70-hour workweeks. But she began to feel frozen out of decisions as her grandchildren, Irving and Ronald Blumkin, became more involved in the 1980's. She bitterly ''retired'' in 1989 at the age of 95, but after three months returned with characteristic combativeness, setting up a rival store called Mrs. B's Clearance and Factory Outlet across the street from the Furniture Mart. By 1991, it had become profitable and was Omaha's third-largest carpet outlet.         The family eventually repaired the rift, and Mr. Buffett acquired the new venture in 1992, merging it into the Furniture Mart. He later joked with reporters that it had been a mistake he would never repeat to let Mrs. Blumkin retire without signing an agreement not to compete.         Mrs. Blumkin's husband died in 1950. She is survived by her son, Louis; three daughters, Frances Batt, Cynthia Schneider and Sylvia Cohn; two sisters, Anne Rosenblatt and Ruth Lasher, all of Omaha; a brother, Mayer Gorelick of Los Angeles; 12 grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.       
         Sybil Harrington, a philanthropist from Amarillo, Tex., who besides supporting medical, education and arts charities was the largest individual donor to the Metropolitan Opera in the company's history, died on Thursday in Phoenix, where she kept a winter home. She was 89.         Grand opera was her passion, Mrs. Harrington once told an interviewer from Town and Country magazine. ''It's all there -- beautiful sets, great costumes, great music,'' she said. ''What more could you want?''         And Mrs. Harrington liked her grand opera grand. Other patrons could back productions of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' and Britten's ''Peter Grimes.'' Her tastes went to Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and Mozart. She made possible some of the Met's most lavish and popular productions, like Franco Zeffirelli's ''Boheme,'' ''Tosca'' and ''Turandot'' and Otto Schenk's ''Meistersinger.'' She financed 16 new productions in total, most recently the Elijah Moshinsky production of Verdi's ''Otello'' introduced in the 1993-94 season. She also supported 13 ''Metropolitan Opera Presents'' television broadcasts, and provided funding for the company's computerized lighting board.         In 1980, Mrs. Harrington made a  gift of $20 million to the Metropolitan Opera endowment fund campaign. In acknowledgement of her extraordinary generosity, the company named the house's auditorium after her.  Marilyn Shapiro, the executive director for external affairs at the Met, estimated that Mrs. Harrington's donations to the Met totaled more than  $30 million.         As a director of the foundation she formed with her husband, Donald D. Harrington, a Texas oil man, Mrs. Harrington also contributed large sums to dozens of diverse charities and organizations, including the Deafness Research Foundation in New York and the Harrington Arthritis Research Center in Phoenix. She was especially attentive to the needs of the Texas Panhandle, providing money for everything from outdoor lights for softball fields in small towns like Gruver to a cancer treatment center outside Amarillo.         Mrs. Harrington was a fierce defender of private philanthropy over government support. ''We've got to have that free enterprise,'' she once said. ''It's important in charitable institutions as well as in business. Art has to have freedom.''         Mrs. Harrington was born Sybil Buckingham in Amarillo in 1908, the granddaughter of some of the first settlers in the remote region. As a child, she liked to fish and shoot, but she especially loved music and dance. She studied piano and organ, and ordered ballet shoes from a catalogue, persuading her mother to take her to Fort Worth for dance classes. Later, she loved listening to the first radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, which fired her love for the art form and the company.         A petite woman with a wry smile and quick wit, she married Mr. Harrington in 1935. They bought a 15,000-square-foot home in Amarillo built in 1914 by a cattle baron who, Mrs. Harrington often recalled, had had the grand Ionic columns that supported the portico hauled to Amarillo by mule train.         The couple's philanthropy began with some scholarships to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and later with a ranch they bought and turned into the Don Harrington Boy Scout Camp. They established their foundation in 1961.         In 1974, Mrs. Harrington suffered two blows, the deaths of both her husband and, a few months later, their only child, Sally Harrington Goldwater, the wife of Robert Goldwater, the younger brother of Senator Barry Goldwater. Taking charge of the foundation was one way she  was able to cope with her loss.         She had been a regular contributor to the Met but had not thought of financing a production until it was suggested to her by friends on the Met's board. Her first gift made possible the production of Verdi's ''Don Carlo'' by John Dexter, introduced in the 1978-79 season. Mrs. Harrington immersed herself in the experience, attending rehearsals, talking with  cast and crew, dispensing advice. When someone suggested that a white horse and some Irish wolfhounds in one scene were distracting, Mrs. Harrington objected, and the animals remained in the cast.         Other productions she was responsible for, still in use by the company, include Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut,'' Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' Wagner's ''Rheingold'' and Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' She became a member of the Metropolitan Opera Association in 1968, a director of its managing board in 1970 and advisory director in 1978.         She is to be buried in Amarillo.         Commenting once on her work as a philanthropist, Mrs. Harrington said: ''Giving money away is hard work. But I got a kick out of it. I felt important for once in my life.''       
         Mary Frann, an actress best known for playing the wife of the comedian Bob Newhart in his second successful CBS series, ''Newhart,'' died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 55.         The cause was not officially determined as of yesterday, though Ms. Frann, whom friends reported had been in good health, apparently died in her sleep.         For eight seasons in the 1980's, Ms. Frann played Joanna Loudon, the pleasant, stable wife of the often harried Dick Loudon, the character played by Mr. Newhart. The Loudons had moved from New York to Vermont to run a small inn and were surrounded by colorful New England types like George, a slow-moving caretaker, and a handyman threesome of brothers from the backwoods, two of whom were named Darryl, for no apparent reason. Only the third brother, Larry, ever spoke.         Ms. Frann was a more or less traditional sitcom wife dropped into the center of these offbeat and bizarre characters. While Mr. Newhart's character was often exasperated by the encounters with eccentricity, Ms. Frann's Joanna was more often bemused by them.         Mr. Newhart said: ''I played a sort of Everyman character and she was the wife of Everyman. That can be a tough road to hoe.'' Referring to the classic comedy ''I Love Lucy,'' Mr. Newhart said: ''If Mary was Lucy, the show would not have worked. She had to be grounded.''         ''Newhart'' is perhaps best remembered for its wildly original concluding episode, which ended with Dick Loudon getting hit in the head with a golf ball, losing consciousness and waking up in bed. The bed was the one Mr. Newhart used in his previous series, ''The Bob Newhart Show,'' and next to him in the bed was Suzanne Pleshette, who played his wife in that show. The scene indicated that the eight years of ''Newhart'' had all been a dream.         ''I think Mary had a little problem with that,'' Mr. Newhart said. ''But we were all thrilled at how the audience reacted when we did it.''         In the years since the ''Newhart'' show ended, Ms. Frann worked mainly as a guest star in other series and television movies. Earlier in her career, she had a four-year run on the NBC daytime soap opera ''Days of Our Lives.''         Born in St. Louis, Ms. Frann began a career in show business as a child model. She attended Northwestern University on a scholarship from the Junior Miss Foundation, majoring in drama. After her work on ''Days of Our Lives'' Ms. Frann had a starring role in 1982 in a series called ''Kings Crossing'' on ABC.         Ms. Frann, who is survived by two sisters, Patricia Sauve and Jacqueline Rogers, and a brother, Harry Luecke, all of Los Angeles, was also active in charity work. Her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said she was most involved with the Los Angeles Mission, where she worked with women in  rehabilitation from problems with drugs, alcohol or prostitution.         Mr. Lane said Ms. Frann helped form a ''celebrity women's action committee'' with a group of other female television stars including Diahann Carroll, Donna Mills, Linda Gray and Joan Van Ark.         ''I always told Mary she was the glue that held it all together,'' Mr. Newhart said.       
         Fiamma di San Giuliano Ferragamo, a designer who helped develop one of the most famous shoe labels in fashion, died on Monday at her home in Florence. She was 57. She died of cancer, said Ferrucio Ferragamo, her brother and chief executive officer of Salvatore Ferragamo Italia.         For almost 40 years Fiamma Ferragamo was responsible for the design of the famed Ferragamo shoes and leather accessories, helping to build Ferragamo from a custom shoemaker for the elite to a global fashion powerhouse with a network of boutiques in New York, Milan, London and Paris. In 1996 the company had become so robust it was able to scoop up the Emanuel Ungaro company.         Ms. Ferragamo pursued her vigorous activities for her family company in defiance of doctors' prognostications a decade ago after she underwent surgery for breast cancer. ''She went against all the predictions at the beginning,'' Ferruccio Ferragamo said yesterday. ''They thought it was only a question of a few months and she made it 10 years.''         As executive vice president and a board member of the Ferragamo company, Ms. Ferragamo played a central role in the business, attending meetings as recently as two weeks ago with her five siblings and her mother, Wanda, the chairman, said Ferruccio Ferragamo.         Ms. Ferragamo prided herself on the comfort and elegance of the Ferragamo shoe, values she inherited from her father, Salvatore, who founded the firm in 1927.         Ms. Ferragamo's most successful shoe design, a round-toe low-heeled pump with grosgrain ribbon and gold buckle stamped with the family signature, became a badge of executive propriety and country club chic. Even though Ms. Ferragamo designed the Vara -- as she called the model -- in the 1960's, the shoe has never lost its appeal and remains a wardrobe staple for many conservative white-collar women in much the same way the Oxford wingtip is for white-collar men.         Ms. Ferragamo was born in Florence in 1941, the eldest of three boys and two girls. She began working for the company at 16 when her father had already established it as one of the most prestigious names in shoes. At one point it seemed that there was no foot in royal Europe or royal Hollywood that Mr. Ferragamo had not dressed -- from Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren and Greta Garbo to the Duchess of Windsor, Queen Elena of Italy and, as he pointed out in ''Shoemaker of Dreams,'' his 1957 autobiography, Eva Braun.         Ms. Ferragamo inherited his mantle when she was only 19. When he was dying of cancer, Salvatore Ferragamo left her in charge while he sought treatment in the United States. He died in 1960.         Ms. Ferragamo believed in promotion as well as creation and she spent weeks flying around the United States selling her product in stores.         In 1967 she received the Neiman Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion, 20 years after her father was similarly honored.         When she was not designing or plotting acquisitions, Ms. Ferragamo served on the board of the Italian Environmental Fund, which protects historic Italian houses. She loved entertaining in her home and shopping for the home even more. She adored nights at the opera. A regular visitor with her husband, Giuseppe di San Giuliano, to the Salzburg Festival, she would not miss a night of the Maggio Musicale season in Italy directed by Zubin Mehta, a frequent guest in her home.         An ear for music was augmented with a nose for marmalade, as  Ms. Ferragamo developed her own recipe for the orange jam, which is sold by the jar in Japan.         In addition to her husband, her mother and her brother, she is survived by a son, Diego, two daughters, Giulia and Maria, two other brothers, Leonardo and Massimo, a sister, Fulvia Visconti Ferragamo, all of Florence; and another sister, Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, of Milan. All are officers of the company.         Ms. Ferragamo's successor at the company has not been named, said Ferruccio Ferragamo. A team of designers that reported to her will continue to design the line.         Ms. Ferragamo pursued her passions to the last. On a typical shopping jaunt here in May, she was unstoppable. ''We did Banana Republic, always Saks, Gracious Home was like a candy store to her,'' said Helen O'Hagan, a friend and former Saks executive. ''Here she is -- I'm falling on my face -- straight out of chemo. We went to one of those antique shows at the pier and she would be there in four-inch heels and ahead of the pack.''       
         Sarah Korein, who acquired some of the choicest real estate in Manhattan through bare-knuckle tactics cloaked by grandmotherly charm, died on Thursday at the North Division of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Elysabeth Kleinhans, a lawyer who manages the real estate business with other family members.         Even in a city in which real estate is a popular obsession on a par with sports and soap operas, Mrs. Korein (KO-reen) was almost unknown outside professional circles -- exactly as she preferred it. Her name rarely appeared in public.         And the face that she did present was more Dresden doll than Machiavellian negotiator. But buyers or sellers who assumed they were sitting across the table from sweetness and light did so at their peril.         ''She was the toughest deal maker imaginable,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and management concern. ''She squeezed out every last penny.''         Mrs. Korein could even profit from property she never owned.         In the early 1960's, for instance, she put a $250,000 deposit down on the Osborne Apartments, 205 West 57th Street. Advised against consummating the purchase because the building had no long-term investment value, she had to figure a way out of the deal.         So she reached out to a reporter for The New York Times to say that she planned to demolish the Osborne and replace it with a new tower, her son, Dr. Julius Korein, recalled.         When tenants besieged her office the next day, she comforted them. ''I don't want to take anyone's home away,'' she insisted, offering to sell them the contract. They paid her $500,000, not only taking her off the hook but also leaving her $250,000 richer.         ''She certainly was one of the best negotiators I've ever met,'' said the developer William Zeckendorf Jr. ''Perhaps in the beginning, people didn't take her seriously enough. It didn't take them long to find out.''         A common story in the real estate industry was that Mrs. Korein would keep different buyers in separate rooms and shuttle back and forth among the parties until she had extracted the terms she sought.         ''Even into her old age, everyone thought she was a charming, lovely little woman,'' her daughter said. ''Let me tell you, that's not where she was.''         Mrs. Korein's trophies speak for themselves.         At her death, her properties -- either land alone or both land and building -- included Lever House, the modernist landmark at 390 Park Avenue, between 53d and 54th Streets; the old Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, between Cedar and Pine Streets, a tower so gargantuan that it inspired New York's first zoning law in 1916, and One Penn Plaza on Seventh Avenue, between 33d and 34th Streets, the fifth-largest office building in the city.         She also owned the Delmonico Hotel, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street; the Swiss Center, 606 Fifth Avenue, at 49th Street, and two apartment towers on Central Park South, Nos. 220 and 240, overlooking Columbus Circle.         Mrs. Korein bought and sold the Beresford Apartments, 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82d Streets; the former Croyden Hotel, 12 East 86th Street, at Madison Avenue; the former Fifth Avenue Hotel, 24 Fifth Avenue, at Ninth Street, and the Schwab House apartments, a full-block complex between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, 73d and 74th Streets.         The family will not estimate the size and value of her portfolio, and not only because owners are customarily loath to disclose such things (tax assessors read the newspapers). Rather, Mrs. Korein held a variety of positions with any number of partners, making it difficult to apportion her share.         Whatever the bottom line, there was no question that she was wealthy and tough -- a ''great realtor,'' in the words of Leona Helmsley, perhaps the only figure to whom she might immediately be likened.         Ms. Tighe said Mrs. Korein was ''always an object of fascination, certainly to women coming up in the business but even to men, because there was no one else of her gender who accomplished what she did when she did.''         But while both Mrs. Korein and Mrs. Helmsley were known for being as aggressive as necessary to survive in the male-dominated industry, there was a significant difference: Mrs. Korein created her portfolio from scratch.         Sarah Rabinowitz was born in Germany and reared in Palestine, where she met Isidor Korein, a Hungarian engineer who arrived there after World War I. They married and immigrated to the United States in 1923.         In 1931, for $6,000, the Koreins bought a six-story apartment house in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn -- not as an investment but so that family members would have a place to live rent free.         Their first substantial investment, in 1941, was a large apartment building at 8701 Shore Road in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. To make the units more attractive, Mrs. Korein bought dozens of refrigerators and stored them in the building's emptied-out swimming pool.         With the advent of World War II, refrigerator production virtually ended as industry retooled for military needs. So Mrs. Korein was able to sell the refrigerators at a high profit. And because of the shortage of apartments, she was able to rent up the Shore Road building even without the new refrigerators.         ''One of her major secrets was somehow being in the right place at the right time with the right goods,'' Ms. Kleinhans said.         After the war and against her husband's wishes, Mrs. Korein pursued investment in Manhattan, beginning with 715 Park Avenue, an apartment building on the southeast corner of 70th Street. In time, she advised Francis Cardinal Spellman, the Archbishop of New York, on real estate, her children said.         Mrs. Korein made use of the nonamortizing mortgage, under which she would pay slightly higher interest rates but nothing toward principal, thus freeing cash for further investments. By the time the loan itself came due, her properties typically had appreciated so much in value that Mrs. Korein could easily pay off the amount.         ''All of her properties, without exception, did nothing but increase in value,'' said Andrew J. Singer, the chairman of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, who arranged financing for Mrs. Korein over many years.         Mr. Korein died in 1976. But even when he was alive, Mrs. Korein was the ''driving force,'' said Lawrence Friedland, the family's lawyer.         In the 1960's, he recalled, Mrs. Korein was about to sign a contract for the Beresford. At the last minute, her partners balked, fearing the risk of buying such a big building in what was then a rough-and-tumble neighborhood. She signed the contract anyway and more than doubled her money when she sold the property a few years later, Mr. Friedland said.         Perhaps Mrs. Korein's biggest false step was a foray into development in 1972, when she built an apartment house, the Elysabeth, 35 East 38th Street, between Park and Madison. It was not a success and she did not build again.         Besides Ms. Kleinhans and Dr. Korein, both of Manhattan, Mrs. Korein is survived by her sister, Esther Kessler of Naples, Fla.; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.         ''Into her 90's -- and I'm talking this year -- she would ask about cap rates and internal rates of return,'' Ms. Tighe said. ''She never lost her fascination with the business.''         Correction:  November 12, 1998, Thursday  An obituary on Nov. 4 about Sarah Korein, a New York real estate investor, referred incorrectly to her financing arrangements. Mrs. Korein was represented from 1977 to 1995 by Ackman Brothers & Singer, in which Lawrence D. Ackman and Andrew J. Singer were partners. Mr. Ackman arranged her financing before and after that time.       
         Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career to become a successful publicist, then an even more successful manager of concert artists and finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City Center and other stages, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home, across the street from City Center. She was 96.         Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and entertained audiences there from the 1940's through the 60's.         Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer, Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser, Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.         The productions were quite polished. Indeed, after an opening of one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple received a floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, ''We wish last night had been the Broadway opening.''         In her day, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female producers; the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene Selznick. She was as tough as they were, a woman in perpetual motion, but she did not seem that way.         ''Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said Robert Whitehead, the producer. ''She had a great determination to get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She was an extraordinary person.''         Franchot Tone, an actor whose work Miss Dalrymple always admired, thought of her as ''the tenderest little lady.'' But a writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer described as her as ''as fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense of timing like a Garand rifle.''         In addition to luring actors, she was also able to persuade producers to give the City Center sets and costumes when their plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her revival of ''My Fair Lady'' featured the original costumes.         Creating a 'Temple' For Performing Arts         City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard, was established on West 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to be a ''temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a top price of $2.         Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning. Her success with their dream was such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and called itself ''a glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens of extraordinary musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought the phrase an understatement of what Miss Dalrymple had accomplished.         Initially serving as volunteer director of public relations and as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple remained at the middle of City Center's publicity apparatus even after she started producing and directing. At the same time, she served as personal manager to performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, Mary Martin, Jose Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily Pons.         Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J., to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War, had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family very well.         When she was 9, she finished a short story, ''The Spinning Top,'' and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this success, she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving $5 for each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as secondary to her goal of becoming a stage director.         After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved to New York, studied secretarial skills at a business school and got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when she was only 16. She even made a respectable sum in the market before the crash of 1929. The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and into vaudeville. She created an act with her beau Dan Jarrett and worked with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit.         During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ''Salt Water,'' written with Mr. Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was hired by Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent, and her skill in handling the press so impressed him that he encouraged her to work at it full time.         It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the drama critic for The New York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. It was not a successful union, but in the five years they were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ''It Happened in New York,'' which was made into a movie by Universal Pictures.         Miss Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder, who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral will be held on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. at the West Point chapel.         Miss Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American Theater Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939 she was its first publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained speakers who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door Canteen.         By 1940, Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press agent, much sought after because of her contacts. Among the Broadway plays for which she handled the publicity were ''Mr. and Mrs. North'' (1941), ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943)  and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1944).         In 1945, she turned to producing. Her first effort, a collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ''Hope for the Best,'' a comedy by William McCleery, who had been Sunday editor of the newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity business but pursued more producing ventures, among them ''Brighten the Corner'' (1945) and ''Burlesque'' (1946).         Meanwhile, she began to devote more of her energy to developing productions for the newly formed City Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over by the city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for its occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations.         Early productions included Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' mostly because it required no scenery and was inexpensive to produce, and ''Porgy and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was completing a national tour.         Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of ''Porgy.'' ''I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its original form and present it exactly as as George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she once recalled.         One Misstep, Angering Sartre         In her 1975 memoir, ''From the Last Row,'' she recalled that Howard Taubman of The New York Times ''loved it'' but that Judith Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the original Broadway version. ''I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said, ''and told her she had a tin ear.'' She was pleased that this production of ''Porgy'' sold out and that ''Miss Crist never held my impulsive letter against me.''         In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when she succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce his play ''Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel Taradash called ''Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing Charles Boyer to make it his first Broadway role.         What began as a coup threatened to become a coup de grace; Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after he gave Miss Dalrymple the go-ahead and was filled with loathing for it. He loudly denounced it publicly as ''a vulgar, common melodrama with an anti-Communist bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson echoed Sartre's denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that it was a production that ''looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly closed.         But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word of her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State Department asked her to arrange for what the United States would offer at the Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958 the State Department called on her again, this time to arrange for the performances sent by the United States to the Brussels World's Fair, including those by Harry Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose Iturbi and the Juilliard String Quartet.         In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Richard III'' and ''Charley's Aunt.'' To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Mr. Ferrer and all the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity minimum.         Mr. Ferrer called the center ''this happy beehive of the arts,'' and donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and box-office success. ''They have made the theater seem like a fresh, exciting, varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times.         In 1956 Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in ''King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Both productions earned critical praise.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the villain), ''Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse in the title role), ''Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ''The Pajama Game.''         When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 1960's, however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal crises.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography, ''September Child'' (1963), ''Careers and Opportunities in the Theater'' (1969), ''Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook'' (1971) and ''The Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973).         As a producer, Miss Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit handling of the press, which is critical in the success of even the most expertly produced play. ''I never went in for theme parties or the crazy events that publicists stage today,'' she said in 1993. ''I simply advertised the facts of the production. At City Center, that was always enough.''       
         Luba Elianoff, a Latvian-born little old linen lady whose bearing was a bit too regal, whose spirit was a bit too fiery and whose embroideries were a bit too elegant to be called that to her face, died on Nov. 17 at her apartment on Riverside Drive. She was 96 and had much preferred to be called the Queen of Linens.         A full 50 inches tall in her prime, Mrs. Elianoff, who had shrunk somewhat by the time she retired at 86, may not have had the stature of a queen, but during the more than four decades she spent designing and manufacturing delicately embroidered towels, sheets, pillowcases and the like, no one ever accused her of not charging queenly prices.         Still, for a woman who catered to those who routinely paid several hundred dollars for a set of sheets, Mrs. Elianoff, who worked in a second-floor studio above what is now the Fairway fruit and vegetable market at Broadway and 75th Street, was remarkably democratic.         It was she, after all, who claimed to have been the first to persuade the Swiss embroidery industry, which handled her production, to work in polyester rather than cotton, a high-maintenance material better suited to the dwindling number of households whose staffs included maids and laundresses.         For all that, when it came to decorating sheets with borders of a range of intricate, imaginative designs, Mrs. Elianoff drew the line at substituting printed (shudder!) fabrics for stitching.         The daughter of a prosperous Latvian businessman, Mrs. Elianoff, a Riga native whose maiden name was Levitt, learned to sew as as child, but her girlhood heart belonged to the theater. At 16, when the Russian empire was in the throes of collapse, she escaped military patrols by hiding in a hay cart and made her way to Moscow, where she studied drama under Stanislavsky and others.         It was a sideline, as an English tutor, that changed her life twice over, leading her both to Martin Elianoff, a lawyer who became her husband, and to Armand Hammer, the American businessman who helped the couple immigrate to the Philippines in 1930.         In Manila, she began managing and later bought a chic fashion boutique catering to the city's American and European elite. When Mrs. Elianoff began supplementing its line of fine imports with embroideries made of an indigenous pineapple fiber known as pina, her customers were captivated by her designs. The Philippine Government was so delighted with her efforts to bolster the local economy that it awarded her a series of medals.         With war clouds looming (and many of her Western clients being evacuated) Mrs. Elianoff brought  her daughter, Anna Lou, to the United States in March 1941.         After a brief reunion when the war was over, she and her husband separated but never divorced. He died in 1982.         After working in a series of Manhattan linen shops, Mrs. Elianoff soon struck out on her own, using a sewing machine in her Riverside Drive apartment to embroider satin lingerie and hosiery cases for sale in local stores.         It was not until full domestic textile production resumed in 1946 that Mrs. Elianoff expanded into sheets, towels, pillowcases and shower curtains, typically buying stock sheets at wholesale prices, replacing the standard border with lace and other elaborate embroidery and reselling them to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor at what seemed to some exorbitant prices.         As one store buyer once told her:  ''That's not a price. It's a telephone number.''         Still, Mrs. Elianoff found such an enthusiastic market for her Luba Elianoff line of luxury linens that she soon had to move her business to her Broadway workroom, where a staff handled the sewing.         In time, demand for her elegant work grew so strong that about 200 stores carried her line, and she contracted out the manufacturing of borders to Swiss factories.         Partly because Mrs. Elianoff was such a perfectionist that she did most of her design work in Switzerland, where she worked closely with production specialists, and partly because her local production staff used a special flat seam that made the attached borders seem like a natural extension of the mass-produced sheet, she was widely recognized as one of the finest designers of decorative linens.         Always open to change, when Wamsutta began producing sheets in a variety of colors, Mrs. Elianoff responded enthusiastically, her once dainty designs blossoming into big, bold flowers and other colorful designs.         As an American citizen, Mrs. Elianoff began to see herself as more than the Queen of Linens. Recalling that as a teen-ager she had made a flag for a Zionist parade in Riga, she came to regard herself as the Betsy Ross of Zionism.         She is survived by her daughter, Anna Lou Aldrich of Manhattan, five granddaughters and two great-grandsons.       
         Mary Benjamin, an autograph dealer with such an authoritative eye for authenticity and such a sure sense of value that for decades she virtually dictated prices United States collectors paid for the writings of Presidents, poets and other prominent people, died on Monday at her home in Hunter, N.Y. She was 93 and had been so widely recognized as the nation's leading document authority that she regularly received mail addressed simply to ''The Autograph Lady.''         As a daughter of Walter R. Benjamin, a onetime New York Sun reporter who founded what is now the nation's oldest autograph dealership in Manhattan in 1887, Miss Benjamin, a native of Yonkers who graduated from Barnard, did not so much inherit her expertise as absorb it by osmosis during a 13-year apprenticeship at her father's elbow.         By the time she took over Walter R. Benjamin Autographs in 1940, Miss Benjamin had become so familiar with the handwritings of Presidents, cabinet secretaries, signers of the Declaration of Independence, Civil War generals and American and European composers, literary figures and the like that she could often tell at a glance not only if a document was authentic but which master forger had produced it if it was not.         Her expertise was so respected that once, when an auctioneer at a leading Manhattan gallery announced to the assembled bidders that the next item would be a George Washington letter, an audible snort of derision from Miss Benjamin was enough to cause the auctioneer to withdraw the document from the sale on the spot. As her snort had indicated, she had gotten a quick look at the letter moments earlier and recognized it as a forgery.         At a time when there were only a handful of dealers who handled autographs -- a term, meaning ''self-writing,'' that applies to anything, not simply the signature, written in a person's own hand -- Miss Benjamin's standing tended to overshadow her role as the only woman in the field.         Because of her reputation, experienced collectors and those with trunks full of old papers tended to seek her out, but Miss Benjamin was never satisfied with walk-in trade.         When it came to tracking down valuable documents, she was very much the daughter of the man who catapulted himself into the first ranks of his field in 1907. Learning that the Customs Service had sold 140 tons of old documents to a junk dealer, he persuaded the man to let him go through the refuse and ended up paying 25 cents each for thousands of documents signed by Presidents.         Similarly, when Miss Benjamin learned that the publishers of ''The Dictionary of American Biography'' had cleaned out its files of questionnaires filled out by 25,000 prominent Americans over two decades, she tracked down the junk dealer in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who had picked them up and ended up acquiring hundreds of them, including three separate intimate questionnaires that had been filled out by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Aside from a photographic memory that allowed her to recognize a handwriting she had not seen in years and to rattle off obscure biographic details of more than 10,000 notable figures of the previous 500 years, Miss Benjamin, who bought and sold between 5,000 and 10,000 documents a year and maintained an inventory of some 50,000 documents in her office vaults, had an uncanny sense of their value in the market of the moment.         A woman whose passions could be inflamed by a surprise discovery, Miss Benjamin, a crack bridge player, once likened the thrill of opening a trunk of old letters to the feeling of anticipation she felt at picking up a hand at the bridge table.         In her 40's when she married Harold G. Henderson, a Columbia professor of Japanese art who had served on General MacArthur's staff and composed Emperor Hirohito's renunciation of divinity, Miss Benjamin soon drew her husband into her scholarly detective work. On weekends the couple, wearing kimonos, would sit in the backyard of their Manhattan town house reading old manuscripts.         They also became famous for dinner parties whose regular guests included the likes of Georgia O'Keeffe.         A boom in autograph collecting in the 1960's brought her more competition, but Miss Benjamin, whose oft-revised 1946 book, ''Autographs: A Key to Collecting,'' has been regarded as a standard in the field, remained a figure to be reckoned with.         After her husband's death, she moved her business to Hunter, about 40 miles southeast of Albany, in 1974 and continued to be active until 1995. It is now operated by her nephew Christopher Jaeckel, who became her assistant in 1971.         In addition to Mr. Jaeckel, Miss Benjamin is survived by a sister, Yolanda Jaeckel of Cranbury, N.J.; another nephew, Theodore Jaeckel of Princeton Junction, N.J., and a niece, Pamela Oppen of Hunter.       
         Hazel Bishop, who cooked up the first kissproof lipstick (''stays on you . . . not on him'') in a kitchen fitted out as a laboratory, then lost the right to use the name she made famous, died on Saturday at the Osborn Home in Rye, N.Y. She was 92.         She exploited the skills of a research chemist, a merchant and a teacher to achieve eminence in three careers over the course of 50 years.         It was soon after World War II that Miss Bishop, a trained chemist who had worked in a dermatologist's laboratory, developed a nondrying, nonirritating, long-wearing lipstick. (Long-lasting types contain high amounts of colorants called bromo acids that have staining qualities.)         In 1950, she formed Hazel Bishop Inc. to manufacture and market her discovery. ''Never again need you be embarrassed by smearing friends, children, relatives, husband, sweetheart,'' the early advertising said, pointing out that older formulations tended to leave greasy marks on glasses, cigarettes and teeth. And the new brand did not have to be applied several times a day.         The brand found instant acceptance. When it was introduced that summer at $1 a tube, Lord & Taylor sold out its stock on the first day. The brand soon captured 25 percent of the fast-growing lipstick market and locked horns with Charles Revson of Revlon in ''the lipstick war.''         But Miss Bishop was engaged in a war of her own with her majority stockholder over financial issues. In settling her lawsuit, she left the company in 1954, when its sales exceeded $10 million a year. She set up Hazel Bishop Laboratories to develop household and personal care products, but ran into legal problems with her former partner, losing the right to sell products under her own name or to use it in personal appearances.         In 1962, she became a stockbroker for Bache & Company and later a financial analyst for Evans & Company. With the burgeoning of the fragrance business in the 1960's and 70's, cosmetics companies became hot stocks and her advice was ardently sought. She was quoted in newspaper financial pages and lectured throughout the United States.         Her third career was in fashion education. In 1978, she became an adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan in a program preparing young people for careers in cosmetics.         In 1980, on the occasion of Miss Bishop's appointment to the Revlon Chair in Cosmetics Marketing at F.I.T., Michel Bergerac, chairman of Revlon, said: ''It is really quite an achievement to carve one outstanding career in a lifetime. To succeed in business, in finance, and in academics in only part of a life is truly an amazing thing.''         Hazel Bishop was born in Hoboken, N.J.. on Aug. 17, 1906, one of two children of Henry and Mabel Bishop. Her father ran a dozen successful enterprises, including numerous stores on Washington Street, the main concourse of Hoboken. One Thanksgiving, he brought Santa Claus to town on an elephant to advertise his candy emporium.         ''The family talk around the dinner table always concerned business,'' Miss Bishop said.         After graduating from Barnard College, Miss Bishop intended to go to medical school, but the stock market crash forced her to take a job as a chemist at Columbia University Medical Center, where she worked for a leading dermatologist, investigating allergies and cosmetics.         In World War II, as senior organic chemist with what is now Exxon, she discovered the cause of deposits affecting superchargers of aircraft engines. After the war, she moved on to what is now Mobil, but in the meantime made her historic discovery.         She is survived by a niece, Randa Bishop of Las Vegas, Nev., and two nephews, Arthur Lipper of Delmar, Calif., and A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J.         Described over the years as demure and trim, with hazel eyes and a weakness for hats, the woman who invented kissable lipstick never married. She said she felt the obligation, in her courting years, to keep her widowed mother company at home.         After she left the business, she still mixed up lipstick for herself, a red shade with a blue cast, and once offered the following beauty advice: ''Women should use makeup to accentuate their most attractive feature. After the age of 25 or thereabouts, personality becomes an increasingly more attractive feature.''       
         Mildred Baker, an arts administrator and trustee emeritus of the Newark Museum, died on Dec. 9 at the Florence Nightingale Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and was a longtime resident of the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.         Born into a musical family in Brooklyn and named Mildred Sophia Weiss, Mrs. Baker became deeply involved with museums and art galleries after marrying an artist, Emil Holzhauer, in 1925. In 1935 she went to work for the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, later becoming its assistant director. She traveled the country selecting artists' works for more than 500 shows that circulated among more than 100 regional centers.         Soon after the W.P.A. closed its doors in 1943, Mrs. Baker joined the staff of the Newark Museum, where she organized a pioneering show called ''Black Artists'' in 1944.         She became the museum's assistant director in 1949 and its associate director in charge of exhibitions, membership and special events in 1953. Besides being responsible for many additions to the permanent collection, Mrs. Baker founded and was the first editor of ''News Notes,'' the museum's monthly bulletin. After her retirement in 1971, she was elected to the museum's board of trustees.         In the 1960's, she was vice chairman of the Commission to Study the Arts in New Jersey, which led to the creation of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, on which she served until 1975.         Mrs. Baker and Mr. Holzhauer were divorced in 1940, and seven years later she married Jacob Baker, a business executive, and they moved into the Chelsea Hotel. After Mr. Baker's death in 1967 she became a close friend of fellow hotel residents, including the composer Virgil Thomson. The two dined together every Saturday night in the Chelsea Hotel apartment of their friends, Gerald Busby, a composer, and Sam Byers, an advertising executive.         Mrs. Baker, who was a member of the board of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, the Friends Committee of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Cosmopolitan Club, remained at the Chelsea until she suffered a stroke last month.         No immediate family members survive.
