         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         Elinor Cocheran Ayers, a former high school teacher who became a leading dog breeder, died on Wednesday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. She was 62 years old and lived in Manchester, Vt. No cause of death was given.         Beginning in 1972, when she moved to Manchester and re-established the Seaward Kennels, which had been started by her mother in 1932, Miss Ayers became a major dog breeder. She specialized in American, Canadian Black and Landseer Newfoundlands.         Her greatest victory came in 1984 when Ch. Seaward's Blackbeard became the only Newfoundland ever to be named best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club's annual fixture at Madison Square Garden.         Before her dog-breeding career, Miss Ayers taught at the Ferry Hall School in Lake Forest, Ill., worked as a guidance counselor at Danbury (Conn.) High School and served as dean of girls at Montclair (N.J.) High School. She is survived by a brother, Stewart ayers, Of St. Petersburg, Fla.       
         Dr. Ruth Landes, an anthropologist who won critical acclaim for her studies of black Brazilians, Indians in North Dakota and Hispanic-Americans in the American Southwest, died on Feb. 11 at her home in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 82 years old.         Dr. Landes's best-known book was "The City of Women," published in 1947 by Macmillan, in which she reported on life around the Brazilian seaport of Bahia, in which women played the dominant roles in a society of descendants of African slaves.         Dr. Landes was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Joseph Schlossberg, a co-founder of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. While attending New York University, where she earned a bachelor's degree, she began a four-year anthropological study of black Jews and of followers of Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement.         She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work and a doctorate from Columbia, under whose auspices she did research among North Dakota's Ojibwa Indians. Her nine published works include studies of other Indian tribes and a treatise on bilingualism and biculturalism in Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Canada and the United States.         Since 1965 Dr. Landes had taught at McMaster University in Hamilton.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Loretta U. Boyce, an educator who helped create a school for gifted and talented black and Hispanic youngsters in Brooklyn, died on Wednesday at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. She was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said her niece, Roslyn Bacon.         Ms. Boyce joined the New York City public school system in the mid-1950's as a kindergarten teacher at Public School 125. She later became an acting assistant principal, assistant superintendent of schools in District 16 and deputy superintendent of schools in District 32.         In 1976, she was named principal of Intermediate School 383, the Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented, a special school she had envisioned for minority-group children. The school's achievements in reading have consistantly ranked it among the top schools in New York City. She retired in 1989.         She is survived by three sisters, Uldine Garrison, Gwendolyn Hurley and Una James, all of Brooklyn.       
         Geraldine N. Moon, vice chairwoman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, died at her home in Camden County on Wednesday. She was 57 years old.         Mrs. Moon died of cancer, said her husband, Hampden.         At her death, she was serving a second two-year term as first vice chairwoman of the committee. Mrs. Moon was also a member of the Democratic National Committee. She was a political associate of Gov. Jim Florio, who is also from Camden County.         She was Winslow Township's deputy tax assessor from 1974 until June 1990, when illness forced a leave of absence.         Mrs. Moon was also the founder of the Camden County chapter of the National Political Congress of Black Women. She graduated from Pierce Business School in Philadelphia and attended Rutgers University in Camden.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six sisters and two brothers.       
         Bennetta Bullock Washington, an educator and a former director of the Women's Job Corps, died Tuesday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 73 years old and lived in Washington.         Dr. Washington, who was being treated for complications from a stroke, died of cardiac arrest, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Imbued with the desire to educate the poor and culturally deprived, Dr. Washington believed that all children, including poor, black, inner-city youngsters, have potential.         The daughter of a prominent Baptist minister, she was the wife of Walter Washington, the first elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. During his tenure, 1967 to 1979, she was regarded as one of his two top advisers.         She began her teaching career in a special school for disturbed youths called Boys Junior-Senior High. She was named principal of Cardozo High School in 1961, where she initiated an academic and work-study program that became a model for the National Teacher Corps.         In 1964 she started a Job Corps program for women, setting up training centers around the country. In 1973 she became an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Labor, specializing in the education, vocational training and counseling of men and women in urban and rural ghettos. She retired in 1981.         Dr. Washington wrote three books about the effects of poverty on the learning process, was a trustee for several colleges and was a member of Presidential committees on youth, hunger and employment of the handicapped.         She graduated from Dunbar High School in Washington and from Howard University, where she receieved her bachelor's and master's degrees. In 1939 she earned a doctorate from Catholic University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Dr. Bennetta Jules-Rosette, an anthropologist, of Leucadia, Calif.; two brothers, Dr. Samuel C. Bullock, of Philadelphia, and Joseph B. Bullock, of Washington; a granddaughter, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Ethel Payne, regarded as the nation's pre-eminent black female journalist, was found dead Thursday in her Washington apartment. She was 79 years old.         Miss Payne apparently died of natural causes on Tuesday and was discovered two days later, said her sister, Avis Johnson of San Diego.         Miss Payne joined The Chicago Defender in 1951 as political correspondent. Based in Washington, she reported from practically every major country except the Soviet Union and Australia. She was the only black correspondent at the 1956 Bandung conference in Indonesia and covered the Nigerian civil war and the Vietnam War. From 1972 to 1978 she did commentaries on CBS radio.         She interviewed heads of state, and entertained Vice President and Mrs. Richard M. Nixon in her Washington home.         Miss Payne, often referred to as "the first lady of the black press," was inducted into the District of Columbia Women's Hall of Fame in 1988. She won awards from the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs and the National Association of Black Journalists.         She is survived by her sister.       
         Shirley E. Naaman, a vice president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, died on Wednesday at Elmhurst General Hospital in Queens. She was 59 years old and lived in Jackson Heights, Queens.         She died of cancer, her daughter, Sheri Naaman-Mujica, said.         Mrs. Naaman joined the staff at Metropolitan Life in 1949 as a file clerk and advanced to become vice president of personal insurance financial management in 1986. A graduate of Fordham University, she was a member of the Coalition of 100 Black Women, Minority Interchange, Corporate Women's Network and Black Achievers in Industry.         Besides her daughter, of Kew Gardens, Queens, Mrs. Naaman is survived by her husband, Walter; her parents, Doris and William Davis of Plattekill, N.Y.; three brothers, Wilbert Davis of Manhattan and Robert and Frank Davis, both of Plattekill; a sister, Yvonne Ellis of San Diego; and two grandchildren.       
         E. Tamu Bess, a former special assistant to Basil Patterson when he was deputy mayor of New York City and New York State Secretary of State, died on Aug. 1 in Midway Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 39 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bess died in surgery after being shot in an attempted robbery in front of the home of a colleague, the Los Angeles police said.         Before Ms. Bess moved to Los Angeles last year, she had worked in politics, philanthropy, social service and the arts in New York City.         In politics, in addition to her work with Mr. Patterson, she helped organize the New York City Black Political Convention in 1982. She had been executive director of the Twenty-First Century Foundation, established to finance eceonomic development in black communities, and was a board member of the Black United Fund. She also helped restructure the summer camp and after-school programs of Minisink Town House, a Harlem settlement house that she attended as a child.         Ms. Bess had worked to produce the 10th anniversary program of the Black Filmmaker Foundation and was talent coordinator for "Spike & Company: Do It A Cappella," broadcast last year by PBS.         In Los Angeles, she worked in film publicity.         In the 1970's she took the name Tamu, which means sweetness in Swahili, and used the initial of her given first name, Evna.         She is survived by her mother, Dorothy T. Ellington Ashley of Washington, and her brother, David Ellington of Los Angeles.       
         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.         Dr. Weaver is believed to have been the first black woman to earn a doctorate in her field, speech correction, audiology and linguistics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Northwestern.         Dr. Weaver graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1932. She taught in speech departments at Roosevelt College in Chicago and Howard University in Washington, as well as Brooklyn College.         In 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson named her husband Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making him the first black Cabinet member in the nation's history. At first, Dr. Weaver remained at Brooklyn College and the Weavers had a commuter marriage. But, Mr. Weaver said yesterday, it was not satisfactory and she retired in 1967 to join him in Washington.         While there, she served as a consultant to the Women's Job Corps, the National Advisory Research Council of the Institute of Dental Research and the Children's Hearing and Speech Center, an affiliate of Children's Hospital.         Besides her husband, Dr. Weaver is survived by a brother, Hampton D. Haith of Winston-Salem, N.C.       
         Erma Campbell, an actress in theater, television and films, died on Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 49 years old.         She died of cancer, said Margo Britton, a friend of the family.         Ms. Campbell appeared in a number of Off Broadway and regional theater productions. In 1990, she won praise for her portrayal of a blues singer in "Ground People," an Off Broadway play about a black minstrel troupe in the 1920's.         She appeared on television in the soap operas "The Guiding Light" and "All My Children," and had a small role in the Woody Allen film "Zelig."         She is survived by her mother, Addie Hutchins of Los Angeles; two sons, Darrin and Raymond, and a daughter, Tracey, all of New York City, and three grandchildren.

         Lydia Cabrera, a scholar and chronicler of Afro-Cuban culture, died at her home in Miami last Thursday of heart failure, according to her companion, Teresa de la Parra. Ms. Cabrera was 91 years old.         An ethnologist, artist, oral historian and writer of folk tales, Ms. Cabrera devoted most of her life to the study of Cuba's African-based culture and religions. Ms. Cabrera's Miami home, up to the time of her death, was a mecca for writers, academics, artists and students of Afro-Cuban culture and intellectual exiles from Cuba.         She produced 23 books about Cuba, including scholarly works and collections of folk tales rooted in Africa and passed down through generations of black Cuban slaves. Her best-known book was El Monte, published in 1954. It is considered the seminal book on santeria, the melange of Roman Catholic and African religious practices that developed in the Caribbean countries and that remains current. The Castro Government last year published El Monte without her permission.         Ms. Cabrera was born in Havana, but developed her interest in Afro-Cuban culture in Paris, where she had gone in 1927 to study Asian religion and art. She moved back to Cuba in 1938 and then fled, first to Madrid and then to Miami, in 1960, after the Cuban revolution. She lived in Spain again in the mid-1970's.         Ms. Cabrera held honorary doctorates from Denison University in Ohio, Redlands University in California and Manhattan College in New York City.         There were no immediate survivors.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Sybil Hart Kooper, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in New York, died yesterday at her home in Brooklyn Heights. She was 66 years old.         She died of breast cancer, a former aide said.         It was because of the cancer that she retired on Oct. 31 from the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division is the state's intermediate appeals court and the Second Judicial Department is in Brooklyn.         Justice Kooper was appointed to the Family Court by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1973, elected to the State Supreme Court two years later and was named by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the Appellate Division in 1985.         A champion of women's rights, she observed in 1982, during a convention of the National Association of Women Judges, that "women judges are sometimes very lonely."         She added, in an interview: "Through this organization we've gained a sense of identification and belonging. We've enhanced our sense of personal worth, price, strength." Notable Murder Trials         During her judicial career, she presided at some notable murder trials. Among them was the racially motivated slaying of a black transit worker, William Turks, by a group of white youths in 1983. When Justice Kooper sentenced a defendant, Gino Bova, to a 5-15 year sentence, she said with stinging terseness that there had been "a lynch mob" on the Brooklyn street that night. "The only thing missing was a rope and a tree," she said.         Justice Kooper, who born in Brooklyn, attended Wellesley College and graduated from the New York Law School. As an attorney, she specialized in family law before being named to the Family Court. Her father, Walter R. Hart, was also a justice of the State Supreme Court and rose to become Presiding Justice of the Appellate Term, Second Department.         Not long before she went on the bench, Justice Kooper sued to gain admittance to the 130-member citywide Metropolitan Trial Lawyers Association, contending that she had been excluded because of her sex. The suit was eventually settled and she became the association's first female member.         One appellate opinion she wrote concerned the boycott of the Red Apple grocery operated by Koreans in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Her finding in that case was that police officers were obliged to implement an order by a lower court that said demonstrators must remain at least 50 feet away from the store's entrance.         She is survived by her husband, Justice William C. Thompson of the Appellate Division; three sons from her first marriage, to Robert Ross, which ended in divorce: John Hart Ross of Washington D.C., James Franklin Ross and William Stewart Ross, both of Brooklyn, and a daughter from her second marriage, to Stanley E. Kooper, Dr. Grace Kooper, of Cumberland, R.I.       
         Sybil Hart Kooper, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in New York, died on Wednesday at her home in Brooklyn Heights. She was 66 years old.

She added, in an interview: "Through this organization we've gained a sense of identification and belonging. We've enhanced our sense of personal worth, price, strength."         During her judicial career, she presided at some notable murder trials. Among them was the racially motivated slaying of a black transit worker, William Turks, by a group of white youths in 1983. When Justice Kooper sentenced a defendant, Gino Bova, to a 5-15 year sentence, she said with stinging terseness that there had been "a lynch mob" on the Brooklyn street that night. "The only thing missing was a rope and a tree," she said.         Justice Kooper, who born in Brooklyn, attended Wellesley College and graduated from the New York Law School. As an attorney, she specialized in family law before being named to the Family Court. Her father, Walter R. Hart, was also a justice of the State Supreme Court and rose to become Presiding Justice of the Appellate Term, Second Department.         Not long before she went on the bench, Justice Kooper sued to gain admittance to the 130-member citywide Metropolitan Trial Lawyers Association, contending that she had been excluded because of her sex. The suit was eventually settled and she became the association's first female member.         One appellate opinion she wrote concerned the boycott of the Red Apple grocery operated by Koreans in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Her finding in that case was that police officers were obliged to carry out an order by a lower court that said demonstrators must remain at least 50 feet away from the store's entrance.         She is survived by her husband, Justice William C. Thompson of the Appellate Division; three sons from her first marriage, to Robert Ross, which ended in divorce: John Hart Ross of Washington D.C., James Franklin Ross and William Stewart Ross, both of Brooklyn, and a daughter from her second marriage, to Stanley E. Kooper, Dr. Grace Kooper, of Cumberland, R.I.         Correction:  December 14, 1991, Saturday         An obituary headline yesterday about a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court rendered her name and age incorrectly in some editions. She was Sybil Hart Kooper, and she was 66 years old.
